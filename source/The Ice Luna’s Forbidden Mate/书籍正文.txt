###Chapter 0001

"Nathan, are you ready?" Grayson's voice cut through the air, impatient as always. He raked a hand through his shaggy black hair, pushing it away from those piercing blue eyes. I had to admit—he was hot. Towering at 6'1" with muscles that could rival a Greek god, but he wasn’t my type. Fun to tease, sure, but nothing more.

"Almost."

I was the Alpha’s daughter. Grayson, my twin brother, was the leader of our tight-knit group—our little pack. He was every girl’s fantasy: sharp jawline, dark brown eyes, and a stubble that somehow made him look even better. Built like a warrior, he carried himself with the confidence of someone who knew his worth.

Being his twin meant we looked eerily similar, though he never let me forget he was four minutes older—and thus, the heir to the Alpha title. That left me free to do whatever I wanted, which happened to be tattooing. I’d started at fifteen, and now, just shy of eighteen, I was finishing up Nathan’s latest piece.

"I need this done before my date this weekend," Nathan said, flashing a grin.

I rolled my eyes. He had a new girl every week—I’d stopped bothering to learn their names.

Our school was a mix of humans and werewolves, with three rival packs under one roof. Ours was the Crimson Fang Pack. Then there were the Silvercrest and Nightshade packs. Mostly, we kept things civil, but tensions simmered beneath the surface.

"Relax, I’ll make sure you don’t embarrass us," I said, prepping the needle. He was getting our pack’s crest—a snarling wolf with crimson dripping from its fangs. Dramatic? Maybe. But it suited us.

"Thanks, Scarlett."

That was my nickname. Grayson was "Blaze"—hot, reckless, and impossible to ignore. Me? I was "Scarlett" because of the icy wall I kept around my heart. Long, wild curls, curves that turned heads, legs that went on for days—I could have anyone I wanted. But Grayson had a habit of scaring them off.

Once, he’d beaten a guy to a pulp just for kissing me. After that, no one dared cross him.

Nathan leaned back as I set up, just as Grayson and the others walked in. "You skipped the last hour?" Grayson asked, arms crossed.

Ignoring him, I started on Nathan’s tattoo. He flinched, growling under his breath.

"Don’t," I warned. I might be a girl, but Alpha blood ran through my veins. I could put any of them on their asses if I wanted.

"Wasn’t ready," he muttered.

"Tough."

"Scarlett," Grayson pressed, sitting down.

Liam, the one I actually wanted but could never have, leaned against the wall. The Beta’s son—quiet, brooding, with honey-brown hair and eyes that made my stomach flip. He was the type to watch the chaos unfold without saying a word. And damn, did I want to climb into his lap and wreck his composure.

"I heard you. I didn’t want to go," I said, dipping the needle into ink.

Grayson’s voice darkened. "Why? Something happen?"

Thankfully, the door swung open, and Sophia walked in. Nathan had been pining after her for years, but she shut him down every time. Now, he dated random girls just to get a reaction—which only made her roll her eyes harder.

Sophia was sunshine in human form—strawberry blonde curls, freckles, and blue eyes that could cut through steel. She was also one of the best fighters in our pack—second only to me.

"How’s it going?" she asked, leaning over to inspect my work.

"Just finishing up Nathan’s tattoo," I said, wiping the excess ink away.

"Sissy boy?" Nathan shot me a look.

"Relax, it’s a joke."

The bell chimed again, and this time, the air shifted.

A stranger walked in.

And holy hell.

He gave Liam a run for his money. Black hair slicked back, green eyes locked onto me like a predator. A leather jacket barely contained his build, and those tight jeans paired with biker boots? Deadly.

Shaking off the sudden heat in my veins, I forced my voice steady. "What are you looking for?"

"I was told to ask for Evelyn. Heard she’s the best."

"That’s me." My tone sharpened. Most called me Evie. Close friends used Scarlett. Only a handful dared use Evelyn.

His surprise flickered, but he recovered fast. "I want something like this." He pulled out a sketch—a wolf howling at the moon, intricate and bold.

"Where?"

"My back. Full coverage. Just got back from training—wanted to mark it."

"Name?" Grayson cut in.

The stranger turned. "Sebastian. Alpha Benjamin’s son—Silvercrest Pack." He extended a hand.

Grayson stood, tension coiling between them. "Grayson Andrews. Crimson Fang Alpha’s son. That’s my sister, Evelyn. Sophia, future Gamma. Nathan, future Beta. Liam, my right hand."

Sebastian nodded. "Not here to cause trouble. Just finishing my last year before I transfer."

I couldn’t help it. "Transfer where?"

Grayson shot me a glare, but Sebastian smirked. "More training."

"That piece will run you $1,500. Multiple sessions. Depends on your pain tolerance."

"Got references?"

I pointed to the portfolio. He flipped through it, and I studied him. Mysterious. Dangerous. But not in the way I expected.

When Nathan’s tattoo was done, I cleaned up, snapping a photo for my records.

Grayson lingered, reluctance in his stance.

"I’m fine," I mind-linked.

"Don’t trust him."

"Sophia’s here. Dad will skin you if you’re late again."

He relented. "Tell me the second he leaves."

"Yes, sir," I mocked.

Once they were gone, Sophia whistled. "If you don’t climb that man like a tree, I will."

I snorted. "Grayson would murder him."

"Worth it."

Locking up, I caught Sebastian watching me from across the street. His gaze burned through me, sending shivers down my spine.

There was something primal in his eyes.

Something that called to the wolf inside me.

###Chapter 0002

"Where were you two?" Margaret's shrill voice cut through the air as Evelyn and Sophia parked their bikes outside the pack house. As Luna of the Silvercrest Pack, she had a habit of micromanaging every aspect of Evelyn's life. Nothing ever satisfied her.

At barely 5'4", Margaret was deceptively petite. But her iron will made her formidable when she set her mind to something. She rarely gave Evelyn the benefit of the doubt, always assuming the worst. Grayson was the only one who could see through her manipulations. She wasn't their biological mother - their real mother had died during childbirth, and their father Alexander had mated with Margaret within the year. Grayson was Alexander's spitting image, while Evelyn favored their late mother.

"We were at the tattoo parlor. We're going for a run before meeting the guys for pizza," Evelyn replied, coming to a stop in front of her stepmother.

"Absolutely not! You haven't completed any of the chores I assigned you!" A vein pulsed dangerously in Margaret's forehead.

"I finished them this morning before school! Did you even check before accusing me?" Evelyn snapped, her temper flaring.

"What's going on here?" Alexander emerged from the pack house with Grayson and the other warriors in tow.

"Your daughter is neglecting her responsibilities again and being insolent! This is the last straw!" Margaret raised her hand to strike Evelyn, but Grayson intercepted her wrist mid-swing.

"You won't lay a hand on her," Grayson growled, his eyes narrowing dangerously.

"You insolent brat!"

"Margaret, that's enough. Evelyn, did you complete your chores?" Alexander crossed his arms over his broad chest.

"Yes, Alpha. I finished them before first period."

"She's lying!" Margaret shrieked.

Evelyn pulled out her phone with shaking hands. "See?" She showed her father the timestamped email, deliberately bypassing Margaret.

"Looks like she's telling the truth," Alexander nodded. "What are your plans for tonight?"

"Sophia and I were going for a run, then meeting the guys at Moonhowl Pizzeria."

"That's what she told me," Grayson confirmed.

"Very well. Enjoy your run." Alexander handed back her phone.

"I also emailed you today's client report. Alpha Benjamin's son came in requesting a full back piece. I gave him the consent forms - he's scheduled to start tomorrow at 4pm."

Alexander studied her for a long moment. "I'll stop by then."

"That's it? No consequences for her disrespect?" Margaret trailed after Alexander as he walked away.

"What did you do to set her off this time?" Grayson asked once they were alone.

"We literally just got home. She was waiting to ambush me." Evelyn exhaled sharply. "I can't wait to leave this place. The moment I turn eighteen, I'm gone."

"Running away isn't the solution."

"What other choice do I have? You won't become Alpha for seven more years. I can't endure this for that long."

"What if your mate is here?" Grayson's question made all three warriors flinch as if struck.

"Then I hope he likes traveling, because I'll be exploring the world for the next seven years." Evelyn disappeared into her closet, emerging in black compression shorts and a neon pink sports bra layered under a razorback tank.

She gathered her dark hair into a messy ponytail. "Look, I know you disagree, but what alternative do I suggest? There's only so much one person can take without any support."

"I support you," Grayson said quietly.

"And I appreciate that, brother. But you can't always be there to shield me from the physical blows."

Grayson's jaw clenched. "I hate that."

"It's fine. You've hit me harder during training." She forced a smile as she grabbed her running shoes.

"That's completely different."

"I love you, but this is my only option." Slipping on her shoes, she added, "I need to run." She debated adding another sports bra - her generous curves sometimes made running uncomfortable.

"Ready?" Sophia bounced into the room.

"Let's go!" Evelyn was grateful for her friend's cheerful presence.

"See you boys later!"

"We'll be at Moonhowl in an hour!" Nathan called after them.

As they sprinted past Alexander's office, Evelyn caught snippets of Margaret's ongoing tirade. The door was ajar, but she didn't dare linger.

"Which route?" Sophia adjusted her earbuds.

"Let's take the scenic route through downtown. We can loop around to the pizzeria." Center Town served as neutral territory for all nearby packs, housing their shared high school.

The ten-mile run flew by as their long legs ate up the distance. With each stride, Evelyn's tension melted away until only the rhythm of her footfalls remained. Even her music faded into the background.

"Feels like we ran forever," Sophia panted as they reached the cobblestone streets of downtown.

"You've been eating too many gummies," Evelyn teased, barely winded. Moonhowl Pizzeria buzzed with activity, packed with both wolf and human teenagers.

Nathan sat in the far corner with a human girl draped over him. As they wove through the crowd, the girl gave them a once-over that immediately set Evelyn's teeth on edge.

"Finally decided to show up?" the girl sneered.

"Had to work for these figures. Where's my drink?" Evelyn scanned the table.

"Grayson's not here yet," Liam said from across the table, ignoring the human girl batting her eyelashes at him. His subtle head shake told Evelyn he wasn't interested.

"There's seating over there. Why don't you sit there?" the human girl suggested boldly.

Nathan and Liam exchanged glances. "Excuse me?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

"Just...go order drinks and three large pizzas. I'll handle this," Nathan said quickly.

"Please do," Evelyn said coolly before turning toward the counter. She didn't see the broad-shouldered figure step back until his boot crushed her toes.

"Watch where you're—"

Emerald green eyes met hers as the stranger looked down at her hopping on one foot, then slowly trailed up her body. Her stomach did an unexpected flip. "My apologies—"

"Is there a problem?" A she-wolf materialized beside Sebastian, draping herself over him possessively.

Evelyn straightened. "He stepped on me." She met the she-wolf's challenging stare without flinching.

"Isabella, this is Alpha Alexander's daughter, Evelyn," Sebastian said tightly.

The she-wolf's tone turned saccharine but her eyes remained hostile. "Pleasure." She didn't offer her hand.

"Likewise." Evelyn moved past them to the counter.

"Hey Evelyn! The usual?" Wendy, a packmate from her grade, smiled from behind the register.

"Please!"

"Put it on Alpha Grayson's tab?"

"Perfect."

Behind her, Isabella muttered, "Stuck-up bitch thinks she owns the place." Wendy's eyes widened.

Evelyn turned slowly. "Let me clarify something." She released a controlled pulse of alpha energy, careful not to affect nearby humans. "As Alpha Alexander's daughter, I expect basic respect. If that's too difficult, we can settle this outside."

"No need for that," Sebastian said coldly, gripping Isabella's arm like a misbehaving child. "I'll deal with her disrespect. My apologies on her behalf."

Evelyn withdrew her aura as the gathered crowd dispersed. "I don't give second chances," she told Sebastian directly.

"Duly noted."

"Evelyn?" Wendy called softly.

She watched Sebastian drag Isabella outside before accepting the drink glasses with a smile. Most pack members knew better than to challenge her.

"Need help?" Grayson appeared with his girlfriend Victoria.

"Please." She handed them the glasses.

"What's with Alpha Sebastian?" Grayson asked as they returned to the crowded table.

"His girlfriend was being rude. I offered to handle it outside, but he insisted on disciplining her himself." The circular table forced them to sit shoulder-to-shoulder, with Evelyn wedged against Liam. He lifted his arm to rest it behind her seat - a practical adjustment rather than a romantic one.

"How was your run?" Nathan's human companion asked timidly.

"Good. Helps clear my mind." Evelyn kept her tone neutral, noticing Nathan's relieved exhale.

"I wish I enjoyed running," the girl said, sipping her drink.

"So how's business?" Victoria asked. Evelyn didn't invest much in Grayson's relationships - until he found his mate or declared real love, she remained cautiously distant.

"Booming. Already surpassing last year's numbers." The pizzas arrived then.

"I ordered three larges!" Nathan protested at the mountain of food.

"You three can each eat a whole pizza," Evelyn pointed out. Grayson usually ordered five and still left nothing behind.

As conversation flowed around her, Evelyn's gaze drifted until it locked with familiar emerald green eyes near the entrance. Sebastian motioned for her to join him outside.

"Be right back." She excused herself.

"Want company?" Liam mind-linked.

"No. Probably wants to ensure I don't murder his girlfriend." She felt his disapproval. Their occasional drunken make-out sessions never progressed further, but he always showed faint jealousy.

Outside, Sebastian leaned against his motorcycle. "Wasn't sure you'd come out." The way his voice rumbled made the hairs on her arms stand at attention.

###Chapter 0003

I ignored his remark. "What do you want?"

"Evelyn, Isabella can be impulsive, but she's transferring too. I don’t want drama at school." For a second, I almost felt let down—almost.

"As long as she stays in her lane. If not, I’ll remind her." It wasn’t a threat. It was a fact.

Sebastian nodded, understanding. "Why does Grayson call you Scarlett?"

"That name’s for people I actually like."

"That’s not an answer."

"I’m not exactly the cuddly type." I kept it vague.

"Scarlett?" Liam’s voice cut in, clearly done waiting. Sebastian didn’t react, just studied his body language.

"Your boyfriend?"

"No. See you tomorrow." I turned away before he could respond. Liam held the door open for me. Sebastian’s bike roared to life as the door shut behind us.

"What was that about?" Nathan demanded, irritation clear in his tone.

"His ex is transferring here. He doesn’t want trouble." I shrugged.

"What did you say?" Grayson asked, voice sharp.

"As long as she knows her place, we’re good. Though I’d hate to have to remind her."

"Hate? Bullshit." Liam scoffed.

"Your reputation alone should scare her off." Sophia laughed.

"One fight, and suddenly I’m the school’s resident bad girl." I sighed.

"It wasn’t just one fight. You put her in a coma." Nathan smirked.

"She needed to learn her place." I wasn’t hungry, but I didn’t want to go home.

"Let’s go." Grayson finished his drink.

"You girls need a ride?" Nathan offered.

"No, I want to walk."

"It’s getting dark," Liam warned, glancing outside.

"Thanks, Dad. I hadn’t noticed." Annoyed, I stood and headed for the door. Sophia followed quickly.

"You know you’ll be in trouble if you’re late," she murmured.

She was right, but I hated Margaret. "I’ll be in trouble no matter what." The rumble of bikes approached behind us.

"Come on, sis. Get on." Nathan held out his hand. I sighed and climbed on. Sophia took Liam’s bike, and we sped toward the pack house.

The ride was short—five minutes, and I was back in hell. Nathan dropped us at the front while he parked in the garage. The moment we stepped inside, movement flickered in my periphery.

SLAP!

The sting exploded across my cheek, whipping my head to the side. The force nearly knocked me off balance.

"Stupid girl! How dare you disrespect me!" Margaret shrieked.

Rage burned through me. Before I could think, I stepped forward and struck back—harder. She crumpled to the floor, wailing.

"WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?" Alexander bellowed. I knew I was screwed, but I didn’t care.

"I walked in, and she hit me! I’m done, Dad! Done being treated like trash by someone who isn’t even my mother! I hate it here! The second I turn eighteen, I’m gone, and you’ll never see me again. So punish me. I don’t care anymore!" The guys entered as I ranted, tears and blood from my split lip streaking my face. Without waiting for a response, I bolted upstairs, slamming my door shut.

Adrenaline buzzed under my skin. I needed to hit something. Thank God Nathan had installed a punching bag. My vision tunneled as I unleashed on it, knuckles splitting open.

Only when strong arms wrapped around me, pinning me against a solid chest, did I snap back to reality. My hands were bloody, arms aching.

"Scarlett! Breathe!" Nathan’s voice was firm. "I’m sorry, sis."

My breathing steadied. Liam and Grayson were there too. "Sophia went home," Liam said, reading my mind.

"Shower. Then bed," Nathan ordered, releasing me. Liam cupped my chin, inspecting my lip.

"It’s fine," I muttered, pulling away.

"Dad’s giving you tonight to cool off. You’ll see him in the morning."

"Okay." Relief flickered. "Thanks."

They left, and my phone buzzed. Ignoring it, I tossed it onto the bed and headed for the shower.

The hot water burned my raw knuckles, but I welcomed the pain. By the time it ran cold, I was numb. Dressed in pajamas, I collapsed into bed. My phone buzzed again.

Sophia: You okay?

Me: Yeah.

Sophia: Liar. We’ll talk tomorrow. Maybe Liam can distract you?

Me: Night…

A small smile tugged at my lips as sleep dragged me under.

Morning came too soon. I dressed quickly—Margaret was still asleep, so I knew Alexander would be alone in his office. I braided my hair, applied light makeup to hide the bruise, and slipped into flowy shorts with a black bodysuit. Sandals on, I headed to his office.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

"Come in." His voice was heavy.

"Hi, Dad." I sat, skipping formalities since it was just us.

"Evelyn, explain."

"She makes my life hell because I look like Mom. All I did was walk in, and she attacked me. I shouldn’t have hit back, but I’m done taking her abuse." My voice cracked, but I held firm.

"Grayson said you’re leaving at eighteen."

"Yes. I can’t stay here with her."

"You can’t go around hitting Margaret," he started.

"Just once, can you be my dad? Actually listen to me?" I interrupted.

"Evelyn, I love you."

Standing, I clenched my fists. "Alpha, just give me my punishment so I can go to school." If he wouldn’t act like a father, I wouldn’t treat him like one.

"Don’t do this," he said, disappointed.

A knock saved me. Beta Andrew peered in. "Sorry, I can come back—"

"I need to get to school," I said flatly.

"We’re not done," Alexander warned as I turned to leave.

"Yes, sir."

I bolted to the garage, hopped on my bike, and took off—alone.

The wind was freedom. In my rush, I’d forgotten my helmet. Not that it mattered—I healed fast. My knuckles were scabbed but still angry.

The school lot was nearly empty. Parking, I headed to a picnic table, plugged in my earbuds, and lost myself in sketching—a phoenix, wings spread, engulfed in flames. I didn’t notice Liam approaching until he tapped my shoulder.

"Shit!" I jumped, nearly dropping my pencil.

He sat across from me, eyes scanning my lip and hands. "You okay?"

"Always." I tucked my music away.

"Evelyn." Full name. Never good.

Setting my pencil down, I met his gaze. "What do you want me to say? That I’m great? That I’m thriving? I’m miserable, Liam. Is it too much to ask for a dad who chooses me?" My voice rose. Liam reached over, taking my hand.

"I wish I could take it away."

The intimacy of it sent a jolt through me. "Seven more years till Grayson takes over," I deflected.

"Your birthday’s coming. What if your mate’s in this pack?" We’d danced around us before, but it never felt right.

"School’s almost over. Maybe he’ll want a vacation."

"What if he can’t?" He meant himself. Once Grayson turned eighteen, Alpha training would consume him—and Liam and Nathan by extension.

"I’ll send postcards."

The schoolyard had filled up without me noticing. The first bell rang.

Liam frowned as we stood. I felt eyes on me—Sebastian, watching. Isabella clung to him. The urge to punch her flared, but I turned away, heading to class.

The morning dragged. Lectures were mind-numbing. Advanced classes meant I should pay attention, but I couldn’t.

Last before lunch: Advanced Calculus. The door opened, and Sebastian walked in with Oliver, his beta-to-be. Sebastian scanned the room, spotted me, and sat on the opposite side. Oliver took the seat beside him. I stayed in the back—always did. I hated not knowing what was behind me.

Occasionally, I felt his gaze, but I focused on my sketch. The teacher reviewed last semester’s material, so I tuned out, shading the phoenix’s wings.

Most didn’t know I’d tested out of high school three years ago. Genius IQ. I’d stayed to avoid being a freak. The teachers knew—they never called on me, never cared if I skipped. They were wolves. They knew who I was.

The bell finally rang. "Miss Evelyn, a word?"

The room emptied—except Sebastian and Oliver. "Miss Carter, this is Sebastian and Oliver. They wanted to introduce themselves."

"Ah. Alpha Benjamin’s son?" She eyed him.

"Yes, ma’am."

"Nice to meet you. But being an Alpha’s son doesn’t excuse missed work." She glared. I stood awkwardly to the side.

"Understood." Annoyance flickered in his voice.

"Miss Evelyn, can I count on you again this year?"

I smirked. "Of course, ma’am."

"Perfect. I’ll email details."

"Great." I turned to leave.

"Wait!" Sebastian caught up. "Evelyn, this is Oliver. My beta. Oliver, Alpha Alexander’s daughter."

"Nice to meet you," Oliver said politely.

I arched a brow at his formality. "You too. Now, if you’ll excuse me..." My stomach growled.

"Still on for this afternoon?" Sebastian called.

"Yes, sir," I tossed over my shoulder. They followed, but I didn’t care.

I needed food.

###Chapter 0004

The cafeteria line moved quickly, allowing me to grab my tray and find a seat without delay. Like every other school cafeteria, packs occupied their usual corners while humans filled the remaining spaces.

"Scarlett!" Nathan called out, waving me over.

"Damn, you don’t look half bad," Sophia remarked, eyeing my split lip.

"I’ve survived worse," I shrugged, feeling at ease surrounded by my personal bodyguards.

"Did you talk to Dad?" Grayson asked between bites.

"Briefly, before Andrew interrupted."

"What’s your punishment?" Sophia pressed, her expression tense.

"Nothing... yet." The hamburger tasted bland, but I welcomed the sustenance. As conversation shifted, my mind wandered to my ever-growing to-do list.

"Scarlett, you in?" Liam’s voice snapped me back to reality.

"Huh?"

"Club tomorrow. It’s Friday—you know we always go Saturdays."

"No dress. You idiots keep ruining them with your spilled drinks," I shot back, narrowing my eyes.

"We can shop tonight!" Sophia clapped excitedly.

"Can’t. Tattoo appointment."

"Fine, I’ll pick something for you. I know your size!"

"Don’t you dare bring back anything pink," I warned, pointing my butter knife at her.

Laughter erupted around the table, and for the first time today, I felt myself relax. Nights out were my escape, my way of drowning out the chaos.

Lunch ended too soon. Tray discarded, I headed to my next class—college-level accounting. Only three other students qualified for this course.

Until today.

Sebastian strode in, Oliver trailing behind. Class hadn’t started yet, so they took the seats beside me.

"You’re in all the advanced classes?" Sebastian asked.

"Obviously."

"Why this one?" He pressed.

"I own a business. You really need me to spell it out?" I arched a brow.

"What happened to your lip?" Oliver interjected.

Sebastian’s gaze snapped to it, anger flashing in his eyes. "Nothing."

"And your knuckles?" Oliver wasn’t letting go.

"Let’s begin!" Mr. Engle’s timely interruption saved me from answering.

"Before we start—Ms. Evelyn, can I count on you again this year?"

"Already on my list," I confirmed.

Sebastian shot me a sidelong glance but stayed quiet. When class ended, Mr. Engle detained him, giving me a clean escape.

At least until 4 PM, when he’d show up at my shop. Which was in thirty minutes.

Now, I sat at my front desk, transferring his design onto stencil paper. The guys hadn’t arrived yet. Neither had Dad.

The printer hummed as the door chimed. "Hello."

Sebastian and Oliver walked in. Oddly, their presence didn’t unsettle me. Maybe it should have.

"Bathroom’s there if you need it. Paperwork and payment ready?"

"Right here." Sebastian placed both on the counter.

"Perfect." I skimmed the forms, verifying his signature.

While Sebastian disappeared into the restroom, Oliver flipped through my portfolio. "This place is yours?"

"Yep. All my work."

"Impressive."

The door swung open again—Grayson, Liam, and Nathan strolled in. "Grayson, meet Oliver, Sebastian’s future beta. Oliver, this is my twin, Grayson. We’re Alpha Alexander’s kids. Then there’s future beta Liam and gamma Nathan."

Handshakes were exchanged as Sebastian returned.

"Grayson," Sebastian greeted, clasping his hand.

"Ready?" I asked Sebastian.

"Yeah."

"Shirt off, face down." He complied, and I prepped my tools.

"How’s the move treating you?" Grayson made small talk.

"Adjusting, but it’s good," Oliver replied.

"Relax, all of you. You look like you’ve got sticks up your asses," I deadpanned.

Sebastian snorted but stayed still. I positioned the stencil, pressed it onto his skin, and peeled it back carefully. "Mirror’s there. Check the placement."

He rose, and damn if his body wasn’t sculpted perfection. Every muscle defined, every movement effortless.

"Looks good."

Back on the table, he barely flinched as I started the needle.

"Scarlett, did you get those teacher emails?" Grayson asked.

"Two of them asked me in person today."

"What was that about?" Oliver frowned.

"Miss Perfect here’s been running school events since eighth grade," Nathan grumbled, always bitter about my academic streak.

"Five years? You’re a senior." Oliver looked baffled.

"Not a big deal. I handle the planning; others do the grunt work. Spelling bees, prom, rallies—you name it."

"You’ve done this since middle school?" Sebastian asked, voice muffled against the table.

"One of my many talents."

"Scarlett, we gotta head out. You good?" Grayson linked mentally.

"Yeah, go ahead."

They stood. "See you at dinner," Grayson called before leaving. Liam lingered, giving me a look I couldn’t decipher, then followed.

"That your boyfriend?" Oliver smirked.

"Hardly. We’ve known each other since birth. Our birthdays are a week apart."

"So how smart are you?" Oliver prodded.

I gave him a are-you-serious look.

"Advanced classes, event planning—"

"I’m an enigma," I quipped as the door opened. "Hey, Dad."

Oliver shot to his feet. Sebastian tensed but stayed down at Dad’s dismissive wave.

"Just checking in," Dad said, shaking Oliver’s hand before examining my work. "Solid design. Who drew it?"

"I did, sir," Sebastian answered.

"How late are you working?"

"Not sure. Want to finish the linework tonight. Maybe shading if he can handle it."

Dad set a takeout bag on my desk. "Dinner. And don’t bother stopping by my office later."

I paused. No punishment?

"Boys, respect isn’t optional."

"Yes, sir," Oliver replied. Dad nodded and left.

"Mind if I order pizza?" Oliver asked.

"Go ahead. Address is on the card—better signal outside."

Once Oliver left, Sebastian turned his head, fingers brushing my lip. The touch was equal parts concern and something hotter. "Who did this?"

"Not your concern."

"I asked around. Rumors say your dad hits you."

My jaw dropped. "My father has never laid a hand on me."

"Your stepmom, then?"

"She’s not my mother. Mine died when I was little." I nudged his shoulder, trying to get him flat again. He resisted.

"You need help?"

"Please. Between Grayson and his crew, I’ve got enough protection."

He finally relented. "That’s obvious. So, you and Liam?"

"Like I said—no. Why do you care?"

"Don’t want to step on toes."

"Isabella’s not your girl?"

"She wishes. Not my type."

"You let girls hang all over you but don’t date them? Player much?"

"Actually, no. I’m picky."

"How old are you?"

"Turned 18 last month."

"No mate?"

"Still looking."

"Are you? Seems like training eats all your time."

"This session’s only a week. Then I’m home for good."

Oliver returned. "Pizza’s coming. What’d I miss?"

"When’s your birthday?" I asked.

"Tomorrow, actually."

"Happy early birthday."

"Thanks. Still figuring out plans."

Right on cue, Sophia burst in. "Look what I got you!" She waved a neon pink dress so tiny it might as well have been a napkin. Oliver’s eyes nearly popped out.

"You’re joking. I’m not wearing that!"

"Gotcha! This one’s mine. This is yours." She revealed a sleek black dress with a plunging neckline and thigh-high slit.

"Better."

"Where are you wearing those?" Oliver asked, leaning in.

"Club. Actually, scratch tomorrow—we’re going tonight." Sophia planted a hand on her hip, daring me to argue.

"Sure."

"Wait—just like that?"

"No punishment, no problem. Let’s go."

"Punishment for what?" Oliver’s gaze sharpened.

"She slapped—"

"Sophia! Shut it!" I snapped.

"Tell me," Oliver demanded, tilting her chin up.

She caved instantly. "Luna Margaret."

"No fucking way!" Oliver gaped.

"She hit me first," I muttered, focusing on the tattoo.

Sebastian’s hand settled on my knee, thumb stroking my thigh—hidden from view.

"Pizza’s here!" Oliver headed out. Sophia ducked into the bathroom. When Oliver returned, he stared at the door, frowning.

"What’s wrong?" I asked. Sebastian lifted his head.

"Dude?"

"How old is Sophia?"

"Eighteen."

Oliver set his pizza down slowly. "I think... she might be my mate."

Sebastian and I exchanged glances.

"Why?"

"Just a feeling. Sebastian, we’re going out tonight."

Sebastian groaned. "Aw, fuck."

"Brought makeup so we can get ready here!" Sophia announced, reappearing.

"You tell Grayson?"

"Yeah. They’ll meet us there—no way we’re riding bikes in these dresses."

"You got shoes?"

"Got everything, babe."

I mind-linked Dad. "Going out tonight."

"Grayson told me. Stay with him."

"Thanks, Dad."

My mood lifted instantly. "Pain level?"

"Can you stop soon?"

"Almost. Let me finish this section." My stool positioned his head between my thighs as I worked his shoulders.

###Chapter 0005

"I'm ready!" Sophia emerged from the bathroom, looking absolutely stunning in her dress. The side strings cinched her waist perfectly, accentuating her curves in all the right places.

"Damn." Oliver's jaw practically hit the floor. Grayson and I exchanged amused glances before bursting into laughter. Being around them felt effortless.

"Eat your heart out," Sophia quipped, quoting Grease with that signature confidence of hers that always made me a little envious.

"Alright, let me clean this up," I said, spraying cool, soapy water over the fresh tattoo.

Sebastian stood and walked over to the mirror, the rest of us trailing behind him. "That looks incredible so far."

"Thanks, Oliver."

Sebastian remained silent, studying the artwork on his skin. "Give it some time to heal."

"Can we continue on Wednesday?" Sebastian asked.

"Sure. It should be healed enough by then." I jotted it down in my schedule. "Here are the aftercare instructions and some lotion to keep it moisturized."

"Isabella would love rubbing that on for you," Oliver teased.

"Do NOT let her—or anyone—use their fingernails," I warned, irritation creeping into my voice. "I charge extra for fixing screw-ups."

"Noted," Sebastian said before heading out the door.

"Alright, girl, let’s get you cleaned up!" Sophia clapped her hands together.

"I'm your doll," I muttered, secretly loving the pampering but refusing to admit it.

She made me sit as she carefully unbraided my hair. An hour later, after what felt like an entire can of dry shampoo and half a bottle of gel, my natural curls framed my face beautifully. The dress hugged every curve, stopping just short of scandalous, and—let’s just say—my assets were on full display.

"Where are those guys?" Sophia huffed, checking her watch.

"I need to eat anyway," I said, unwrapping the sandwich and chips my dad had brought me earlier.

"Don’t ruin my masterpiece," Sophia warned, eyeing my food.

I was halfway through my meal when the guys finally walked in.

"Ready?" Grayson was dressed head-to-toe in black. Nathan wore a deep red silk shirt with black slacks, while Liam had on a crisp white button-up, sleeves rolled up, untucked. Victoria was with them, looking elegant in a sapphire satin dress that shimmered under the lights.

"Nathan, roll your sleeves," I instructed. His shirt was tucked in neatly, but the sleeves needed adjusting. The top buttons were undone, revealing just enough to be tantalizing.

"Help me," Nathan said, walking over to Victoria.

Liam leaned against my counter, his gaze lingering a little too long on my cleavage.

"See something you like?" I teased.

"Maybe."

Grayson was used to our playful banter. I assumed he knew about the occasional make-out sessions, but he never brought it up.

"I'm done eating. Let’s go!" I announced.

I didn’t need to show ID, but I handed mine to Grayson anyway. He tucked it into his wallet while Nathan took Sophia’s. Grabbing my keys, I locked up, and we all piled into the SUV. There were too many of us for a sports car tonight.

The bar we frequented was technically owned by Grayson and me, though we operated it under a different name to keep things low-key. Located in neutral human territory, it attracted packs from all over. Fighting was strictly prohibited, so aside from the occasional drunk idiot, it was usually peaceful.

The valet took the keys from Grayson as we stepped out. My red-bottom heels clicked against the pavement until we reached the plush carpet leading inside.

"Sir Grayson, Ms. Evelyn," the bouncer greeted us respectfully. He was pack, but in public, formalities mattered.

The moment we stepped inside, the bass-heavy music vibrated through the floor. The entrance opened to a balcony overlooking the main dance floor. To the right, another set of stairs led to the VIP section. To the left, a bar and more stairs descended to the lower level, which housed another bar, the dance floor, and a rec room with pool tables and arcade games.

Sophia and I leaned over the balcony railing, watching the crowd below while Grayson and Nathan headed to the bar. Liam stood beside us like a damn bodyguard, all brooding intensity.

"This place is packed!" I grinned, exhilaration bubbling up inside me.

"I know! I need a drink first," Sophia shouted over the music.

It was still early, but the place was already buzzing. We followed Liam up to the VIP section, where our drinks were waiting. Sophia got her usual vodka cranberry, while I opted for Jack Daniels and Dr. Pepper. The guys all had their whiskeys.

Sophia and I stood at the balcony, sipping our drinks and watching the sea of bodies below. Then, warm hands settled on my hips.

"Ready to dance?" Liam murmured in my ear, his breath tickling my skin.

###Chapter 0006

"Hell yes!" Sophia squealed, grabbing Nathan's hand. Grayson and Victoria trailed behind us, his arm draped possessively around her waist.

The moment we hit the dance floor, Liam's hands found my hips, pulling me flush against him. "Damn, Evelyn. I could just devour you right here," his voice growled through our mind-link.

I rested my head against his chest as we moved in perfect sync with the pulsing music. The electricity between us was undeniable, but we both knew crossing that line would only lead to heartbreak if we weren't truly mates.

"Maybe just a little nibble," I teased back. The heavy bass faded into Beyoncé's Single Ladies, sending all the guys scrambling off the dance floor while we girls belted out the lyrics.

Something made me glance up. There, on opposite sides of the club, stood Liam and Sebastian. Both were staring at me with identical intensity.

"Girl, what's the deal with Sebastian? He hasn't stopped watching you since he arrived!" Sophia whispered urgently.

"Who's Sebastian?" Victoria asked, leaning in.

"Alpha Benjamin's son," Sophia explained, subtly tilting her head toward him. Victoria, lacking any semblance of subtlety, turned and openly gawked.

"If I wasn't with Grayson, I'd climb that like a tree," Victoria declared, making me snort with laughter.

"Hey ladies, can I get you drinks?" A human male approached with his friends, radiating sleazy vibes.

"No thanks, we're good."

"Aw come on!" He grabbed my shoulders with sweaty palms, attempting some pathetic seductive move.

I slapped his hands away sharply. "I said no." With a meaningful look at my friends, I led them toward the back exit.

"I said—" The creep grabbed me again, slamming me against the wall.

"Problem here?" A bouncer materialized beside us.

Without hesitation, I drove my knee upward with perfect precision. "Would you mind taking out the trash?"

"Right away, ma'am," the bouncer nodded, hauling the two cursing men toward the exit.

"You ladies okay?" Oliver appeared suddenly, nearly giving me a heart attack. Though his words included everyone, his gaze locked onto Sophia.

"Perfect now that you're here," Sophia melted into his embrace as his arms encircled her. His earlier words echoed in my mind - if she was his mate, things were about to get very interesting.

"What's happening?" Grayson and Sebastian approached together. Both took in Oliver and Sophia's intimate moment with raised eyebrows.

"Not sure about them, but I just took out some garbage," Victoria slid under Grayson's arm.

"She basically neutered the guy," Victoria laughed while I rolled my eyes.

"You alright?" Sebastian asked, his voice low.

"Yeah, but I need another drink."

"You're welcome to join us," Grayson offered Sebastian.

"Thanks, though I doubt I could pry him away regardless," Sebastian grabbed Oliver's arm, pulling him along as I took Sophia's hand, leading our group back inside.

Liam and Nathan were nowhere to be seen. "What's everyone drinking?"

"Double whiskey, neat," Sebastian answered for both men. Sophia and Oliver claimed the opposite bench while Victoria and Grayson took the far end of the U-shaped booth. I found myself sandwiched between Sebastian on my right and...

"There you are! We've been looking everywhere," Liam slid in on my left, followed by Nathan with some girl in tow. Now I was truly trapped between two dominant males.

"This is Candy," Nathan announced awkwardly. The name might as well have been "Stripper" given her outfit. Silence descended over our group.

"How'd you find us?" I asked Sebastian.

"Right place, right time."

"Something happen?" Liam's protective instincts flared.

"Nothing major. Just took out some trash."

"Damn," Liam leaned back, taking a long pull from his drink.

"SOPHIA!" I yelled suddenly.

"What?" She jumped, snapping back to reality.

###Chapter 0007

"What is Sophia short for?" Oliver asked, his fingers tracing the curve of her jaw.

"Sophia."

"Lovely name," he murmured, his voice low and intimate.

I leaned toward Sebastian. "Is he always this intense?"

"Not usually. He's acting strange tonight."

"Do you think they're mates?"

"We'll find out soon enough." Sebastian tapped his watch. Fifteen minutes left.

"Let's dance!" Victoria squealed, tugging Nathan to his feet.

"Liam!" Nathan shot me a questioning look, but I shook my head. With a frown, he followed Victoria onto the dance floor.

"Not in the mood to dance?" Grayson asked me.

"I am, but I want to see how this plays out," I said, nodding toward Oliver and Sophia.

"Same!" Victoria bounced in her seat. "What if they're mates? We'll know any second!"

Sebastian and I both sensed Grayson's unease. He tugged at his collar. Sebastian leaned in. "Does he not want her as a mate?"

"She's not exactly Luna material," Sebastian muttered.

"Miss Evelyn, sorry to interrupt, but we have a problem," a nervous bartender whispered to me.

"What's wrong?"

"The tap system—it's malfunctioning."

"Damn. Give me a minute, I'll fix it." She exhaled in relief and hurried off.

"Is there anything you can't do?" Sebastian raised an eyebrow.

"Kill a mockingbird."

"Are you ever serious?" He scowled.

"Sometimes." Plucking the cherry from my drink, I bit down seductively, pulling the stem free with my teeth.

A deep, possessive growl shattered the moment as Oliver locked eyes with Sophia. "Mate."

"Mate," she whispered before their lips met. The tension was electric, but they managed to restrain themselves.

"Well, that settles that," I said, sliding out of the booth.

"Where are you going?" Grayson demanded.

"To fix the bar?" I blinked at him.

"I'll come with you," Grayson sighed.

"No! I want to dance!" Victoria whined.

Grayson's expression darkened. "I'll go with her. You have my word—I'll keep her safe," Sebastian interjected, diffusing the tension.

"I don't need a babysitter," I muttered, storming off.

"Which kind of saving are we talking about?" Sebastian's voice curled around my ear, sending shivers down my spine.

His husky tone made my pulse race. "All kinds."

"Seems to me you might need at least one. Or is my nose lying?" His gaze flicked to my lips, a wicked glint in his eyes.

"I—" My breath hitched as my body swayed toward his.

"Sebastian! There you are!" Isabella's voice sliced through the moment. I jerked back just as she rounded the bar, flinging herself into his arms.

His eyes locked onto mine as she kissed him.

I didn’t know why it stung so much—but it did.

Forcing a deep breath, I turned my attention to the tap.

"Here. We replaced the keg, but it's still not working."

I checked the back and realized they hadn’t reset the system. "You have to power it off, hook it up, then restart it." I demonstrated before testing the tap.

"Oh my god, thank you!" the bartender gushed.

"Anytime."

Truthfully, I wanted to leave—but I wouldn’t abandon Sophia. I'd stay until she was ready.

Sebastian's gaze burned into my back as Isabella clung to him.

I ignored it.

Or at least, I tried to.

###Chapter 0008

"No, I'm taking her to her brother. You should go join your friends."

"What? You're choosing her over me?" Isabella's face twisted in disgust as she glared at me.

"I'm not choosing anyone. I'm keeping my promise to her brother. This is exactly why we'll never be together." The hurt flashed in her eyes before she turned and ran off, tears streaming down her face.

"Am I the one causing drama now?" I teased, then added more seriously, "You can go after her. I'm not an obligation."

Sebastian grabbed my wrist and pulled me into an empty conference room, slamming the door shut behind us. He pinned me against the wall, his body pressing firmly against mine.

"Tell me you don’t want this. Tell me to stop." His hand wrapped around my throat, tilting my head back as his fingers tangled in my hair. His other hand gripped my chin, his thumb forcing my lips apart.

I couldn’t speak—my desire was too strong, flooding his senses. His eyes darkened as my tongue flicked against his thumb. With a low growl, his lips crashed onto mine, kissing me hard, stealing my breath. Only when my lungs burned did he finally pull back.

"I shouldn’t have done that." He stepped away, regret flashing across his face.

"Then forget it ever happened!" I snapped. Before he could react, I bolted from the room and straight into the nearest bathroom. Locking myself in a stall, I tried to steady my breathing.

Then I heard it—footsteps. The lock clicking. My instincts screamed danger.

"Grayson, girls' bathroom. Now," I whispered urgently as the stall door rattled.

"Hold on, Evie," he growled through the mind-link.

"Come out, you little bitch." Isabella’s voice dripped with venom. Two other girls flanked her.

I stood, flushed the toilet, and stepped out. "What do you want?"

"Stay away from Sebastian. He’s mine." She jabbed a finger into my chest.

"Step back, or I break it."

Three against one. I could take one down before the others jumped in.

She didn’t back down.

Fine.

My fist connected with her mouth before the other two lunged. I felt the crunch of at least one tooth before a punch slammed into my ribs.

I elbowed the second girl, shattering her nose. Two more hits to my side before I grabbed the third by the hair and smashed her face into the sink.

The door exploded off its hinges as Grayson and Sebastian stormed in. Sebastian seized two by their throats and hurled them into the hallway. Grayson wrapped his hand around Isabella’s neck, lifting her off the ground as I struggled to catch my breath.

"What the hell is going on?" Sebastian roared, his voice shaking the walls. The girls trembled in terror.

"You came to my territory to attack my sister?" Grayson’s tone was lethally calm.

Sebastian turned to me, his gaze scanning my injuries. I was still on the floor, ribs aching. He cupped my face, but I jerked away, staggering to my feet. Sophia rushed to my side, steadying me.

"Evelyn?" Grayson’s voice snapped my attention back. Rage burned through me. Bruised ribs, but nothing worse. Isabella was barely conscious.

I stepped forward, grabbed her finger, and snapped it backward.

"We settle this in the ring. I challenge you."

Her face paled. She could only flail weakly.

"Oliver. Bring the car around," Sebastian ordered.

"Grayson, Evelyn—my apologies for my pack’s behavior. Their punishment is yours to decide. I hope this doesn’t affect our alliance." He glanced at Sophia and Oliver—mates, and the reason this alliance mattered.

###Chapter 0009

Sebastian wasn't the same man I'd seen earlier. His dark aura made me want to shrink into the shadows. He emerged from the bathroom with predatory grace.

"Meet at Alpha Benjamin's office tomorrow with Alpha Grayson. We'll finalize the details then," Nathan stated firmly.

"We'll be there," Oliver replied, his gaze lingering on Isabella. "Your cells or ours?"

"Ours," I answered for Grayson. Oliver studied me for a heartbeat before nodding.

"Nooo!" Isabella wailed. Suddenly Oliver appeared, grabbing both girls roughly and dragging them toward his vehicle.

"I'll drive the SUV," Liam announced, stepping from the shadows.

"Scarlett," Grayson said with a nod in my direction. After assessing my injuries, Liam approached carefully and scooped me up in his arms.

I bit down on his shoulder to stifle a cry of pain. He stood motionless, allowing me time to adjust and the sharpest pain to subside. When I finally released my teeth, I rested my head against his solid chest.

"Jerk," I muttered as Liam carried me to the waiting vehicle.

"Um, Scarlett?" Sophia looked nervously between us and Oliver.

Lifting my head slightly, I reassured her, "It's fine. Go with them and return for the meeting tomorrow."

"Are you sure you're okay?" Her eyes shimmered with unshed tears.

"I've survived worse," I offered a weak smile. She pressed a gentle kiss to my cheek before joining Oliver.

As we drove away, Liam kept me cradled on his lap while Nathan maintained a firm grip on Isabella. Upon reaching home, Nathan immediately took her to the holding cells while Liam brought me to the medical center where Dr. Hett and my father waited.

"Grayson. What happened?" Father demanded as the doctor prepared the x-ray machine.

"Three girls ambushed her. One's in our cells. Alpha Benjamin will discuss punishment. Also, Evelyn challenged one to a fight. And Sophia is mated to their future Beta Oliver."

"This complicates things," Father murmured.

"Two fractured ribs, but otherwise stable," Dr. Hett announced. "No realignment needed - should heal within 48 hours."

"Thank you, Doctor," Grayson said. Liam lifted me again and we headed to the pack house, just next door.

He carried me to my room and set me down carefully. "Thanks. I can manage from here," I said, moving toward the door.

Liam remained silent, giving me an unreadable look before departing. Grayson had left my phone and ID on the nightstand. All I needed was to undress and collapse into bed - which I did immediately.

Just as sleep claimed me, my phone buzzed. A text notification glowed in the dark.

Unknown: It's Sebastian. I'm sorry about tonight.

Me: Which part exactly? (I saved his contact.)

Sebastian: All of it. I don't regret the kiss, but I shouldn't have initiated it.

Me: Oh?

Sebastian: Couldn't resist. You were irresistible.

Me: How many girls have heard that line?

His delayed response lulled me to sleep.

Morning light revealed one unread message:

Sebastian: Too many. But you're the first I genuinely regret hurting.

Ignoring it, I struggled through my shower. Saturday meant a full day at the parlor, so I grabbed comfortable clothes. Attempting to style my hair proved impossible with my injured ribs. Damn. Maybe Sophia could help when she arrived, depending on her schedule. I could use an extra pair of hands today.

"Sis, they're here," Grayson mind-linked me.

"Coming." I made my way to Father's office where the door stood ajar - and to my irritation, Margaret sat working at her desk.

"How are you feeling?" Father asked as I entered.

"Furious."

"Good," Father nodded approvingly. Margaret remained silent, merely shaking her head. I took a seat across from him.

We didn't wait long before hearing approaching footsteps.

###Chapter 0010

"Alpha Alexander." Alpha Benjamin greeted as he entered the room. I attempted to rise, but his firm hand on my shoulder stopped me. "Stay seated. How are you feeling?"

"She's fine." Margaret answered for me. Everyone turned, eyebrows raised at her interruption. The three girls shuffled in behind Sebastian, Oliver, and Sophia. Sophia immediately rushed to my side.

"How are you holding up?"

"Nothing I can't handle. Think you could braid my hair?"

"Of course." Sophia stood and began weaving my hair into a neat plait.

I studied the other girls—broken noses, missing teeth, blackened eyes. "Seems like three against one didn’t work out so well for you," Dad taunted.

"I’d like to formally apologize for their behavior," Alpha Benjamin said. "They’ll face whatever punishment you deem appropriate."

"My daughter has already issued a challenge to that one," Dad stated firmly.

"Foolish girl!" Margaret muttered under her breath.

"Perhaps you should check on the garden?" Dad suggested, nudging Margaret toward the door.

"The sooner you realize she’s worthless, the sooner we can be rid of her!" Margaret snapped before storming out. The words barely registered—I was numb to them by now. Sebastian and Benjamin exchanged glances, their pity almost tangible. I could practically hear their thoughts: No wonder you hit her.

"Let’s schedule the challenge for next Saturday?" Alpha Benjamin proposed.

"Perfect," I replied, locking eyes with my opponent. Fear flickered in her gaze, but fury burned brighter.

"Then there’s the matter of this young lady being mated to our future Beta."

"Ah, yes. Miss Hannah Rose Willis. Daughter of our finest warriors. She’ll be missed."

"Mind if we excuse the younger ones and discuss this privately?" Alpha Benjamin asked.

"Of course." We all rose and filed into the lobby.

"What’s your plan now?" I asked Sophia as Oliver and Grayson escorted the girls to the cells to await punishment.

"Not sure yet. Probably moving my things."

"Want to help me at the shop today? I can’t lift my arms."

"Absolutely!" She glanced at Sebastian for approval. He shook his head.

"You need to handle your move and the formalities. I’ll come with you and help."

Sophia’s face brightened. "That’s so sweet of you."

My eyes narrowed. "Sweet? Or did your dad assign you to babysit me and prevent this from escalating?"

His silence was answer enough. "Thought so. I don’t need your help." I stood and headed for my car.

"Scarlett!" Sophia called after me.

"Love you!" I shouted back, making it clear my frustration wasn’t directed at her.

"Nope. My car, princess." Sebastian held open the door to his obnoxiously flashy sports car—no doubt a magnet for shallow admirers.

"Why do they call you Scarlett?"

"Because my heart’s as cold as ice." A skill honed through necessity. "Grayson’s the charming, warm, social butterfly. Me? I’m the ice queen—ruthless, unshakable, and notorious for tolerating zero nonsense."

"So I’ve heard."

"Exactly. So don’t worry—nothing you do will faze me. This arrangement changes nothing. You owe me nothing. No wars, no obligations. Go back to your life, your choices, your company."

We pulled up to my shop. Fumbling with the lock, I stepped inside. Cleaning the bathroom and gathering trash was agony, but I managed. I sorted my sterilized tools and ink, piling them neatly. The ink bottles loomed just out of reach.

With a sigh, I called, "Sebastian?"

"Yes, princess?" He leaned against the doorway, arms crossed.

###Chapter 0011

"I need the ink."

"What colors?" Sebastian inquired, leaning against the counter.

"Black for each pile. The second set requires three." I watched as he gathered the supplies. "The fourth is a watercolor piece - pink, purple, blue, green and yellow. This last one needs red and orange."

"Four sessions today?" Sebastian raised an eyebrow.

"Yeah," I sighed, rubbing my temples. "All large pieces with clients who can't handle pain."

"My back's itching like crazy."

"Turn around and lift your shirt." Rolling my eyes, I grabbed the numbing cream. As I applied it, I caught his gaze in the mirror. "What?"

"Nothing."

I discarded the gloves and retreated to my desk. With stencils prepped and fifteen minutes to spare, I pulled out my sketchbook. Sebastian wandered over, eyeing my phoenix design.

"That's incredible."

"Thanks." He took the book, flipping through pages while I remembered to send spelling bee words to Grayson. A quick text later, the link was delivered.

The evening dragged. Sebastian hovered while my clients whimpered through their sessions. One guy actually rescheduled - typical male pain tolerance. I swear, warriors who could take bullet wounds became babies under a tattoo needle.

Sebastian alternated between watching me work and texting someone. Curiosity gnawed at me, but I bit my tongue - not my business.

When the last client left, I locked the door with relief. Finally. Twelve hours on my feet and I could collapse.

"Done?" Sebastian asked as I snapped on fresh gloves.

"Yeah, just cleanup and bookkeeping." I disposed of sharps properly, trashed the rest, and loaded the sterilizer. The familiar routine soothed me.

Sebastian observed silently as I worked. His sudden question froze me mid-motion: "Does Margaret hit you?"

Shit. He probably already knew. "Doesn't matter. I'm leaving soon."

"What do you mean?"

"At eighteen, I'm traveling until Grayson takes over. Then I'll return."

"Why doesn't Grayson stop her? Or your father?"

"Grayson's done more for me than anyone." I sank into my chair, exhaustion weighing my words. "He can't be everywhere. Besides, I can handle some bruises."

Sebastian approached my desk. "Where will you go?"

The question surprised me. "Anywhere but here."

"How will you tattoo?"

"I'll take a break."

"What about a mate?"

"Damn, you're nosy tonight." I rubbed my eyes.

"Just curious."

"When I find him, I'll let you know."

A knock interrupted us. Grayson stood at the door. Sebastian opened it.

"Sebastian." Grayson nodded as he entered.

"Grayson." Their greeting held unspoken tension.

"What's up, brother?"

"Checking in." He examined my paperwork. "Good month?"

"Very. Means I won't starve when I leave."

"Leave?" Sebastian's head snapped up.

Grayson's jaw tightened. "If it keeps her safe, I'll allow it."

"You'd really let her go?"

"Hell no," Grayson growled. "But I won't watch her get hurt anymore either."

###Chapter 0012

"I don't see why I have to wait until I'm eighteen. I'm already smarter than half the pack," I muttered, crossing my arms.

Grayson smirked. "I won't argue with that, but we had a deal."

"Whatever."

"Besides," he added, leaning against the desk, "Dad asked what we wanted for our eighteenth birthday. Sounds like he’s planning something big."

"Do I have to go?" The idea of a crowded celebration made my skin crawl.

"You do. And you’re wearing a dress."

"Then it’s not my birthday, is it?"

Sebastian tilted his head. "What would you want to do?"

I tapped my chin. "Hike up Blackthorn Peak. Or just lie on the beach. Maybe a private pool day. Something quiet."

"Why not tell your dad that?" Sebastian suggested.

"Because the second we turn eighteen, the pack expects us to find mates. Start full training—or in Grayson’s case, train his future Luna." My nose wrinkled.

Grayson sighed. "Dad probably assumes you’ll end up with Liam. Beta female status."

"Which is a demotion. I already do more work than Margaret does in a year."

"A big party means more chances to find a mate," Grayson pressed.

"And what’s a mate going to do for me? Even if it was Liam, I’d just be stuck here forever."

Grayson’s expression softened. "When I take over, no one will ever lay a hand on you again."

I scoffed. "Sorry, Sebastian. Pack drama probably isn’t your idea of fun conversation."

"Every pack has drama. I won’t repeat yours," he said easily.

"Found your mate yet?" Grayson asked him.

Sebastian shrugged. "Nope. Not rushing it."

"Right. The girl who attacked Evelyn was yours," Grayson said, irritation creeping into his voice.

"Was. After the scene she caused at the pizza place, I ended it." He said it like it meant nothing.

"I’m starving and exhausted. You two can stay and chat, but I need food."

Grayson checked his watch. "I promised Victoria I’d take her out. Just wanted to check on you first."

"Go enjoy your date. I’ll grab my car and get something."

"I’ve got time to drop you home—"

"I’ve got it," Sebastian cut in. "Already planned to."

Grayson hesitated, then nodded. "Text me when you’re home."

"Yes, sir," I drawled, rolling my eyes. He grinned, kissed my forehead, and left.

Sebastian glanced at his watch. "Ready when you are."

"If you’re in a hurry, I can walk."

"Nah, I’m good."

After finishing a few notes, I grabbed my bag. "Ready."

"Great. Let’s move." He practically herded me out the door.

"What’s the rush? Thought you didn’t have plans?"

"Just made some." He flashed a grin as the engine roared to life.

I rolled the window down, letting the warm night air rush over my face as we sped down the road. When he blew past the turn for the pack house, I frowned. "Uh, you missed it."

"No, I didn’t."

"Yes, you did. This isn’t the way home."

"We’re not going home."

"But your plans—?"

"My plans are with you."

"With me? Why?"

He smirked. "Got a curfew?"

"No…"

"Then what’s the problem? Do I make you nervous?"

"Please." I turned back to the window, hiding my smile. The stars blazed overhead, casting silver light over the trees. It was a perfect night.

When Sebastian turned onto the winding road leading to Moonview Point, I sat up. "Seriously?" My voice pitched higher than I’d admit.

He chuckled. "Never been?"

###Chapter 0013

"No way." It was a drive-in theater. You could order food and watch a movie under the stars. Tonight, Jurassic Park was playing.

"I hope you like loaded fries." Sebastian smirked at my reaction.

"I do." He found a parking spot near the back. We climbed onto the hood of his car, and he spread out a blanket to protect the paint. "I’m guessing you bring girls here all the time."

"You’d be the first. I usually come alone."

"Then why bring me?" His answer caught me off guard.

"I just wanted company." He shrugged.

Our food arrived as the movie started. The film was incredible.

The fries were crispy and smothered in cheese. I was so engrossed I didn’t notice the sauce dripping down my fingers until Sebastian handed me a napkin.

"Graceful," he teased.

"I aim to impress." I laughed, wiping my hands.

"Can I ask you something?"

"Sure." My attention was split between him and the T-Rex wreaking havoc on screen.

"What did you mean when you said you were smarter than everyone?"

"Exactly that. I am."

"What’s your IQ?"

"That’s classified. Reserved for my mate." I smirked. "It’s not a secret, but it kind of is."

"Hmm."

"Let’s just say I could’ve skipped high school and gone straight to college." I’d already said too much. "Why the sudden interest in me?"

"Just making conversation."

"My life isn’t that exciting. What you see is what you get." I shrugged. Maybe one day someone would care enough to dig deeper.

"Seems that way." Sebastian gave me a knowing look.



"Besides, if Isabella was your type, I’m the complete opposite. We can be friends, but I doubt I’m girly enough for you."

"I never said I was interested in you like that."

"No, you didn’t." Fine. If he wanted to play it that way… "Guess that kiss at the club was just a heat-of-the-moment thing."

"Something like that." His eyes stayed fixed on the screen. I didn’t push it, and we watched the rest in silence.

There was this weird tension between us. Call it chemistry, call it attraction—maybe it was because I hadn’t grown up around him. Sebastian had that quiet, mysterious aura, and damn, was it sexy. That kiss had been intense. I forced myself to focus on the movie, ignoring the heat creeping up my neck.

"Love this film." Sebastian slid off the hood and held out a hand to help me down. My ribs still ached, so I appreciated the gesture.

"Same. It’s a classic."

As we got back in the car, his phone buzzed. He checked it before starting the engine, his mood shifting instantly.

"Everything okay?" I asked as he slammed the door.

"Yeah." His tone was clipped. He peeled out of the lot, tires screeching.

I opened my mouth, then closed it, deciding silence was safer. We reached the packhouse in record time.

Sebastian leaned over and opened my door but didn’t get out. "Uh… thanks for dinner and the movie," I said awkwardly.

"Anytime." His jaw was tight. Confused, I stepped out, and before I could even shut the door, he sped off.

Weird.

It wasn’t late, but the house was quiet. I headed straight for my room.

"Scarlett?"

I jumped. "What the—?" Blinking, I saw Sophia perched on my bed.

"I came to hang out with you today."

"What about your mate?"

"I’ll meet him later. Sebastian was in a foul mood when he got home last night, and it carried over."

"When did he get home?" I asked.

###Chapter 0014

"Maybe around 11:30?" Sophia tried to recall, which wasn't far off from when he'd dropped me off. "Why?"

"No reason. Just curious why he was in such a foul mood."

"Who knows."

I stretched and sat up, yawning. "What do you want to do today?"

"Any tattoo appointments?" Sophia asked, bouncing slightly.

"This afternoon, yes. Nothing this morning."

"Perfect! Let's go shopping for a dress tonight—and one for your birthday party!" Her excitement was almost contagious.

"Oh joy," I deadpanned. "Can’t wait."

Testing my range of motion as I got out of bed, I winced. Better, but still tender. My phone buzzed, and I grabbed it on my way to the bathroom. Two messages lit up the screen.

Liam: Hey, how are you feeling today?

Sebastian: Sorry about last night.

Not ready to unpack that yet. My hair was a disaster, and my energy was low, so I twisted it into a messy bun, threw on joggers and a crop top, and called it good.

"Very attractive," Sophia said, giving me a once-over.

"I'm tired," I muttered, grabbing my purse as we headed out.

"I’m so excited!" she squealed.

In the lobby, Grayson, the guys, and Dad were gathered—until Margaret stepped out from the kitchen.

"Where do you think you’re going?" she snapped.

"Shopping for a birthday dress," I answered flatly.

Dad frowned. "There’s been an increase in rogue attacks. Maybe one of the guys should go with you."

"They’ll be fine," Margaret cut in, eyeing my outfit with distaste. "She needs something appropriate to wear."

Grayson shrugged. "I could tag along for a bit."

"We don’t need babysitters," I said, annoyed. "I’ve had the same training as them."

"Evelyn…" Margaret sneered my name. "Her new pack won’t be happy if she gets hurt under our watch."

I clenched my jaw. I really hate her.

"She’s not wrong," Grayson admitted, to my dismay. "Alpha Benjamin handled the situation with Isabella properly."

"Liam will go with them," Dad decided.

My stomach dropped. Space was what I needed—not him.

"Sure." Liam leaned against the doorframe, his gaze locking onto mine.

"Let’s go!" Sophia tugged me outside before I could protest.

"I’m driving," Liam said, sliding into his sports car. Sophia hopped into the back, leaving me the passenger seat. Fantastic.

"To the mall!"

Liam hit the gas. Sophia’s phone rang, leaving us in silence.

You didn’t answer my text, he mind-linked.

"Sorry, Sophia dragged me out of bed. I’m okay—still sore, but manageable."

You’ve been avoiding me. A statement, not a question.

"You’re overthinking it." I resisted the urge to bite my nails.

Stop lying. This started after Sebastian showed up. Is there something between you two? Annoyance laced his tone.

"No! Well—yes—no. It’s not him. It’s… I turn eighteen soon. What if we’re not mates? What if he thinks there’s something between us when there isn’t?"

How do you feel about me? His voice was unreadable.

"You’re a great friend. We had rules—no feelings. If one of us caught them, we were supposed to end it." I swallowed. Do you?

You know damn well I do. Anger simmered beneath the words.

Thankfully, Sophia hung up and saved me. "What kind of dress are you thinking?"

"Black tie until eleven, then the real party starts!" I forced a smile.

"Exactly. I want something black and sparkly." She traced a sweetheart neckline in the air.

"I just want to dance in it."

"Well, don’t go too wild, or Luna Margaret will lose it." She rolled her eyes. "But also… do it."

I smirked. "What if I showed up in scarlet red? Make a statement."

Her eyes widened. "That would make a statement."

We pulled into the mall parking lot. "Or white?"

"Save that for your Luna Ceremony."

"Ceremony? Grayson’s taking over, remember?"

We climbed out, Liam trailing behind. "I still think you’ll be mated to an alpha. Preferably Sebastian, so we can stay in the same pack!"

"Doubtful. Knowing my luck, I’ll be stuck here forever."

Liam held the door open, his expression dark.

"I’m sure your mate will love to travel!" Sophia backpedaled.

My eyes flicked to Liam. If we were mates, he couldn’t leave—but he’d promised he wouldn’t cage me. At least Margaret wouldn’t be able to lay a hand on me again.

###Chapter 0015

"Come on, let's try this one first!" Sophia squealed, pulling me excitedly into the boutique. The sign above read 'La Belle Époque'. We each grabbed three dresses from the racks. Sophia's choices were exactly what she'd described earlier—playful and flirty. Mine? Completely unexpected.

The first dress I tried was emerald green with delicate spaghetti straps and a plunging neckline. It hugged my waist before flowing straight down, the daring slit stopping mid-thigh. Stepping out of the dressing room, I turned before the full-length mirrors.

"Damn, that works," Liam commented from his chair near the fitting rooms.

"It's comfortable for dancing but doesn't highlight my curves," I mused, twisting to see the back.

"Not your style," Sophia scrunched her nose disapprovingly.

"Thank the moon! I wasn't feeling it either." Meanwhile, Sophia emerged in a strapless mermaid gown with a sweetheart neckline. The silhouette didn't quite suit her athletic frame. "That one's not working either."

"Yeah, it's wearing me instead of the other way around," Sophia agreed with a laugh.

Back in the dressing room, I slipped into my second choice—a black stunner with strategic cutouts. Thick crisscross straps lifted and supported my chest dramatically. The intricate back design featured intersecting straps that framed my bare skin, with daring cutouts along my ribs and lower back. The fitted skirt hugged every curve, the back dipping low enough to be scandalous, with a thigh-high slit that ruled out underwear. I felt powerful. Dangerous. Definitely not something Margaret would approve of.

Sophia emerged simultaneously in a black corset-style dress with dramatic pointed accents above each breast. The asymmetrical skirt gave it a Latin dance vibe.

"Holy hell! Buy that right now—party or no party!" Sophia froze mid-step, her eyes wide.

"Fuck me," Liam muttered, suddenly finding his shoes very interesting.

"That dress was made for you!" I told Sophia sincerely.

"Right? I could actually move in this." She did a playful spin.

Studying my reflection, I imagined the full effect—my curls pinned in a messy updo, crimson lips, strappy heels...

"One more to go!" Sophia clapped her hands excitedly.

Returning to the fitting room, I hesitated before the scarlet dress I'd been most curious about. The black one had surprised me—I'd definitely be taking it home regardless. This final option was fire-engine red, exactly what I'd envisioned. A lace corset pushed up my assets while cinching my waist, the transparent fabric revealing skin until the silk skirt began. The daring slit ran nearly to my hip.

Sophia beat me to the mirrors, looking ethereal in a slip dress with whisper-thin straps, the delicate fabric clinging to her toned frame. "Some fashion tape for the girls, and this is perfection."

"I know! I thought I wanted strapless, but these barely-there straps are everything." Joining her at the mirror, she finally noticed my outfit. "Sweet mother of—!"

"I know! It's sexy in a completely different way."

"They're both knockout sexy. Just... different flavors of temptation."

I understood exactly what she meant, though I couldn't decide which vibe suited me better. "Screw it. I'll get both and decide the night of."

Sophia bounced on her toes with excitement. "Can we please leave now?" Liam grumbled from his chair.

"Why so grumpy?" Sophia asked, only half paying attention.

"Nothing." My chest tightened—I knew exactly why he was irritated.

"Hungry?" She teased.

"Actually, yeah. Let's grab food and head out. I've got work."

"We should take it to go. Need to get back anyway."

"Perfect, I have that salon appointment." Maybe distance would improve his mood.

"Fine," Sophia sighed dramatically. "I could murder a salad."

"Same. Let's call in an order to Bella Cucina—I'll run in and grab it." Sophia's eyes sparkled with approval as she pulled out her phone.

I tuned out her order details. "Are you really going to stay in this mood all day?"

"What did you expect?"

"We never should've started this. I'm sorry." The words tasted like ash. I couldn't admit part of me hoped he wasn't my mate—that I might still escape this life. But the sinking feeling in my gut told another story.

As the car pulled up to the restaurant, I jumped out before Liam could protest. The blast of humid kitchen air hit me like a wall as I pushed through the doors.

"Table for one?" The hostess smiled.

"Actually, picking up—should be under Sophia?"

"Two kale Caesars?"

"That's us!" I exhaled in relief.

###Chapter 0016

The moment I slid back into the car, Liam's tension was palpable. His jaw clenched tighter than before. "What's wrong now?" I asked, already exhausted.

"It's Saturday! Club night!" Sophia glanced at me hesitantly. "That is, if you're feeling up for it."

"We'll see how the evening goes," I replied, stretching my sore ribs.

Liam's grip on the steering wheel turned his knuckles white. "You can't seriously be considering going out tonight?"

I rolled my eyes. "I've danced through worse. Remember when I broke my foot last winter? This is nothing compared to that."

Silence filled the car as Liam accelerated toward home. Sophia kept glancing between us but wisely stayed quiet.

When we pulled up to the packhouse, Liam stormed out without a word. Thank the Moon Goddess for Sophia - she grabbed my shopping bags and followed me to my room. "What's eating Liam?"

"Apparently he's caught feelings and can't handle the possibility we might not be mates," I sighed, collapsing onto my bed. "He wants me to cling to him regardless of what the Moon Goddess decides."

Sophia's eyes widened. "He actually said that?"

"Not in those exact words, but yeah." I unwrapped my salad with more force than necessary. "We had an agreement - no feelings. He broke it."

"We all saw it coming. How didn't you?"

"Maybe I chose not to see it." I stabbed my fork into the greens. "It was just supposed to be a distraction after... everything. And now I feel like shit for using him."

Sophia raised an eyebrow. "And what about Sebastian?"

"Please. That playboy only cares about Alpha training." I wasn't ready to share details about our kiss.

"Liam or Sebastian?" Sophia held up both hands like I should choose.

"Six more days until the Moon Goddess decides for me."

"Girl, don't forget - Friday's your epic birthday bash. Saturday's your fight. Then prom the following weekend."

"I'll wear the red dress to one and save the other for prom."

"Red would make one hell of a statement," Sophia grinned.

"Margaret will love that," I muttered, rolling my eyes as I finished my salad.

When Sophia was done eating, she jumped up. "Ready to roll?"

"Absolutely. I need to ride." The thought of wind through my hair lifted my spirits.

"You sure you can handle it with those ribs?"

"We're about to find out." I stood more carefully than Sophia had.

My mood was improving... until we reached the foyer. Margaret was berating a trembling maid who'd apparently missed a spot while vacuuming.

CRACK! Margaret's palm connected with the girl's face, sending her sprawling.

"Margaret!" The shout escaped before I could stop myself. I mind-linked Grayson immediately. "Foyer now. Margaret just hit one of the staff."

"On my way," came his instant reply.

"Well look who's here - the worthless daughter." Margaret turned her venom on me. "Done shirking your duties?"

"Back off, Margaret." Grayson burst through the front doors with Nathan and Oliver right behind him. His voice carried a dangerous edge as he positioned himself between us. Oliver pulled Sophia aside while Nathan moved to my side.

"This doesn't concern you," Margaret spat. "This brat needs to learn her place."

"You know the rules about staff," Grayson said with terrifying calm.

Margaret's lips curled. "Just wait. Your protection won't last forever." With that ominous threat, she stormed off.

"Is she always like that?" Oliver kept a protective arm around Sophia.

"Only with me," I sighed. "I look too much like our mother."

Nathan released me and stepped back. "Where are you ladies headed?"

"I've got tattoo appointments," I said, meeting Oliver's gaze. "Sophia's helping since raising my arms still hurts."

Oliver nodded. "We'll finish up here first."

"I want to hit the club tonight," Sophia announced, batting her eyelashes at Oliver.

###Chapter 0017

Sebastian studied Grayson. "I'll speak with Oliver and update you. The rogues are growing restless, especially after last night..."

"We don't have to dance. Just sit, have a drink, and unwind." Sophia gestured toward the door Margaret had exited through. She made it sound like I needed an escape. What she didn’t realize was that I was sneaking out regardless. Even if we didn’t go, I had plans for a midnight run. Honestly, it didn’t matter to me either way.

"I’ll talk to Oliver," Sebastian repeated.

"Need a ride, ladies?" Grayson asked.

"I want to ride." I shot him a grin. Grayson frowned but stayed silent. "Thanks." I stepped forward and wrapped my arms around him.

"Anytime," he murmured.

"Wear a helmet. I’ll stop by later." Oliver pressed a kiss to Sophia’s cheek before leaving.

"I will! Thanks for worrying!" I called after him, laughing as I strode out without waiting for a reaction. Sophia hurried after me.

"You know I adore you!" She linked her arm through mine as we headed toward the garage.

"I’m an extremely lovable person." Some might disagree, but I stood by it.

"Here." Sophia handed me my helmet before I mounted my bike. Once she secured hers, we revved our engines and took off. At first, my ribs protested, but I welcomed the pain. The wind in my hair felt so freeing that I nearly missed my turn.

"You good?" Sophia asked as we parked.

"I could use a five-hour ride." My tone was sarcastic, but I wasn’t joking.

"That sounds perfect!"

Unlocking the shop door, we stepped inside. The scent hit me—freedom, independence, pure happiness.

"I’ll grab the ink for you," Sophia called over her shoulder.

"Thanks!" I gathered the rest of my supplies, ready with thirty minutes to spare.

"Why is no one ever early?"



"It’s fine. I’ve got a list of things for you to handle while I work."

"Oh?" Sophia wasn’t my assistant, but I occasionally strong-armed her into it.

"Easy stuff. Confirm schedules with these people, email updates to these contacts, and balance the prom checkbook. Here are the last receipts."

"Girl..."

"Please?" I batted my lashes. "I’ll owe you one..."

"Oooh, an IOU? Perfect. I’ll cash it in when I need it."

Damn it. "Fine. I’ll regret this." My first client arrived, so I got to work while Sophia tackled the emails.

This client had a low pain tolerance, so we’d broken his tattoo into multiple sessions. Today was the finale—a wolf’s eyes reflecting in a blood-dripped sword, one of my original designs. The delicate shading had been meticulous, but the result was stunning.

"Let me clean it up, then you can take a look." I sprayed it down, gently wiping away excess ink. "Alright, I’ll grab my camera. Go admire your ink."

Sebastian and Oliver walked in. "Hey, gorgeous," Oliver leaned against the counter, making Sophia blush instantly. I rolled my eyes and fetched my camera.

"That’s impressive." Sebastian examined the fresh tattoo.

"Thanks. Evelyn’s a phenomenal artist."

"Appreciate it, Matt. You know the drill—we’re all done." I checked the photo, satisfied.

"Later!" Matt headed out.

"To what do I owe this pleasure?" I sighed, meeting Sebastian’s gaze.

###Chapter 0018

"You never replied to my message."

"Nope, sure didn't." I brushed past him, focusing on tidying up my station.

"How are you feeling?" Sebastian pressed, his voice tight with concern.

"Like a goddess on vacation."

"Dammit, Evelyn. Just answer me properly." His voice rose enough that Oliver and Sophia stopped their playful banter to glance our way.

"What do you want, Sebastian? I'm fine. Broken ribs aren't exactly new territory for me. I train as a warrior, remember? I'm not some fragile doll who needs a man to coddle her. You dropped me off and vanished. Maybe you're the one who owes an explanation." My irritation flared, and I scrubbed at my station with more force than necessary. A sharp twist sent pain shooting down my side, forcing me to grip the wall and breathe through it.

"Scarlett?" Sophia's voice was hesitant.

"I'm fine." Not wanting them to see the moisture in my eyes, I bolted for the bathroom. The sting was equal parts pain and frustration—my birthday stress and mate-search anxiety shortening my fuse.

I yanked open a drawer, grabbing two 500mg Tylenol. The cool water helped, and when I finally emerged, part of me hoped they'd be gone. No such luck.

"Maybe instead of the club, we could do a picnic in the woods?" Sophia suggested.

"With all the rogue attacks lately?" I doubted the guys would agree.

"I know a safe spot," Oliver chimed in, smirking. "Perfect for you ladies."

"Why don't you two just go enjoy some alone time? Sounds like a couple's thing."

"I don't want to ditch you," Sophia protested.

"You're not. I'm kicking you out." I flashed her a grin.

"Evelyn—"

"Seriously, go. Have fun. I'll finish up here."

"I didn't get much done," she admitted.

"More than I did. Now go. It's fine."

"Take the car," Sebastian muttered, tossing Oliver the keys. Oliver grabbed Sophia's hand, and they dashed off like kids set loose in a candy store.

"What's left to do?" Sebastian asked as I sank into my office chair.

"Just school paperwork. Balancing the books, that kind of thing."

"How much is left?"

"Since Sophia types at the speed of a sloth, most of it. But an hour should cover it."

"And the tattoos?" He checked his watch.

"Two small ones. Won't take long. You don't have to stay."

"Grayson asked me to stick around. Rogues are getting too close to town. Guess Liam was... unavailable."

My fingers froze over the keyboard for a heartbeat—long enough for Sebastian to notice. "I see."

"You wouldn’t know why he’s unavailable... would you?"

I exhaled sharply. "Just ask what you really want to ask." I was done with his fishing.

"Are you two involved?"

"Why do you care?"

"Answer the question first."

"We’re not. We had an agreement—no strings, just drunk make-outs. Nothing more. I’m saving the rest for my mate, and emotions complicate things. Plus, getting attached to Liam would be messy if we’re not mates."

"Especially since you want out," Sebastian finished.

"Yup." I popped the 'p' pointedly, refocusing on my work. "Turns out he caught feelings. Shocker, right?"

"I see."

"Happy now? Did that satisfy your curiosity about something that’s none of your business?"

###Chapter 0019

The door swung open before he could ask anything else, and my next client entered. "Hey there!"

"Hey, Charlotte! This is Future Alpha Sebastian. Charlotte is one of my pack members." Charlotte gave Sebastian a nervous glance but quickly showed him the proper respect. "Make yourself comfortable and feel free to use the restroom if needed. Let me just finish this email, and I'll be right with you."

"Perfect." Charlotte was stunning—long, toned legs, golden blonde hair, and nails sharp enough to rival a wolf's claws. She had the body of a runway model but the heart of an angel, and she was one of my most reliable assistants. "Do you need help with any of that? I’ve got the evening free."

"Actually, that would be amazing. I'll handle the finances if you can take care of these?" I handed her a stack of emails and call logs.

"I can multitask while you work." Since this was a thigh tattoo, her hands would be free anyway.

"Thanks, girl. You're a lifesaver." Sebastian settled into my office chair while Charlotte grabbed the phone and took a seat. The tattoo was on her outer thigh, so she lay on her side, her position unintentionally giving Sebastian a clear view of her chest as her backside faced me. To his credit, he immediately turned away, avoiding eye contact. A minute later, his phone buzzed, and he stepped outside.

He stayed on the call for the entire hour it took me to finish the intricate floral design Charlotte had chosen. The vibrant colors popped beautifully against her caramel skin.

We wrapped up at the same time. By the time Sebastian returned, I was crouched on the floor, snapping a photo of the fresh ink while Charlotte gave me a quick update.

"...The flowers and decorations will arrive on schedule. They didn’t have the exact shade of blue you wanted, so I switched it to a deep emerald green. It’ll still contrast well with the black and fit the theme. Might need some minor adjustments, so I changed the accents to gold. As for the carnival, everything’s running smoothly. All vendors are confirmed, and their deposits have cleared."

"You’re incredible." I tried to stand but winced, sharp pain shooting through my ribs. "Evelyn!"

"I’m fine." I held up a hand to stop her from panicking. My eyes were shut tight, but I heard Sebastian’s footsteps approaching. Then his arms slid around me, lifting me gently to my feet. Once he was sure I was steady, he released me and stepped back.

"Broken ribs," I explained to a wide-eyed Charlotte.

"Oh no! I could’ve rescheduled!"

"No, it only hurts when I twist. Besides, you’ve been a huge help today."



"Okay, well, I don’t have to write it down."

"Oh, you’re definitely writing it down," I said, sinking into a chair for a breather.

"Alright. I’ll head out unless you need anything else?" Charlotte asked after a few minutes.

"No, you’re good. Thanks for your help—it seriously saved me."

"Anytime! Bye!" She shot Sebastian a curious look before leaving.

"You trusted her with all that?" Sebastian studied me, skepticism in his gaze.

"She’s one of my assistants. Been with me for a year. Charlotte’s a rockstar."

"How many do you have?"

"Three. They’re more like part-time staff for the events I organize. I pay them a modest wage, but it’s great experience for their college applications. They’re all scholarship-bound, future Ivy Leaguers."

"How much influence do you actually have? This goes way beyond just being an Alpha’s daughter."

"I’ll make you a deal. If we’re mates, I’ll tell you everything. Until then, just think of me as a woman of mystery."

"More like a pain in the ass," Sebastian muttered.

"One of my many talents." I stood, cleaning up my station and prepping for my last appointment of the day.

"See?"

"So, I answered your question. Are you going to answer mine?" I pressed.

"You can add 'pushy' to your list of descriptors," Sebastian sighed.

"Just tell me why you’d even care."

###Chapter 0020

"To maintain peace between Grayson and the packs. We have to coexist, and your protection is part of that."

That hit a nerve. "Protection?"

"Yes."

"From what, exactly?"

"Everything."

"Like getting ambushed in the girls' bathroom?" It was a cheap shot, but he pissed me off first.

His eyes darkened. "Yeah."

He was saved when my last client walked in. A human kid—no more pack talk. Instead, a scowling Sebastian stormed out of the shop and stood outside.

My final client was Daniel. Barely eighteen, he wanted a cross with a sunset background for his sister, who had died in a car accident. I had finished everything but the coloring. I swear, men’s pain tolerance is a joke compared to women’s.

"This should be our last session," I told him with a smile.

"Good." The tattoo was on his chest, forcing me into uncomfortably close proximity with a human who thought he was God’s gift to women. "So, about that date—"

"No." I sighed. This was going to be a long hour. Thankfully, Sebastian stepped back inside. His posture was tense. Without a mind-link, I couldn’t ask what was wrong.

"Come on, just dinner!"

"Daniel, I said no." I pressed the needle a little harder than necessary, making him flinch.

"Ow!"

"Sorry." Sebastian glanced at me, and I swear his lip twitched.

"Watch it, woman!"

"I suggest you sit still and shut up unless you want to walk out with half a tattoo."

He grumbled under his breath, but I ignored him. Working quickly, I finished. "I’ll take a photo, and you’re done."

"Looks sick." Daniel flexed in the mirror.

"Thanks." I snapped the picture and turned to leave, but Daniel grabbed my wrist.

"We’re going out. Let’s go."

"I already said no. Leave." I yanked my hand free, but Daniel wasn’t taking no for an answer.

"I wasn’t asking." He grabbed me again, this time too tight.

Instinct took over. I spun and punched him square in the face—just as Sebastian lunged forward. White-hot pain shot through my knuckles, blurring my vision as Sebastian threw Daniel out and locked the door. Daniel pounded on the glass a few times before finally storming off. I leaned against the wall, steadying myself.

By the time my vision cleared, Sebastian had closed the blinds and flipped the neon "Open" sign off. "You okay?"

His touch was unexpectedly gentle as he took my hand.

"Could be better." I pulled away and sank into my chair.

"You deal with guys like him often?"

"Not usually. My reputation keeps most of them away."

"I see."

Standing, I moved to clean my station. Sebastian lingered by the door, watching. "I’m almost done. I’ll drive you home."

"I’m not in a hurry."

"Not ready to clock out?"

"Working?"

"Didn’t you just say I was just a job to you?"

Sebastian frowned. "Do you want to be more? Maybe we could have an arrangement."

I saw red. "Go to hell."

"How many guys have you had these arrangements with?"

"Jealous? Don’t pretend you care." I grabbed my things and stormed out, not caring if he followed. Unfortunately, he was fast—sliding into my car before I could lock him out. The ride home was silent.

Most of the pack was outside when we arrived.

"What’s wrong, Scarlett?" Grayson approached, glancing between me and Sebastian.

"Nothing." I shoved past them all and marched straight to my room, slamming the door behind me. I barely made it to the bed before collapsing.

###Chapter 0021

A gentle knock interrupted my thoughts before the door creaked open. "Evelyn, what's going on?" Grayson's concerned voice filled the room.

I groaned into my pillow. "Why does turning eighteen have to come with so much pressure? I don't want a mate. Mates mean emotions, and men are just overgrown toddlers."

I could hear Grayson suppressing a chuckle. "Did Sebastian make a move? I've noticed how he looks at you. No wonder Liam's so pissed."

"Liam knew the rules - no feelings. He broke that first. He has no right to be mad at me for sticking to our agreement." I sat up abruptly. "And Sebastian had the nerve to say I was just a job to him. Like I'm some assignment to check off his list."

Grayson flopped down beside me on the bed. "Who would've thought my twin would have boy troubles. For what it's worth, neither of them deserves you."

"What do you think will happen?" I didn't need to specify - we both knew I meant our upcoming birthday.

"We'll find our mates. For you, it could go one of two ways." His voice turned serious.

I quickly changed the subject. "Are you breaking up with Victoria before the party?"

"We've talked about it. I told her I'm going into the party single, and we'll see what happens."

"I bet she loved that," I said dryly.

"Not exactly." He rolled his eyes. "We agreed she'd go with her friends so it doesn't look like I dumped her. You and I will make our entrance together."

"Speaking of which, I can't decide between two dresses."

"Oh?"

"One's black, the other crimson red."

Grayson's eyes lit up. "Wear the red. Biggest 'screw you' to Margaret possible."

I grinned, turning to face him. "Glad we're on the same page."

"Don't tell her that though. Say you got a black one."

"Technically true. I'll save the black for prom."

"Ready for dinner?" Grayson asked, standing up.

"Do I have to?"

"You kind of do." He gave me that familiar 'suck it up' look.

"As much as I want to leave this place, I'll miss you," I admitted quietly.

"Let's just wait and see what happens? Promise you'll talk to me before doing anything drastic?"

"I promise." And I meant it. Grayson deserved that much.

"Good. Now change and come downstairs."

After he left, I dragged myself out of bed and studied my reflection. My braid, courtesy of Sophia, still held up decently. After minimal makeup, I slipped into dressy shorts and a deep V-neck blouse, finishing with strappy sandals before heading downstairs.

Margaret's shrill voice greeted me before I reached the bottom step. "Finally decided to grace us with your presence."

The dining room was fuller than usual - Alpha Benjamin, Sebastian, Oliver and Sophia had joined us. Liam sat beside Nathan while Grayson had saved me the seat between them.

"Margaret!" Dad's warning tone cut through the tension.

Pursing my lips, I took my seat silently.

"It's lovely to see you, Ms. Andrews." Alpha Benjamin offered me a warm smile.

Before I could respond, Margaret interjected. "Alpha Benjamin, how are things with the pack?"

My hands clenched under the table. Grayson's reassuring hand on my back kept me from snapping. I shot him a grateful half-smile.

"Everything's wonderful. Actually, I'd love to hear about this tattoo parlor of yours."

My head whipped toward Alpha Benjamin in surprise. As servers brought out the food, Dad gave me an encouraging nod. "Thank you for asking, sir. It's going better than I imagined. Art has always been my passion, and the shop lets me express that creatively."

"Oh yes!" Margaret cackled. "She used to draw on every wall and spill paint on my good carpets!"

Only Margaret's laughter echoed in the awkward silence. Dad simply shook his head in resignation.

###Chapter 0022

To my relief, Alpha Benjamin paid no attention to her. "That's truly impressive and something to be proud of. Sebastian mentioned you're also organizing the prom, the spelling bee, and several other events while taking advanced classes."

I glanced at Sebastian, his expression unreadable. "Yes, sir. I like keeping busy. Honestly, I wouldn’t know what to do with too much free time." I offered him a polite smile.

"I can think of a few things you could do..." Margaret muttered under her breath. Once again, everyone ignored her. The food had just been served—an open-faced roast beef sandwich with mashed potatoes that made my mouth water.

"I’ve heard rumors that you’re exceptionally intelligent. Is that true?" Ah, he was fishing for information.

"Thank you for your interest, but I’d prefer if you just asked me what you really want to know... sir."

"Evelyn! How dare you speak like that!" Margaret shot up from her seat, glaring at me.

Alpha Benjamin only laughed. "Calm down, Luna Margaret. She wasn’t being rude—just direct. Very well, I’d like to know your IQ."

"If you don’t mind, I’d rather not discuss that." My father spoke firmly. "I’ve allowed Evelyn to choose her own path. Yes, most of the rumors are true—she could have skipped ahead to college, but she chose to experience school like any other teenager. I’ve given her independence because she’s proven she can handle it. That’s all I’m willing to share unless she ends up mated to someone from your pack."

The room fell silent as I took small bites of the overly salted gravy. "I understand and respect that. I’d be protective of her too," Alpha Benjamin finally said.

The conversation dwindled, and I was left in peace. Grayson and Sophia were lost in their own world, their happiness almost painful to watch.

"I’m sorry," Liam whispered, leaning close.

"No worries." I gave him a small smile before sipping my wine. It was already past 9 PM—late for dinner, but early enough for a night out.

"Hey, Sophia," I mind-linked her. She hadn’t officially switched packs yet, so we could still communicate.

"What’s up?"

"I feel like dancing."

"Oh?"

"Well, at least getting a drink."

Sophia grinned at me before whispering something in Oliver’s ear. Whatever she said, he was immediately on board. Sebastian, catching on, leaned in to listen.

"Anything you kids want to share?" Alpha Benjamin raised an eyebrow.

"They want to go dancing," Sebastian shrugged.

"Try not to start a fight this time," Alpha Benjamin sighed.

"My kids aren’t going," Margaret declared, standing up.

"Excuse me?" Grayson was the first to speak. "Since when are we your kids?"

Oh, hell.

"Since I took over raising you ungrateful brats!"

"It’s fine. They can go," my father said without looking up from his plate.

"No! She still hasn’t been punished!" Margaret pointed at me accusingly.

Grayson pulled out my chair, helping me up. I was so stunned it took me a second to move on my own.

"I’ll keep an eye on her," Liam said, standing. Nathan followed suit, with Sebastian, Oliver, and Sophia right behind them.

"No time to change. Just get in the car," Grayson ordered, shoving us all toward the door.

"What a piece of work," Oliver muttered as Grayson peeled out of the driveway. I was in the front seat, forcing the guys to squeeze shoulder-to-shoulder in the back.

"Did you say you own the club?" Sebastian asked.

"Technically, the pack does, but yeah, we run it together," Grayson nodded toward us.

"It’s more his than mine. I just handle the logistics," Grayson admitted. He had the club; I had the tattoo shop.

"Is there anything you guys can’t do?" Oliver shook his head in disbelief.

I turned and flashed him a genuine smile.

"I can’t pee standing up."

"Smartass," Oliver muttered as Sophia burst into laughter.

###Chapter 0023

"Am I safe to joke around without getting my face rearranged?" Oliver asked cautiously.

"You're good. Since Sophia's practically my sister, that makes you my brother-in-law by default," I replied with a smirk.

"Does that mean I get access to your genius brain too?" Oliver's tone was playful yet held a hint of seriousness.

"Dream on!" I laughed, feeling the tension ease from my shoulders. Grayson reached over and gave my shoulder a reassuring squeeze. We shared a knowing look - our twin language at work.

"You two are something else. It's like you've got your own secret code," Oliver observed.

Nathan finally spoke up. "You have no idea how weird it gets."

"How so?" I turned to face him.

"It's like you can read each other's minds without the mate bond. One look and you just know what the other's thinking," Nathan crossed his arms, looking mildly annoyed.

"Jealous that Grayson and I have a stronger connection than you two?" I teased, giving him an exaggerated pout.

"Gross."

Our laughter filled the SUV as we pulled up to Moonhowl. Being early, the club wasn't crowded yet.

The bouncer nodded us through, and we headed straight for the VIP section. A waitress named Denise approached with a tray.

"What can I get you all tonight?"

"Jack Daniels, neat," I said, already anticipating the burn.

"Miller Lite," Nathan ordered.

"Vodka cranberry," Sophia chimed in.

"Whiskey," Grayson said simply.

"Make that three," Sebastian added absently, his attention elsewhere.

"Jim Beam and Sprite," Nathan added with his signature flirtatious grin, making Denise blush.

"Whatever's on tap," Liam muttered.

"Coming right up," Denise smiled before disappearing into the crowd.

"Hey Sebastian," Nathan never hesitated to ask the tough questions. "Why's Alpha Benjamin so interested in Scarlett's brains?"

"He was impressed by how she handles everything while still challenging Isabella head-on. Most girls in our pack don't have that kind of backbone."

"Ugh, all we've got are prissy girls who cry over broken nails," Oliver made a disgusted face.

"Can we not talk about me like I'm not here?" My tone came out sharper than intended. Nathan immediately ducked his head like a scolded puppy. My aura wasn't flaring, but the edge was definitely showing.

"Sorry, Scarlett," Nathan mumbled.

"It's fine," I said, though the irritation still laced my words.

"What's our schedule looking like these next few weeks?" Liam changed the subject smoothly.

"Birthday bash Friday, challenge Saturday, prom the following weekend, then the carnival after that," Grayson listed off.

"Spelling bee next Tuesday after school, but that's optional," I added.

"Did you submit your word list?" Liam asked.

"Approved and ready to go. Charlotte finished my to-do list, so just the checkbook remains."

"And that's all yours," Grayson smirked.

"Gee, thanks partner," I shot back sarcastically, but couldn't help smiling.

"Here you go!" Denise reappeared with our drinks.

"Better make that a double," I said after taking a long pull from my glass.

"You got it!" Denise swayed away, with Nathan practically twisting his neck to watch.

"Nathan, you're hopeless," Sophia giggled.

"What can I say? I'm a connoisseur of fine ladies!" Nathan cracked his knuckles dramatically as more people began filling the club.

While the guys debated fighting techniques, I slipped out of the booth and leaned against the balcony railing. The view gave me the whole club spread out below.

"Refill already?" Denise appeared just as I drained my glass.

"Perfect timing. Keep them coming." Werewolves don't get drunk easily, but we can maintain a nice buzz.

"You good, girl?" Sophia joined me at the railing.

"Never better. These drinks are going down smooth."

"Tell me about it!" Sophia started moving to the music.

"Grayson thinks I should wear the red dress," I shouted over the increasing volume.

###Chapter 0024


"That emerald dress looked stunning on you," Liam remarked as he joined our conversation. He maintained a respectful distance, but his presence alone made my heart flutter.

"Margaret is going to lose her mind when she finds out. I can't wait. Though, the prom decorations got switched last minute—they ran out of navy blue, so it's emerald green and gold now instead of silver."

"Your black gown will match perfectly then," Sophia squealed, clapping her hands.

"It will. You boys have your tuxes ready, right?"

"Yeah, we're all set. Pretty sure we even booked a limo," Liam confirmed with a smirk.

"Nice. Sophia, are you getting ready with me or at your pack?"

"Obviously with you. You're hopeless with hair and makeup. The real question is—your place or mine?"

"I could... attempt it..." I pulled a face that sent both Liam and Sophia into fits of laughter. The tension in my shoulders eased as I finally relaxed into the evening.

"Wanna dance?" Sophia nudged me.

"Nah, I'm good. You go ahead." My ribs had healed, but dancing still didn’t appeal to me.

"Fine, just checking." She was lying, but I let it slide.

"Oh, Liam, our bikes need servicing."

"Got it. I’ll handle it." Liam was always reliable like that.

"Thanks!"

"At this rate, I’m going to be your personal waitress!" Denise reappeared, balancing a tray of drinks.

"I’ll tip you extra!"

"Hold that thought. Our bartender called in sick." She shot me an apologetic look.

"Ooh, I’ll cover tonight!" The idea sounded thrilling. I turned and yelled to Grayson, "Bartender’s out. I’m taking over!"

"Damn it. Don’t pull another Coyote Ugly stunt!"

Sophia burst out laughing. "Coyote Ugly?" Oliver raised an eyebrow.

"She danced on the bar one night—"

"Hey, I made bank that night!" My defense fell on deaf ears as I followed Denise to the bar.

"Sorry about this," Kyle, our usual bartender, muttered.

"No worries!"

Fun didn’t even begin to describe the night. No one pestered me about my problems—just compliments and laughter. Kyle and I whipped up a storm of rainbow shots, and the crowd loved it. Every so often, I’d catch one of the guys watching me—Liam, Sebastian, or Grayson. Nathan would get distracted by some girl, and if I didn’t like her, I’d "accidentally" spill a drink on her. By last call, I hadn’t realized how late it was. Kyle handled the final orders while I cleaned up. Sebastian, apparently, was on guard duty tonight.

"Sebastian!" I called out.

"What’s up?"

"Can you change the tap? I can’t lift it right now."

He effortlessly swapped the keg, muscles flexing under his shirt. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t enjoy the view. Damn, he was hot.

"Thanks!" I grinned, resetting the machines.

"Need help with anything else?"

"Nope. We’re done." Walking out, Kyle was counting the night’s earnings.

"How’d we do?" Sebastian stood behind me, close enough that I could almost feel his hands on my hips.

"Great night. Though, when you’re here, it always is." Kyle shook his head.

"You good to close up?"

"Yeah. Here’s your cut." He slid a stack of bills toward me—at least a few hundred.

"Nope, split it evenly with the team. You guys earned it." I pushed the money back, and Kyle frowned.

"One day, I’ll make you take your tips."

"Good luck with that!" I laughed, waving as I spotted Grayson waiting by the door.

###Chapter 0025

"That was incredible!" I beamed at him, my grin stretching wide. Outside the window, the others were still chattering loudly, their voices blending into a chaotic hum.

"Damn, that was some impressive shooting!" Oliver shouted at me.

I turned to respond, but movement in the distance caught my eye—yellow eyes, wild and feral, sprinting straight for us. "GRAYSON!!! ROGUES!" The warning barely left my lips before the rogue crashed into the SUV. The impact was brutal, flipping the vehicle onto its side. The passenger side scraped against the ground before slamming into a tree.

Broken glass rained over me, tiny shards embedding into my skin. A sharp pain flared in my ribs, and something warm trickled down my temple. Adrenaline surged through me, sharpening my focus.

A rogue was clawing at the windshield, trying to rip it free. I kicked out, my boot connecting with its snout, sending it stumbling back. In an instant, my wolf surged forward, my body shifting into the sleek silver form of Luna. She was fierce, her instincts razor-sharp.

The rogues weren’t as mindless as I expected—no frothing mouths, just savage, calculated movements.

Some of the guys had already escaped the wreckage and were fighting. One rogue lunged at me, but Luna dodged effortlessly, pouncing onto its back. Her jaws clamped down on its shoulder, tearing flesh from bone. Blood coated her muzzle as the rogue howled in agony.

Just as she prepared to finish it, an enormous pitch-black wolf appeared, snapping the rogue’s neck in one clean motion. Luna bristled, unimpressed—almost tempted to nip at the intruder. But there was no time.

More rogues emerged from the trees. Sophia fought just as fiercely as the men, but Nathan’s woman—Isabella—looked petrified. Luna shoved her behind a tree, standing guard.

Grayson was handling two rogues with ease. Nathan was toying with his opponent, while Liam had already taken down his and was scanning for more. The other black wolf—Sebastian—moved with lethal precision. Luna couldn’t help but admire his form.

Oliver was assessing the situation, his gaze flicking between us.

Finally, the last rogue fell.

Grayson shifted back, retrieving a duffel bag from the wrecked SUV. He tossed me two shirts before distributing shorts. Sophia and I ducked behind a tree to shift back. The shirts were huge, covering the essentials, but I still felt exposed.

"You okay?" I asked Isabella, who was curled into a ball, trembling violently. Leaves clung to her face as if she were trying to disappear into the dirt.

"I-I think so," she stammered, her voice shaking.

"Come on." I helped her up, and Sophia and I guided her to the SUV, sitting her down.

"Shit, you alright?" Nathan rushed over, concern etched on his face.

"She’s going into shock," I muttered, frustrated that I couldn’t do more for her out here.

"Damn it."

"Injuries?" Grayson barked.

"Scarlett’s bleeding," Nathan said, eyeing me. I touched my temple, my fingers coming away sticky with blood.

"Shit, Scarlett, you’ve got glass everywhere," Liam said, stepping closer. His hands gripped my shoulders, tilting my head up to inspect the damage.

"There are tweezers in the first aid kit," Grayson called.

Sighing, I sat on an overturned log.

"No signal. I’ll run ahead for help. You guys good?" Grayson asked.

"Grayson, don’t go alone," I protested, fear coiling in my gut. There could be more rogues lurking. I pushed Liam away, turning to Grayson. His phone screen illuminated his face as he searched for reception.

"I’ll go too," Liam grumbled, reluctantly handing the first aid kit to Oliver. His gaze flicked to Sebastian.

Grayson and Liam took off running.

"I’ll do it," Sebastian sighed.

Sophia had been bitten on the ankle and was struggling to stand. Oliver looked torn between us, relief flashing across his face when Sebastian stepped in.

###Chapter 0026

"Sweetheart." I chuckled, watching Sophia struggle with her twisted ankle on the forest floor.

"Damn it, I know." She growled in frustration, throwing her hands up dramatically toward the night sky.

Sebastian cradled my chin gently as we balanced on the fallen log. My hands remained firmly planted to maintain modesty. With meticulous care, he plucked each shard of glass from my cheeks.

"Most of these will vanish by sunrise," I said casually, downplaying the injuries.

"How are your ribs?" He ignored my attempt at nonchalance completely.

"Surprisingly fine."

"Still riding the adrenaline high," Nathan muttered from his observation post nearby.

"Yeah," Sebastian agreed absently, his fingers now working along my collarbone beneath the torn fabric of my shirt. "Anywhere else?"

I peeked inside my shirt with one hand. "Don't think so." Like hell I'd tell him even if there were.

"Need help checking?" Nathan joked. His date smacked his arm playfully.

Our laughter echoed through the trees. "What? It's not like this disaster improved my chances," Nathan defended, keeping respectful distance from his indifferent companion.

"Dream on, Nathan. You've got zero chance with me." I shifted off the log, crossing my legs properly.

"You two seem so close. Are you mates?" Nathan's date studied Sebastian and me with curious eyes.

The question hung heavily in the air.

"My eighteenth birthday's Friday," I reminded her pointedly.

"Oh..."

"How far to the packhouse?" Sophia interjected smoothly. She knew the answer but expertly redirected the conversation. Bless her tactical mind.

"About ten miles. Still a trek." Oliver and Sebastian prowled the perimeter like sentinels. The hooting owls suggested the danger had passed.

With each passing minute, my adrenaline faded, leaving behind a symphony of aches. Every movement sent fresh waves of pain through my back. After several failed attempts to find comfort, I surrendered to the forest floor. The dirt proved marginally better than the unforgiving log.

"You alright?" Sebastian's voice pulled me from my thoughts. His fingers twitched with restrained concern.

"Just dreaming of a hot shower and my bed." I closed my eyes, lulled by the nocturnal chorus. Surrounded by my protectors, I drifted into exhausted slumber. At some point, Sophia curled against me for warmth.

Blinding headlights shocked me awake. "Evelyn!" My father's roar shook the treetops.

"I'm fine!" My yawn undermined the declaration.

"Your face..." Dad's calloused hands cradled my head with surprising gentleness as I struggled upright.

"Nearly healed already. Some soap and I'll be good as new." My attempt to stand faltered.

"Here." Dad lifted me effortlessly before Sophia took over as my crutch toward the waiting vehicle.

"Nathan, get the girls home. We'll handle the rest," Dad commanded.

"Yes, Alpha." The car's motion rocked us back to sleep instantly. We only stirred when tires crunched on packhouse gravel.

"Sophia, wake up." I nudged her as we stumbled to my bedroom.

The shower water ran brownish-red as we washed away the night's ordeal. Sebastian had done well - no glass remained, though the scrubbing stung. From my closet, I produced two silk pajama sets.

We collapsed into bed, asleep before our heads fully settled on the pillows.

Vaguely, I registered voices in my room before the door clicked shut. Whether Sophia remained beside me became an unsolved mystery - exhaustion rendered me incapable of investigation.

###Chapter 0027

My skin burned like I'd been thrown into a furnace. Beads of sweat trickled down my temples before sliding along my neck.

When I pried my eyes open, I found a warm body curled against mine. It took me a full minute of blinking to realize Oliver had left Sophia in my bed.

"Rise and shine."

I nearly jumped out of my skin at the unfamiliar voice. Sebastian lounged on my couch like some creepy stalker, the rumpled blanket and pillow proving he'd slept there. "What the actual hell, Sebastian?"

The door creaked open to reveal Nathan peeking in. "Coffee delivery?"

"Would someone explain why my room's become Grand Central Station?" My shouting startled Sophia awake. I suddenly became hyper-aware of how little my silk pajamas covered.

"Oliver crashed here because Sleeping Beauty wouldn't budge, then texted me for caffeine backup. I took the guest room." Nathan handed me a steaming mug.

Sophia stretched, claimed her coffee, and plopped beside Oliver like this was their morning routine. "She's basically a grizzly bear before noon. Give her thirty minutes to become human." Sophia groaned, rubbing her eyes.

"Noted." Nathan chuckled, settling into the armchair.

"Why..." I couldn't decide which violation of my personal space to address first.

"By the time we got back and debriefed, it was nearly dawn. Alpha said to stay put. I tried moving Sophia, but she death-gripped you like a koala." Oliver shrugged. "Hence the couch."

"Couldn't you have, I don't know, used another bedroom?" I yanked open my closet, ribs protesting slightly. The car crash soreness reminded me of an extreme CrossFit session.

"Couldn't leave my mate alone overnight. You'll get it when you find yours." Oliver's condescending tone made my eye twitch.

I yanked on a sports bra and shorts that suddenly felt two sizes too small, craving violence. After grabbing sneakers and pulling my hair into a savage ponytail, I glared at my uninvited guests. "Not all of us plan to be surgically attached to our mates."

"Sweetheart, you literally wrecked a car yesterday. Maybe take a sick day?" Sophia sipped her coffee with judgmental eyebrows.

"Says the warrior's daughter?" I tied my shoes with aggressive tugs, my foul mood worsening by the second.

"Someday I'll teach you that rest isn't just for the weak." Sophia sighed dramatically.

"Good luck with that!" I pecked her cheek before storming toward the door. "Be gone before I return." I aimed this at the boys.

Sophia's voice chased me down the hall: "Told you she's demonic before coffee."

I'd just reached the staircase when a voice stopped me cold. "Evelyn?"

Damn it. "Yes, Dad?" I turned to find him buried in paperwork in his study.

"What exactly are you doing?"

"Light workout. Work out the crash kinks."

"Don't overdo it." He returned to his documents.

Three steps later, a voice turned my blood to ice. "Put some damn clothes on, you little tramp!"

"Lovely to see you too, Margaret." My entire body locked up as she rounded the corner.

"You failed to submit the accounting reports yesterday."

"Deadline's today. They'll be on your desk by five." I tried to walk away but her talons dug into my arm.

"Unacceptable! I want them now!"

I wrenched free. "No. Five o'clock."

"How dare you speak to your Luna that way!"

Margaret's hand flew up, but a lethal growl from behind froze her mid-swing. "I wouldn't." Sebastian materialized at my back, his voice dripping with menace.

"You have no jurisdiction here! Your father will hear about this disrespect!" Margaret spat.

###Chapter 0028

"Please do." Margaret walked away, leaving Sebastian and me standing there. I couldn't bear the sympathy in his gaze, so I turned to leave as well.

"Thanks," I called over my shoulder with a sigh.

"Spend the day with me," Sebastian countered.

I kept walking, refusing to slow down.

"Do what?" I didn’t even glance back, forcing him to jog to catch up. He was still only in those shorts from last night, his bare chest practically begging for attention. If I stopped now, he’d definitely scent my arousal.

"Spend the day with me," he repeated, his voice firm.

I pushed open the gym door, relieved to find it empty. Heading straight for the treadmill, I started a warm-up.

"What’s your plan, and why me?" I asked between breaths.

Sebastian settled onto a nearby bench. "Just some errands. Could use the company—and a female perspective."

"Why not take someone from your pack? Take Sophia—she’s going to be your Beta female."

"You’re really going to pass up a chance to get out of here? Plus, we can take the bikes. It’s a bit of a ride."

That piqued my interest. When I glanced at him, he smirked, knowing he had me. I hopped off the treadmill, grabbed my gloves, and motioned for him to hold the punching bag.

"People might think you’re interested in me," I teased, landing a few sharp blows that forced him back a step. He’d underestimated me.

"I don’t care what people think," he grunted, sounding slightly winded. I bit back a smile.

"So, you’re asking me out of pity? A charity case?"

"Sure," Sebastian leaned in slightly. "You in for a little adventure?"

I didn’t answer, focusing on the bag until my arms burned. If we were riding, leg day was off the table.

"So?" Sebastian stepped back as I peeled off my gloves. My chest rose and fell with each breath, and his gaze flickered downward more than once.

"I need to balance the pack’s finances first."

Sebastian gave me that half-smile that made my stomach flip. Damn, I needed a cold shower. "And a shower. You reek," he joked—I think.

"Looks like you need more than a shower," I retorted, letting my eyes drift pointedly downward.

"I’ll go clean up and come back for you. We’ll grab lunch, then head out." He started toward the door.

"Take Oliver with you. Last thing I need is him claiming my room now that Sophia cleared her stuff out."

Sebastian actually laughed as he left.

I wrapped up my workout, showered quickly, and dressed with unusual care. The excitement buzzing under my skin was unfamiliar but not unwelcome.

Standing in front of my closet, I debated my outfit. It was scorching outside, but riding required protection. I settled on sleek black riding pants—lightweight but durable—paired with a fitted white tank tucked in. The chunky heels weren’t practical, but damn, they looked good.

As I headed out, I braced myself to ask my father.

"Dad?"

"Yeah?"

"Sebastian asked—"

"He already got my permission. You’re good to go. Have fun, ride safe." He waved me off before I could process it.

Sebastian had asked him first?

What the hell was happening?

I hurried to my room, relieved to find it empty. After a quick shower, I dressed, the anticipation coiling tighter. For the first time in weeks, I was looking forward to something.

And that terrified me.

###Chapter 0029

Feeling confident and alluring, I reached for my hair dryer. Sophia had been teaching me to use curling irons, but I still preferred my trusty rollers. After securing them in place, I applied minimal makeup - just a swipe of black eyeliner. That was my comfort zone.

My watch showed thirty minutes remaining. Perched at my desk, I attempted to work. The task wasn't difficult, but my distracted mind kept making mistakes. Three corrections later, I finally completed it.

"Sebastian's here." Alexander mind-linked me.

"One minute, I'll be right down. Is my motorcycle out front?"

"I parked it myself and did the safety check."

"Thanks Dad!"

I hit send on the financial report, then dashed to the bathroom to remove my rollers. I silently thanked the Moon Goddess for blessing me with perfect curls today. The bouncing waves looked even better than I'd hoped. Grabbing my lightweight riding jacket, I forced myself to walk calmly so no one would see my excitement.

Fortunately, Sebastian had dressed similarly - riding jeans with a simple tee. His leather jacket hung on his bike, but he already wore his riding gloves.

"Your helmet and gloves are inside." Alexander handed me my gear as I approached, smiling at them both.

"Where do you think you're going?" Margaret shrieked from the doorway.

"Riding." I replied casually as I stowed my jacket. Sebastian mounted his bike.

"Let her go, leave her be." Alexander warned.

"She hasn't submitted the financial report!"

"Just did. Check your inbox." I said, quickly swinging onto my bike. Finally, Alexander handed me my helmet. Tossing my curls back, I secured it in place. Sebastian passed me an earpiece for communication. Once settled, we were off. I spotted Nathan and Liam watching from the training field, but thankfully neither mind-linked me.

"You look stunning." Sebastian's voice came through the headset.

"Thanks. These are new riding pants - super breathable."

"They fit you perfectly."

"Lunch at Billy Dean's BBQ."

My stomach growled in agreement. BBQ was my weakness. "Perfect."

"Your father mentioned it's your favorite." Sebastian admitted.

"Wait - did you ask my dad for permission to take me out today and get restaurant recommendations?"

"Sort of. I asked if you could join my ride. I need to scout a potential venue location. He seemed happy to let you get some fresh air and suggested a few places. I think he knew you needed a fun day, and I happened to be available."

My heart sank slightly. "A pity invitation?"

"Not at all! I genuinely wanted to spend time with you. This just gave me an excuse to ask. I figured you'd say no to an official date. Besides, your birthday's next week, so no need to label this."

"Oh." The rest of the ride passed in comfortable silence, though it wasn't far. Sharing a parking space with our bikes, Sebastian dismounted first. By the time I removed my helmet, he was watching me intently. I'd just finished fluffing my hair and taking off my gloves when I noticed his gaze. "Need help wiping that drool?" I teased.

"In your dreams." He gave me that half-smile as I passed. I half-expected him to swat my backside, but he restrained himself. I couldn't decide whether to flirt or play it cool. The air conditioning provided glorious relief as we entered the restaurant.

###Chapter 0030

"Ms. Evelyn! It's been too long!" The hostess beamed as I stepped inside.

"Way too long," I chuckled.

"Right this way—I've got your usual table ready."

"Thanks, Gabriella!"

"Anytime!" She waved before disappearing into the crowd. I hated sitting with my back to the entrance, but Sebastian, being the Alpha he was, needed that seat. With a quiet sigh, I took my place across from him.

"Come here often?" Sebastian arched a brow at me.

"Now and then." He tried to hand me a menu, but I shook my head. "I know what I like."

"Alpha Sebastian! It's so good to see you again." A new waitress—Natalie—materialized beside him, her hand resting on his shoulder as if I didn't exist.

"Natalie." His tone was ice. He removed her hand with deliberate slowness. "Since when do you work here?"

"I just turned eighteen," she chirped, oblivious to his irritation. "Came to visit my grandma. They roped me into catering some spoiled Alpha twins' birthday bash next Friday. Apparently, I need to find my mate soon."

My eyebrow shot up. Oh, this was going to be fun. "Birthday party? I heard about that. Do you know who they are?" I leaned back, feigning casual interest.

Natalie finally noticed me. She nudged Sebastian aside and slid into the booth beside him. "No clue. Rumor says there are two of them—twins. The girl’s supposed to be some genius with a nasty attitude. The guy? Total heartthrob, ladies' man."

Sounds accurate. "Nasty attitude?"

"Yeah, apparently she beat up some girls in the bathroom. They caught her flirting with their man, and she lost it. Total psycho. Though, word is she’s ugly, so maybe it doesn’t matter. One of the girls even said she’s planning to cheat in the challenge."

That caught me off guard. "How do you cheat in a challenge?"

"Who knows? But if she does, she won’t last long. She’s got a target on her back now."

I glanced at Sebastian. His expression had darkened. Natalie, still clueless, prattled on. "Oh! And get this—she’s supposedly hooking up with the future Beta, but he’s been sneaking around with other girls behind her back!" She grinned like she’d just spilled the juiciest gossip.

First, I didn’t believe it. Second, I didn’t care.

"Fascinating. Where’d you hear all this?" I leaned in, playing along.

"Trade secret!" She giggled.

Gabriella reappeared, looking nervous. "Uh, Natalie?"

"What?" Natalie’s tone turned sharp.

"Do you realize who she is?"

"Just some nobody who doesn’t stand a chance now that I’m back in town." She shot me a saccharine smile.

I extended my hand, my own smile razor-sharp. "Hi. I’m Evelyn. The female twin. The one whose birthday is Friday. And since you’re clearly in Sebastian’s pack, I’m sure he’ll agree—you should report to Alpha Benjamin’s office first thing tomorrow. They’ll want a word with you."

Natalie’s face drained of color. After a stunned pause, she offered a trembling hand.

"I—I’m so sorry—"

"Save it. Honestly, I don’t care what you said. Most of it’s garbage anyway. But I would like to order."

"I’ll take over," Gabriella cut in quickly.

Natalie slunk away, head bowed. "Damn," Sebastian muttered under his breath.

"I’m so sorry, Evelyn!" Gabriella wrung her hands.

"Don’t worry. She actually gave us some useful intel."

"Your usual?" Her voice still shook.

"Yes, please. Tea with lemon today, though."

"Of course. And for you, Alpha Sebastian?"

"Brisket special. Water." His jaw was clenched.

Gabriella hurried off, presumably to the manager. I caught her planting her hands on her hips, glaring daggers at Natalie.

"You’ve got admirers everywhere," I muttered, crossing my arms.

Sebastian exhaled sharply. "That was a disaster."

"At least it was entertaining."

His gaze locked onto mine. "You’re not upset?"

I smirked. "Why would I be? She just handed us a lead."

His lips twitched. "You’re terrifying."

"Flattery will get you nowhere."

But the tension in his shoulders eased, and for the first time since we’d sat down, he almost smiled.

###Chapter 0031

"She was my girlfriend freshman year. Had a major attitude problem, caused so much drama her parents had to move her away."

Sebastian chuckled, shaking his head. "I can't keep fighting your exes for you. Anyone else I should know about?"

"Why aren't you more upset about what she said?" Evelyn studied him, noting the tension in his jaw.

"Honestly? The rumors about Grayson and me aren't exactly false. Plus, now we know Isabella is scheming. That gives us the upper hand."

"She's locked in the cells. She can't do anything."

Evelyn smirked. "Never underestimate a woman scorned."

Gabriella arrived with their drinks, balancing a small plate of appetizers. "These are new—spicy stuffed jalapeños. Let me know what you think!"

"Thanks!"

Evelyn picked one up, biting into it cautiously. The moment the heat hit her tongue, she gasped, juice dripping down her chin. The cheese stretched stubbornly, refusing to break.

Sebastian, meanwhile, groaned in satisfaction. "Damn, that's good."

"Nope!" Evelyn chugged half her iced tea, fanning her mouth. "I'm a total baby when it comes to spice. Mild is already too much for me!"

Sebastian laughed as she blew her nose, tears welling in her eyes. "Seriously?"

"Dead serious."

Gabriella glanced over, concerned. "Everything okay?"

"Perfect," Sebastian assured her, grabbing another pepper. "These are amazing."

Evelyn forced a smile, still recovering.

Once Gabriella left, Evelyn leaned forward. "So, where’s this property?"

"About an hour east."

"That’ll be a nice ride." She gazed out the window, already imagining the open road.

Sebastian took a sip of water, his eyes sharp over the rim of his glass. "Find any dresses when you went shopping?"

"Two, actually. One for my birthday, one for prom." Her grin turned mischievous.

Sebastian raised a brow. "Uh-oh. What’s that look for?"

"My birthday’s a black-tie event."

"And?"

"One dress is black. The other is scarlet red."

Sebastian’s lips twitched. "Let me guess—you’re wearing the red one."

"Grayson already approved. I’m making a statement."

"Good girl." The way he said it, low and approving, sent a shiver down her spine. She crossed her legs instinctively.

Their food arrived, the aroma mouthwatering. Evelyn skipped the bun, piling the pulled pork directly onto her plate.

Sebastian smirked. "No bun?"

"It always falls apart anyway."

"Fair." He took a bite, humming. "This is incredible."

"The best." She savored each bite, the fried okra crispy and perfect.

When Gabriella returned, Evelyn tried to insist on paying, but Gabriella waved her off. "It’s on the house. You’re a regular—enjoy!"

Sebastian left a generous $50 tip before they headed out.

Outside, Evelyn touched his arm. "Thank you for that."

"After dealing with Natalie? She deserves it." He slid his helmet on.

Evelyn followed suit, revving her bike. "Ready?"

"Yes, ma’am."

The ride was exhilarating—wind in her hair, the scent of blooming wildflowers thick in the air. She felt weightless, free.

Sebastian slowed, falling into pace beside her. "Enjoying yourself?"

"More than I have in ages."

"Good." He moved ahead again, but she caught him watching her in his mirror.

Eventually, he turned onto a gravel path, leading them to an open field. They parked, stripping off their gear.

Evelyn took a few steps forward, breath catching at the view—rolling hills, golden under the afternoon sun.

Sebastian stood beside her, silent, letting her take it all in.

For the first time in a long time, everything felt right.

###Chapter 0032

The summit offered a breathtaking panorama of the city we'd left behind. I was spellbound by the sheer perfection of the view—though I imagined it would be even more spectacular under the blanket of night.

"What do you think?" Sebastian's voice came from behind me, his presence warm and solid.

I inhaled deeply, stepping back just enough to press against him. "It's stunning. How did you find this place?"

"My family has owned this land for generations. We never had much use for it, but recently, there's been talk of turning it into an event space—something to generate revenue. My father sent me to survey the land and test the soil for contamination."

"How much do you own?" I asked, curiosity piqued.

Sebastian slid an arm around my waist and turned me slightly. "From about fifteen feet below us to several miles in every direction."

"Several miles?"

"Roughly five hundred acres."

"Damn." I took his offered hand as we began walking.

"There's a wooded area up ahead with a waterfall, if I remember correctly."

"Really?" We wove through the trees, the path narrowing until the sound of rushing water reached us.

"Hear that?" Sebastian murmured.

"I do." The breeze was refreshing, keeping the heat at bay. After another hundred yards, the trees parted to reveal a cascading waterfall feeding into a serene stream below. "Wow."

"Just as I remembered." He led me to a flat rock by the water's edge. I sat beside him, leaving only a sliver of space between us.

"When was the last time you were here?"

"Years ago. Elementary school, I think."

So no other girls had been brought here. "Why so long?"

"Never had a reason to come back, I suppose."

"If this were mine, I'd be here every day. Hell, I'd build a cabin right here." I laughed.

Sebastian chuckled. "It's no tropical paradise, but you're welcome anytime." His arm curled around me, pulling me close. My heart hammered—my mind protested, but my body leaned in. Resting my head on his shoulder, we stayed like that for a while.

Until curiosity got the better of me.

"Sebastian?"

"Yeah?"

I shifted to face him, and he turned with a questioning look. "Oliver had this... pull toward Sophia."

"He said he felt drawn to her."

"Sophia felt it too. Do you think we can sense our mates before we turn eighteen?"

Sebastian exhaled, gaze drifting to the water. "Maybe. I'm not sure."

"Do you feel that with anyone now?"

"You mean you?" He saw right through me.

"Or anyone else."

"I didn't bring anyone else here. Just you. As for your question... I don't know what Oliver felt exactly. What I do know is that I can't get you out of my head." His hand cradled my cheek, thumb brushing my skin. "I've never felt like this before. If that's the mate bond, then I don't know."

My heart fluttered. I'd hoped for a definitive yes, you're my mate, but his honesty was disarming.

"What I am sure of is that I look forward to seeing you every day. If you end up being my mate, I'll be the luckiest bastard alive. If not... I'll be crushed."

"Only because you'll never learn my real IQ," I teased, deflecting the swell of emotion.

"Do you always joke to avoid saying how you feel?" His hand dropped from my face, and I immediately missed its warmth.

###Chapter 0033

"I know. It's just...hard for me to be vulnerable." My voice trembled as I spoke. "I want to. I want to let you hold me, k*ss me. I want to believe you when you say everything will be alright. But what if Friday comes and you're not mine? What if you belong to someone else? Where does that leave me?"

Sebastian exhaled sharply, his jaw tightening before he turned away. His hands gripped his knees. "I'm sorry."

I stood, ready to walk away, but his fingers wrapped around my wrist, stopping me.

"Fck it." The words were rough, barely audible before he spun me around. His arm locked around my waist, yanking me against him. The other hand tangled in my hair, tilting my head back. Then his mouth crashed into mine, stealing my breath in the most desperate, consuming kss I'd ever experienced.

The second his l*ps met mine, I melted. My arms wound around his neck, my body molding to his. A soft whimper escaped me as my lashes fluttered shut.

I had never reacted this way to Liam. Never. And that tiny spark of hope flared brighter—maybe, just maybe, Sebastian was my mate.

His hands slid down, gripping my thighs, lifting me effortlessly. My legs instinctively wrapped around his waist as he pressed me against the rough bark of a tree.

When his mouth trailed to my neck, I knew I had to stop this. "W-we can't—we can't go further." But even as I said it, my fingers fisted in his hair, dragging his mouth back to mine. The scent of my arousal thickened the air between us, and I felt him—hard and insistent—against me.

God, I wanted this. But not like this. Not when we still didn’t know.

Our k*ss slowed, turning tender, before Sebastian finally set me down. One hand braced against the tree, the other resting possessively on my hip.

"I'm not sorry," he murmured, his voice rough. "I've never felt like this before."

"Me neither." My fingers traced his jaw. "I really hope you're mine."

Sebastian didn’t answer. Instead, he leaned in, brushing his l*ps against mine once, twice—soft, lingering touches that made my heart stutter.

"We should go," he finally said, though he made no move to pull away.

"Okay." But I didn’t step back. When I opened my eyes, his gaze was locked onto mine, intense and searching.

"You're breathtaking," he whispered, tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear. His expression was unreadable.

"What's wrong?"

His thumb traced my bottom lip. "If you're not my mate, Evelyn, I'll be damned. And I swear, I’ll challenge whoever is."

The words sent a thrill through me—equal parts exhilaration and fear. If I weren’t drowning in these emotions myself, I might’ve called it possessive. Dangerous.

A rustling in the undergrowth snapped us both to attention.

Sebastian’s grip tightened on my waist. "We need to move. Now."

Nodding, we turned and sprinted back toward our bikes. This wasn’t part of the plan. The clearing wasn’t far—just a mile—but every second counted.

"Get on. Go!" Sebastian urged as we reached the bikes.

"Grab your sample first!" The rogues hadn’t spotted us yet, but Sebastian’s tension was palpable. He snatched his gear, sprinting into the field about seventy-five yards before driving a soil sampler into the ground.

I yanked on my gloves and jacket, my pulse hammering. Then—leaves crunched nearby.

Sebastian heard it too. He abandoned the sampler mid-twist and bolted back toward me.

"Hurry!" I hissed, slamming my helmet on.

The first rogue broke through the trees just as Sebastian reached his bike. He shoved the soil sample into his pack, swinging onto the seat without bothering with his jacket or gloves. Only his helmet went on before he kicked the engine to life.

Our bikes roared to life as the rogues spotted us.

I nearly wiped out as we peeled away, but Sebastian’s hand shot out, steadying me without even looking. We hit the pavement, throttles wide open, not daring to glance back.

"Holy sh*t. You okay?" Sebastian’s voice crackled through the helmet comm.

"Yeah. You?"

"Yeah. That was…" He didn’t finish. He didn’t need to.

We both knew how close that had been.

###Chapter 0034

"Yeah…."

We rode in silence the rest of the way. The scenery was breathtaking, but my mind was torn—was I ready to be home, or did I dread it? With what we'd discovered, we needed to get back. Maybe even strike first. Eliminate the threat before they came for us.

Sebastian stuck to the main roads, occasionally glancing back to make sure I was still behind him. "You good?" he'd ask, voice tight with tension.

That was it.

"My turn's coming up," I said as the fork in the road approached. "Your dad’s probably waiting for you at Silvercrest about the rogues."

"I’ll make sure you get home safe."

"Seriously, go. I’ll be fine."

I heard the hesitation in his voice. "You sure?"

"I’m good. Thanks for today. See you at school!" I forced a cheerful tone as I slowed down to turn.

Sebastian didn’t linger. The second I veered off, his bike roared to life, tearing down the road like he’d been holding back for me.

Ten more miles and I was home. "Dad?" I called out as soon as I stepped inside, shedding my jacket and gloves.

"Training field. Back already?" His voice crackled through the pack link.

I didn’t answer. Instead, I bolted toward the practice grounds, half-running. "DAD!"

Nathaniel—my father—halted the drill instantly, every warrior turning to stare at me.

Grayson and Liam closed in as I spoke. "We were scouting the land. Found a wooded area near the stream. There was a group of rogues—fifteen, maybe twenty. They saw us."

Nathaniel’s face darkened. "That’s Benjamin’s territory. His call, but I’ll reach out. Did Sebastian go back to warn him?"

"Yeah. I told him not to follow me here. Wasting time could mean an attack. If they decide to strike first—"

"I’m calling." He pulled out his phone, showing me the screen before dialing.

The weight of the warriors’ stares pressed on me, but I ignored them.

Liam gripped my shoulder. "You okay?"

"Just worried they’ll attack. I’m fine."

"LISTEN UP!" Nathaniel barked. Instantly, the field fell silent. "Black team, move out!" He turned to Liam. "You’re in charge."

"Yes, Alpha," Liam answered, deadly serious.

Fifteen warriors surged forward, following Nathaniel and Grayson as they vanished into the trees—likely heading to reinforce Alpha Benjamin.

Liam’s gaze locked onto me, accusatory. "Anything else you want to add?"

"What’s that supposed to mean?"

"Just asking." His eyes narrowed. "I don’t like this."

He didn’t have to explain. I knew exactly what he meant.

"Sounds like a you problem," I shot back before turning on my heel and walking away.

The rogues were a threat, but responsibilities didn’t stop. I still had work to finish—events to plan, budgets to finalize.

Focusing was hard, but after hours of grinding, I wrapped up every project for the rest of the year. Thank the Moon Goddess I’d already handled most of it earlier in the week.

By the time I was ready for bed, a knock sounded at my door. The packhouse was soundproof, so I had to answer.

"Hey."

Nathaniel stood there, covered in dirt, sweat dried into his skin. "Just wanted to let you know—we stopped them. Met Benjamin right as the rogues hit the edge of town."

Relief crashed over me.

But the war wasn’t over yet.

###Chapter 0035

"I appreciate the heads-up," I murmured, holding my breath.

"Off to bed?"

"Yeah. School tomorrow."

"Big week coming up." Dad was clearly fishing for something.

"What is it, Dad?"

He rubbed the back of his neck. "Did you find a dress?"

"Two, actually. One for my birthday, one for prom." No point lying.

"Wear whatever makes you happy," he said after a pause, then turned and left.

"That was weird," I muttered, shutting my bedroom door. Flicking off the lights, I barely registered my phone buzzing before sleep dragged me under.

Monday mornings were hell. This one? Worse. I hadn’t even gotten out of bed, and I already knew today would be a disaster. Margaret would be in full frenzy mode—birthday prep, the challenge on Saturday. The pack house would be swarming with people all week. Tension would be thick, and I’d be her favorite punching bag.

Then there was Friday—the day I might find my mate. If it was Liam, there’d be no escape. We’d always had this effortless connection, like breathing.

Sebastian, though? A wild card. The hottest guy I’d ever seen, and damn, could he kiss. But the odds of him being my mate were slim. We clashed like fire and ice.

I grabbed my phone without moving much. Two messages—one from Liam, one from Sebastian.

Liam: Happy Birthday Week. Try not to let today suck.
Sent at 6:03 AM. It was now 6:45. I shot back a quick thanks before opening Sebastian’s.

Sebastian: Site’s cleared for construction. Appreciate the help.
Sent last night. No reply needed.

I dragged myself up, showered fast. Skipping school meant more Margaret, so I opted to go. Hair in a side braid, minimal makeup, basic shorts and tee. This week was going to be scorching.

I reached for my phone to text Sophia—then remembered she wasn’t here. I’d be riding to school alone.

"About time."

I nearly jumped out of my skin. Liam leaned against my doorframe, holding out a muffin and water.

"Jesus! What are you doing?"

"Bringing breakfast." He smirked. The chocolate smelled divine. I snatched it, glaring as we walked.

"What’s the occasion?"

"Sophia’s not here. Figured I’d step in." He shrugged.

"Thanks," I said, maybe too casually. He shot me a look.

"Want to take my car?" He hit the garage button.

"No. You’ve got training, and I need to hit the shop." I sighed, heading for my bike.

"Okay, but—"

"Liam." I stopped, turning. "You’ve never done this before."

"Margaret’s already on it. Grayson assigned one of us to escort you at the pack house until you find your mate." Always blunt, that one.

"Ah." I shoved the rest of the muffin into my bike’s compartment, helmet on.

We rode off, the morning air sharp against my skin.

###Chapter 0036

The ride to school was peaceful, the kind of morning that made you forget about all the drama. The crisp air was slowly warming up as the sun climbed higher. We arrived earlier than usual, so after parking our bikes, we settled on a picnic bench to finish our breakfast. The sunlight felt like a warm caress against my skin.

"Thanks for the muffin," I told Liam.

He smirked. "Figured you'd need it. I swiped it when the kitchen ladies were too busy yelling at someone else for stealing food before it was ready."

I took a bite, the sweetness bursting on my tongue. "Breaking rules tastes better, doesn't it?"

Liam's eyes sparkled with mischief. "So, are you wearing the red dress?"

I narrowed my eyes. "Did Grayson say something to Dad about that?"

His grin widened. "Why?"

"Because Dad mentioned it to me."

"Guess that means you're wearing it," he said, glancing over my shoulder. Sophia was walking up with Sebastian and Oliver.

"You're early!" Sophia gave me a quick side hug but didn’t sit down.

"Only because you weren’t there to make me late," I teased. It was usually me who held us up in the mornings.

She rolled her eyes. "Sure, blame me. See you at lunch." With a wave, she walked off, her hand entwined with Oliver’s. There was something different about her now—confidence, authority.

"You okay?" Liam asked, pulling my attention back.

More students were arriving, and I only had a few minutes before class. "I’m good, but I need to hit the library first. See you at lunch!"

I jumped up and headed toward the building, Liam trailing behind me the whole way.

The bell rang just as I hit print. I wasn’t worried—Mr. Ford was part of the extracurricular committee, and I was handing him a complete breakdown of every event left this year and next. Normally, I wouldn’t have this done until summer.

Not that I particularly enjoyed college-level economics, but it would look good on my applications.

As soon as I walked into class, Mr. Ford peered over his glasses. "Miss Evelyn, running late?"

"Just a little," I admitted, handing him the freshly printed papers. "But here’s the full schedule."

His eyes lit up. "Excellent work. Take your seat."

I scanned the room—my usual spot was taken by Isabella’s minions. The only seat left was next to Sebastian.

Fantastic.

"I see I’m not the only one taking advanced classes," I muttered as I slid into the chair.

His voice was low, amused. "These classes were designed to keep you here."

My body tensed. He wasn’t entirely wrong—the idea had been discussed before I arrived. Dad just gave it the final push.

"Partially true," I said, leaning back and crossing my arms.

The air between us was thick with tension. After our almost-date and that kiss, we were now sitting here like strangers—or worse, enemies. And the worst part? He was in nearly all my classes.

The second the bell rang, I was out of my seat and through the door before anyone could stop me. I’d skipped my locker earlier, so I needed to grab my books.

But as I turned the corner, a group of girls stood clustered outside my locker, laughing.

My stomach dropped. Only one person had the nerve to pull something like this.

"What’s going on?" Grayson appeared beside me.

"Haven’t figured it out yet," I sighed.

"Allow me." He stepped forward, growling. The girls scattered instantly.

Then I saw it.

Pictures of me dancing with Liam—and with Sebastian. Above them, scrawled in bold letters:

"Scarlet Ice Princess: Playing the Field."

###Chapter 0037

Grayson tore the poster down violently before storming away. "Grayson!" My shout fell on deaf ears. My stomach twisted as I watched him wrench open a door and disappear inside.

"Sebastian! Outside! NOW!" I didn’t know how he sensed Sebastian’s presence, but that wasn’t important right now.

Grayson marched ahead, his back rigid with fury. Sebastian stepped into the hallway, his expression shifting between confusion and anger as his gaze flicked from me to Grayson’s retreating form. His silent glare demanded an explanation. I shook my head and followed Grayson outside.

Sebastian’s presence loomed behind me, heavy and unyielding. Only when we reached the open air did I finally exhale.

"Grayson? Care to explain?" Sebastian’s voice was tight, barely containing his own temper.

Grayson wasn’t holding back. "Explain this!" He slammed the poster against Sebastian’s chest with enough force to make him stumble back. Sebastian’s eyes darkened as he scanned the paper.

"Where was this?"

"ON HER F*CKING LOCKER!" Grayson’s roar rattled the windows.

"No one is going to do anything," I said, glancing between them.

"Scarlett, listen—" Grayson’s voice was still raised.

"Watch your tone," I snapped, glaring at him. He immediately cooled. "I’ll settle this in the ring on Saturday."

"That’s probably best," Sebastian muttered.

"Seriously?" Grayson shot him a furious look.

"Grayson, making a scene will only make things worse. Let me handle this my way."

"No, that’s the damn problem. You’re ruthless. You’ll hit them where it hurts, and then all hell will break loose." Grayson rolled his eyes.

Sebastian raised a brow at me. "Seriously?"

"Where do you think 'Scarlett' came from? I don’t play fair. You don’t want to piss me off. I’ve got my father’s temper." I shrugged. To me, it was simple. Others might disagree.

"That might be entertaining to watch," Sebastian smirked.

"Don’t encourage her!" Grayson looked like he was losing his patience.

"Fine. I’ll take the high road—for now. But if one more thing happens, all gloves are off." I locked eyes with both of them until they nodded in reluctant agreement.

"Well, we’ve got thirty minutes before class ends, then lunch," Sebastian checked his watch.

"I need to sign up for the SATs." I turned and headed back inside.

"Yeah," Grayson grumbled.

"Me too." Sebastian followed us toward the office.

The halls were eerily empty, amplifying every sound—including the hushed giggles of girls. Slipping off my shoes, I crept toward the noise. Isabella and her clique were putting up another poster.

I felt Sebastian move beside me. Instantly, I pressed a hand to his chest, stopping him. Shaking my head, I stepped forward silently.

There were a dozen ways I could handle this. Just as I was about to slam Isabella’s head into the locker, something glittery caught my eye—her journal, peeking out of her bag. Snatching it, I tucked it behind my back.

"Little crooked. Move the right side up," I said smoothly.

The girls shrieked, and the poster fluttered to the ground. A can of spray paint rolled to my feet. I picked it up, studying them with a cold smile.

"Well, if it isn’t the school’s favorite snake," Isabella sneered, stepping forward.

"The only reason you’re still breathing is because I don’t want excuses when I destroy you on Saturday. I’m going to enjoy teaching you a lesson." I uncapped the spray paint and dotted her stomach. "First punch here. Then here… and here."

"You bitch!" she screeched.

One of her lackeys lunged at me. A quick chop to her throat sent her crumpling to the floor.

"Anyone else?" I sprayed Xs over her eyes like a cartoon corpse.

"A-Alpha?" Isabella’s voice trembled as Grayson and Sebastian rounded the corner. "She attacked us!"

"Lying now?" Sebastian’s eyes were pitch-black, dangerously alluring. "See me in my office after school."

Isabella smirked, licking her lips. "Like old times." She gave him a slow once-over. "Yes, Alpha."

Her friends dragged their fallen comrade away. Grayson was already cleaning up the mess.

###Chapter 0038

"Why did you stop me?" My voice was laced with frustration.

Grayson just gave me that infuriatingly calm look of his. "Scarlett, come on."

I pulled out my sketchbook, flipping through the pages with restless fingers. "Yeah, whatever. See you later." I turned on my heel and headed toward the cafeteria, already buzzing with students. Tucking the sketchbook away, I joined the line.

Grayson walked in and took a seat beside Victoria. She looked thrilled, but there was something off in her expression. Just as I grabbed my tray, a hand tapped my shoulder.

"Hey, girl! Sit with us!" Sophia beamed, gesturing to their table where Sebastian had just settled.

I glanced at my usual spot—Liam was staring right at me.

"Maybe tomorrow. I'm not really hungry." I dumped my food and bolted outside before anyone could protest.

The wind whipped my hair across my face as I walked, half-hoping Sophia or Liam would follow. Instead, it was Grayson who caught up, gripping my shoulders and forcing me to face him.

"What's wrong? You never let petty drama get to you before."

"It's not them. Well, not entirely. It's everything. We turn eighteen in four days. For you, nothing changes. For me? Everything." The words burned on my tongue, but I swallowed them down.

"Talk to me," Grayson murmured, guiding me to a tree. He draped an arm over my shoulders, his warmth seeping into me. "What's really going on?"

"Why do you—" I started.

"Don't deflect. The truth."

I exhaled sharply. "Everything. What if Liam is my mate? I'll be stuck here. We promised—no feelings. If one of us caught them, it was over. He never told me, and now if we're not mates, he'll be devastated."

"What about Sebastian?" Grayson asked.

"What about him?" My pulse stuttered.

"Do you think he's your mate?"

The million-dollar question. "It's different. Liam has always been my protector, but Sebastian... he treats me like an equal. He doesn't know my past, so he lets me be me."

"That's not what I asked."

"Sebastian offers a fresh start—somewhere far from Margaret."

"Evelyn," Grayson sighed, "stop overthinking. Your head won't tell you who your mate is. Only your heart knows."

"Yeah," I muttered lamely.

"I see how Sebastian looks at you. Don't feel guilty for choosing your mate over a childhood friend."

"So you think Sebastian is my mate?" I smirked up at him.

"I think you shouldn't feel guilty if it's not Liam." He gave me a half-smile.

"Would you feel guilty if it's not Victoria?"

"A little. She's not Luna material, but I do care about her. Letting go won't be as hard for me." He didn't need to say more—I understood.

"I just want to disappear to the beach," I joked weakly.

"Maybe as a graduation gift," Grayson laughed as we stood.

"If I'd known that, I would've graduated years ago."

He chuckled. "See you later."

"You're not dragging me back to class?" I eyed the school.

"Nah, take the afternoon off." A grin spread across my face. Grayson leaned in and pressed a kiss to my forehead. "Just don't make me regret it and get into trouble."

"I'll go straight to my studio," I promised.

"Good." He turned back toward the school, and I headed to my studio, my spirits lighter.

I was so lost in thought that I barely noticed the world around me.

###Chapter 0039

The lock clicked open as I stepped into my dimly lit tattoo parlor. Flipping the switch, fluorescent lights buzzed to life, illuminating the familiar space. My fingers tightened around the leather-bound journal as I scanned its pages - just enough damning entries to keep that snobby socialite in line.

The photocopier hummed to life when the shop's bell jingled.

"Hello? We're closed!" My voice echoed through the empty studio.

Silence.

But I could feel it - that primal awareness crawling up my spine. Someone was here. Someone dangerous. "Grayson, get the pack to my shop now," I mind-linked my brother, keeping the connection wide open as I rounded the partition wall.

Three towering figures stood in my waiting area. Their very presence made the air feel heavier. Unlike Sebastian's controlled dominance, these men radiated raw, unchecked power. Each stood well over six and a half feet, muscles coiled beneath ink-covered skin.

The leader ran a tongue over his silver lip ring. "We heard this is where wolves get marked." His voice slithered through me like winter frost.

"Names first," I demanded, squaring my shoulders. My wolf bristled beneath my skin.

"Forgive my manners, little Luna." His smirk didn't reach his cold eyes. "Dominic Knight of the Nightshade Pack. These are my future beta Julian," - the brunette nodded - "and gamma Adrian." The blond bared his teeth in what might've been a smile.

My blood turned to ice. The Nightshade Pack didn't negotiate - they took.

"Goddamn it, Evelyn!" Grayson's mental shout nearly made me flinch. "Hold on!"

"Tattoo requests go through my booking system," I said evenly, subtly shifting toward the emergency button under my counter.

Dominic chuckled darkly. "Now why would the daughter of Alpha Alexander make us wait like common mutts?" His packmates exchanged predatory grins as they fanned out.

"This territory belongs to the Crimson Fang," I countered, fingers twitching toward the silver dagger in my boot. "Your presence here violates the Accords."

"Feisty." In three strides he was in my space, calloused fingers brushing my collarbone as he inhaled deeply. "I like that in a mate."

"Get your hands off my sister."

Grayson's growl shook the windows. I'd never been so relieved to see my twin's furious face - backed by Sebastian, Oliver, and Liam. Their combined power made the very walls vibrate.

Dominic merely smirked, finally stepping back. "Ah, the famous Grayson Andrews. We were just getting acquainted with your lovely sister here."

Sebastian moved like liquid shadow between us. "The Nightshade heir should know better than to trespass."

Dominic's eyes gleamed with challenge. "Sebastian Blackwood, is it? How... predictable." He turned that predatory gaze back to me. "We'll be seeing each other soon, little Luna. Count on it."

As the door swung shut behind them, my knees nearly buckled. Sebastian's hand found the small of my back, his touch the only thing keeping me upright. The game had just changed - and none of us were ready for what came next.

###Chapter 0040

"You were supposed to be overseas for another year," Grayson said bluntly.

"I came home early. Got an invitation to a birthday party?" Sebastian smirked, his gaze flickering toward me. I cursed Margaret in my head for sending them one.

"I heard you already found your mate," Oliver remarked.

"Unfortunately, she didn’t meet expectations. I’m in search of a replacement." His eyes locked onto me, a slow, deliberate grin spreading across his face. "Yup," he murmured, licking his lips as he raked his gaze over me.

"She’s not eighteen yet," Grayson snapped.

"Neither are you. Not until Friday, anyway." His smirk deepened. "I’ll be waiting to see who I’ll be challenging for her hand." With a final nod, the three men strode out of my shop, their sports car roaring to life before speeding away.

I stood frozen, my mind reeling. What the actual hell just happened? His words echoed in my skull—challenging for my hand.

"Evelyn!" Grayson gripped my shoulders, shaking me hard. The motion snapped me out of my daze, and I finally looked up at him.

My mouth opened, but no sound came out. My tongue felt like sandpaper, my nerves were shot, and exhaustion weighed me down. Grayson pulled me into a tight hug.

"When the hell did he get back?" Nathan growled, pacing like a caged animal.

"This is bad," Oliver agreed.

"Can you guys come over for a meeting?" Grayson asked Sebastian.

"Of course. We’ll be there in an hour." Sebastian’s eyes flicked to me. "You okay?"

All I could manage was a stiff nod. It seemed to satisfy him, and they left.

"We need to get home. Cancel your appointments," Grayson ordered, snatching my appointment book from the counter.

"I’ll do it at home." I had never wanted to return to the pack house so desperately.

Grayson nodded, grabbing my bag while I locked up. Nathan drove us back, dropping Liam off to ride my bike home. The entire trip took forty-five minutes, and by the time we arrived, my father was already waiting, his expression thunderous.

"Evelyn, go to my office. Make your calls and stay there." His voice was sharp with barely contained fury.

Nodding, I bolted upstairs before I could break down.

No. I’m not going to cry. I clenched my fists, forcing myself to focus. Opening my book, I dialed the first client.

"Hello?"

"Frank, this is Evelyn. I need to reschedule. Something urgent came up, and my father requires my presence." It wasn’t a lie.

"Damn, alright. Just let me know when you’re free." As a pack member, he couldn’t argue with an Alpha’s command.

"How about Thursday at four?"

"Sounds good. Thanks."

The next call went similarly, but the last one was a human—and far less understanding.

"Hello?" His tone was already irritated.

"This is Evelyn. I need to reschedule today’s appointment due to an emergency."

"That’s bullshit. I already paid, and I want my tattoo finished!"

Just then, my father and the others walked in—Sebastian, Benjamin, Oliver, and Sophia included.

"I understand your frustration, but this is unavoidable. Can we reschedule for next week?"

"I’ll call you back." Click.

Frowning, I set my phone down. Everyone was staring at me, waiting.

"Evelyn! Are you okay?" Sophia rushed to my side, her face etched with concern.

I just stared at her, unsure how to answer. My gaze shifted to Grayson, silently begging him to change the subject.

"Dad, why the hell was an invitation sent to them? They’re not allies!" Grayson snapped.

Sophia tried to wrap an arm around me, but I pushed her away and stood. If I let her comfort me, I might shatter.

"Margaret, get in here," my father barked into the intercom.

Silence filled the room as we waited. I moved to the window, staring blankly outside.

"Honey—" Margaret stepped in, freezing when she saw the crowd. "What’s going on?" Her voice turned wary.

###Chapter 0041

"Did you invite the Silvercrest Pack to the kids' party?" Dad asked, his voice low and measured.

"I did. It was the courteous thing to do," Margaret replied smoothly.

"How stupid could you be?" Grayson exploded, his fists clenching. "His son threatened Evelyn!"

"Don’t forget who you’re speaking to!" Margaret shrieked, her face twisting in outrage.

"Margaret!" Dad’s voice boomed through the room, silencing everyone. "This is serious. He threatened to challenge whoever is mated to Evelyn. This isn’t just some petty argument—it’s a goddamn declaration!"

Margaret scoffed, flipping her hair. "Who knows? Maybe he will be her mate. Besides, she’s been desperate to leave this place. Let her go with him. I hear he travels often. A strong mate might do her some good."

The room went deathly silent.

One moment, I was staring out the window, numb. The next—

I was standing in front of Margaret, my palm stinging from the force of the slap I’d just delivered. Blood trickled from her lip as she stumbled back, shock widening her eyes. Strong arms wrapped around me, yanking me away before I could strike again.

No one moved to help Margaret.

She scrambled to her feet, clutching her face, but Grayson stepped between us, his expression dark.

I wasn’t struggling against whoever held me, but my claws were out, my fangs bared. Ready.

"Margaret," Dad said coldly, still seated, "go to the infirmary. And I command you—not a word of this leaves this room."

She fled, sobbing.

Only when she was gone did Dad rise. He approached me, cupping my face in his hands. "Breathe," he ordered. "Calm down."

Behind me, Liam released his grip, stepping back. His golden eyes were slits, his gaze fixed on the ceiling like he was restraining himself.

Dad guided me into Margaret’s vacated seat.

"There’s nothing we can do now," he muttered.

"It’ll start a war," Alpha Benjamin said grimly. "We need to tread carefully. See what his next move is. The Silvercrest Pack is unpredictable."

"We’re stronger than them!" Oliver cracked his knuckles.

"We don’t want a war," Dad snapped. "So far, it’s just talk. He violated the treaty by entering your shop. I’ll call Alpha Damian and handle this."

"What about Evelyn’s safety?" Grayson demanded.

"She’s not going to school."

"Dad—no! She can’t—"

"I can," I cut in, my voice steady. The room froze. "And I will."

All eyes locked onto me.

"I’ll accept protection," I continued, "but I won’t let him dictate my life. I won’t cower in my room like some frightened pup. I’m an Alpha female—daughter of Alpha Alexander—and I refuse to be intimidated."

My words rang with conviction, even if my pulse betrayed me.

"Evelyn, think about this," Liam pleaded.

"I have," I snapped. "None of you understand what it’s like—to be a woman, to be reduced to something weak, something to be controlled. I won’t tolerate it. I won’t let him think he can touch me, threaten me, or own me." My fist slammed onto the desk, splitting the wood at the edge. "I’d rather die than let any man believe he’s above me."

Silence.

Then—

"If he threatens her, she stays home," Liam declared, as if he had any say.

Sebastian smirked. "I don’t think it’s her safety we need to worry about. It’s whether he survives her."

Liam’s chest puffed out, his jaw tightening. Sebastian rose, towering over him.

"Either way," Liam growled, "it’s none of your concern. Last I checked, she’s still part of this pack."

Sebastian’s grin turned razor-sharp. "For now."

###Chapter 0042

"That's enough, boys." Benjamin rose to his feet, stepping between them.

"She'll need a true Alpha to defend her against Dominic, not some second-rate wolf." Sebastian's words dripped with arrogance. Grayson lunged forward, but Nathan intercepted him before fists could fly.

"LIAM!" Alpha Alexander's voice cracked like thunder. "Go cool down!" Liam stormed out, slamming the door hard enough to rattle the windows. Nathan followed, but Grayson remained.

"That was uncalled for," Grayson growled at Sebastian.

"I'm stating facts. Only Alpha blood can defeat an Alpha. I'm her best chance."

"Assuming you're her mate," Alexander countered, reclining in his chair.

"Precisely, sir."

"And you truly believe you are?"

"I'll know for certain as the week progresses, but currently? Yes." Sebastian didn't even glance my way.

"This is your decision, Alexander. Regardless of mates, she's your daughter." Benjamin shrugged.

"I'll assign a warrior as her guard. Having you boys involved would be too volatile. One misstep, and you're grounded until Friday." My father's piercing gaze locked onto me.

"Fine." Better than nothing.

"You kids are dismissed. Benjamin and I need to call Damian." Father waved us away.

"Evelyn?" Sophia whispered, concern lacing her voice.

"I'm okay," I assured her, pulling her into a tight embrace. "Let's get some air."

Arm in arm, we stepped outside with the boys trailing behind. We settled on the porch swing while they leaned against the railing and walls.

"Beautiful day," Sophia remarked.

"How are things with you?" I asked, desperate to shift focus from my drama.

"Wonderful. Different. I'm learning my duties as future Beta female—who knew there were so many?"

"You'll excel at that. You've always been great with organization." I squeezed her hand.

"Thanks. Oliver's mother has been amazing, but I miss you terribly."

"I miss you too."

"Think I could come help you get ready Friday?"

"Please! I was worried about who'd do my hair and makeup." Relief flooded me.

"Oliver already approved. He and Sebastian will meet me here. I'll arrive early to sit with them during your entrance with Grayson."

"Not looking forward to that spectacle."

"Please tell me you're wearing the red dress?" Sophia's eyes sparkled with excitement.

"After today? You bet I am."

"Speak of the devil," Sebastian muttered, nodding toward the pathway. Margaret was being escorted back.

"Will you face consequences?" Sebastian asked.

"No," Grayson snapped.

"At least according to Dad," I added as Margaret emerged. The bruise on her chin had darkened, her lip split.

"Just wait, you little—" Margaret sneered before disappearing inside.

"Maybe Evelyn could stay with me?" Sophia suggested, glancing between Oliver and Sebastian.

"She's certainly welcome," Sebastian said diplomatically, "but that's Grayson and Alpha Alexander's decision."

"Perhaps I could stay Thursday night?" Sophia turned pleading eyes to Oliver.

His frown spoke volumes—he hated being apart from her. I bit back a laugh. "We'll find time when things calm down."

"Okay..." Sophia sighed, leaning back. "Remember when you made this dent?" She traced a familiar groove beneath the swing.

"Oh gods, yes!"

"Utterly ridiculous," Grayson groaned, shaking his head.

"What happened?" Oliver asked.

"Princess here was forced into some hideous dress by Margaret. We tried altering it, but she tripped on the hem and face-planted. Split her chin open."

"Truly the ugliest dress in existence."

The front door creaked open as Alexander and Benjamin emerged. "That didn't go well," Benjamin sighed.

"We'll need heightened security moving forward," Alexander said through gritted teeth.

"Margaret's back," Grayson noted.

"And furious."

"Is Evelyn safe here with Margaret around?" Grayson's question made my father pause.

"Why do you ask?"

"Perhaps she should stay with Sophia this week. Less risk of retaliation from Margaret, even if it doesn't shield her from Dominic."

###Chapter 0043

My jaw dropped. "Wh—"

"That would keep her close to Sebastian if he's her mate," Benjamin stated firmly.

"Mate or not, I'll die protecting what's right," Sebastian vowed, his voice unwavering.

"Please, Scarlett? Stay with me?" Everyone's eyes turned to me.

"I won't force you, but I believe this is for the best," Dad said, locking his gaze with mine.

"We'd be happy to have you," Benjamin offered with a warm smile.

"Guess I'll go pack," I muttered, my tone slightly sulky as I stood and headed inside. I expected Sophia to follow, but I doubted Grayson would let her. We reached my bedroom before he finally spoke.

"I'm sorry I can't protect you here."

"I know you are."

"Please use your manners."

"Obviously, Grayson." I yanked out my black duffel and started stuffing it with essentials for the week.

"You can leave your dress. Dad has a whole day planned for you."

"And you?"

"Yes, but a completely different kind of day." He smirked, leaning casually against the doorframe.

"Do you think Sebastian is my mate?" I asked while selecting my shoes, keeping it simple.

"Looks that way."

"And Liam?"

"Liam needs to move on. What Sebastian said about the fight was right—even if it was a low blow."

"I've been dealt a crappy hand since day one. Wouldn't surprise me if Nathan was my mate!"

"Ew, don't even say that." Grayson scrunched his face in disgust.

"That man-whore is going to catch something one day."

"True. But seriously, Dominic is bad news. He killed his own mate."

"Here's a thought—what if Sebastian isn't my mate?"

"Then at least you get a change of scenery for a week."

Grayson was trying to lighten the mood. "Maybe you can even help Sophia adjust. Sebastian mentioned it's not going well."

"What?" That caught me off guard. I paused packing and stared at him.

"Yeah, she's been forgetful. Sebastian thinks she's homesick."

"It's only been—"

"I know, but change isn't easy for everyone." Grayson stepped closer, placing his hands on my shoulders. His eyes met mine. "I really think this will be good for both you and Sophia. Try to have a decent week, okay?"

"For you, I will."

"Maybe something good will come out of this." He grabbed my bag and tugged me toward the door.

"You were always the optimistic one."

"And I'm usually right."

"Why aren't you more worried about your own mate?"

"I'm more worried about you. I'm nervous, sure, but I know my path in life."

"Damn firstborn," I joked weakly.

"I did get the better looks and body." I rolled my eyes as Grayson shook his hips playfully. At the front door, he handed my bag to Sebastian and pulled me into a tight hug.

"See you tomorrow at school, sis."

I hugged him back like it might be the last time. "I love you," I whispered through the mind-link.

"Can't say it out loud?" he teased as I turned to hug Dad.

"I have an image to uphold. Can't let people know I'm soft inside."

"Ready?" Alpha Benjamin asked.

"Yes, sir." Sebastian was already loading my bag into the trunk.

After one last glance at Dad and Grayson, Sophia grabbed my hand and tugged me forward. "Love you too," she mind-linked, squeezing my fingers reassuringly.

The car ride was quiet. Sophia sat in the middle with Oliver beside her, while Sebastian and Alpha Benjamin took the front seats.

"We usually have supper at seven as a family. You're welcome to join us this week," Benjamin said, glancing at me in the rearview mirror.

"Thank you, sir. I'd appreciate that," I replied politely.

"Sebastian will show you where you'll be staying and give you a tour of the house." It suddenly hit me—Isabella would be there.

"Th-thank you," I stammered.

"Something wrong?" Alpha Benjamin asked.

My eyes flickered to Sebastian, who was studying me intently. Despite the tension, something unspoken passed between us.

###Chapter 0044

"You're talking about Isabella, aren't you?" Sebastian stated as his father processed my words.

"Yes." My reply was blunt as I met Sebastian's gaze in the mirror. "I don't want to cause trouble in your home."

"This will be entertaining." Benjamin chuckled. "In my pack, we believe in an eye for an eye."

Interesting. "Oh."

"Within reason, of course. But I'll make sure Isabella stays occupied this week." Benjamin turned back around.

"It'll be wonderful having you here," Sophia said. After what Grayson had mentioned, I really studied her. Her eyes were slightly hollow, her frame thinner, and the usual spark in her was missing.

"I think we need to talk, Sophia."

She nodded silently, her gaze dropping. Oliver wrapped his arms around her, pulling her close. "She's been under a lot of stress."

"That's okay. Let me help you sort things out. We'll stay home tomorrow and focus entirely on you."

"If I'd known that was all it took to get you to stay home, I would've said this an hour ago," Oliver muttered under his breath.

"Seems you still have a lot to learn about women," I teased.

"Damn it." Oliver puffed out his chest, feigning offense.

"Did you bring your work? I can help you too," Sophia offered.

"I finished it all."

"All of it?"

"Every last bit. Unless my assistants run into issues, everything's done."

"You have assistants?" Alpha Benjamin asked, raising a brow.

Sebastian hesitated, keeping some of what I'd shared to himself. "Yes, sir. I oversee all school functions. At least until I graduate."

"All of them? For the past four years, it's been you?" Benjamin turned to look at me.

"Yes."

"They've never mentioned your name," Alpha Benjamin noted.

"Correct. That was one of my conditions for taking the role. I didn’t want recognition. I didn’t do it for the praise."

"Then why did you?" Oliver asked.

"To keep busy. And away from Margaret," I shrugged.

"That slap was legendary," Oliver laughed.

"Which reminds me—can I join the warriors' training this week?" I directed the question to Alpha Benjamin.

"Evelyn, they don’t allow ranked women to fight," Sophia interjected.

"What?" My jaw dropped as I turned to Sebastian.

Oliver groaned. "Their role is to support the pack's functioning. It's our job to protect them."

I fixed Oliver with a hard stare. "She's the daughter of a top warrior. She's trained her entire life. Are you seriously telling me you've stripped away one of the most important parts of her identity and now you're wondering why she's struggling to adapt?"

"Evelyn, it's fine," Sophia tried to mediate.

"No, it's not. Alpha Benjamin said an eye for an eye. If you can't make Sophia submit, then she trains." I crossed my arms, locking eyes with Oliver.

"Little help here, Sebastian?"

"Evelyn has a point. Make Sophia submit." I nodded in appreciation of the backup, a small smile tugging at my lips.

"Fine. We'll spar." A barely concealed grin flickered across Sophia's face. I leaned back, gazing out the window.

When we arrived at the pack house, the place was eerily empty. Strange, but the guys didn’t seem bothered. Benjamin, Sophia, and Oliver headed inside while Sebastian grabbed my bag.

"Did I just piss off Oliver?"

"Yes. But Dad and I have been trying to convince him to let her train—or at least fight. That’s not a pack rule. It’s something Oliver made up after the car accident to keep her 'safe.'"

"Sophia doesn’t need protection. I can’t wait to see him figure that out. No wonder she’s been struggling."

Sebastian opened the front door. "Dining room’s down that hall. Since it’s 6:30, I’ll show you to your room first. Then we can tour the place and head straight to supper."

"Am I dressed okay for this?"

"We don’t have a dress code," Sebastian said as we climbed the stairs.

###Chapter 0045

The pack house was enormous, with an old-world charm that immediately drew me in. Constructed from natural stone, it blended seamlessly into the surrounding landscape, exuding an understated elegance. The wooden floors, recently refinished, carried the faint scent of fresh stain as I ventured deeper inside.

Warm hues of brown, cream, and white complemented each other perfectly, creating an inviting atmosphere. Not a single cobweb lingered in the corners—proof of the disciplined staff. Most places had at least a few, but not here.

A grand chandelier, crafted from cascading wooden beads, hung in the foyer. The entire space whispered wealth without screaming it.

"The top floor is reserved for the Alpha's family and special guests," Sebastian explained. "You'll be staying there. My room is here, and yours is just across the hall. My parents' suite is further down, along with a few additional guest rooms."

He pushed open the door to my room. It was tastefully decorated in neutral tones—cream and gray—simple yet refined. A guest room, nothing more. Sebastian set my bag on the bed while I took in the space. Cozy, with a small seating area, but not quite a living room.

"The second floor houses the Beta and Gamma families," he continued. "The ground floor is strictly for guests. No one else lives in the pack house."

"Why am I up here, then?" I asked.

"So I can keep an eye on you."

I smirked. "Maybe we should fight, see who makes who submit."

Sebastian caught my wrist, pulling me against his chest. His hand settled on my waist, and my breath hitched. "When I make you submit," he murmured, his voice low, "there won't be an audience."

I tilted my head. "I think you've got that backward. It'll be me on top."

The double meaning hung between us, his eyes darkening just as a knock sounded at the door.

I stepped back as Sebastian reined himself in. "Hey," Oliver and Sophia greeted us, stepping inside.

"Thought we'd join you," Sophia said, glancing between us with a knowing grin. "Did we... interrupt something?"

"No," I said smoothly. "Sebastian was just learning something new about me. Shall we continue the tour?"

Oliver bit back a laugh as Sebastian playfully shoved him. Sophia linked her arm with mine, pulling me along before I could linger.

"Hold on," Sebastian muttered, stopping us in front of an ornate door. "This is my private library. You're welcome to use it."

He opened the door, and my jaw dropped.

Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves lined three walls, with the fourth left bare—"Still collecting," Sebastian explained. A small balcony overlooked the space, furnished with two plush chairs.

"This is incredible," I breathed, scanning the titles. Some I'd read, others I'd only heard of, and a few were entirely new to me.

"We should keep moving," Sophia said gently, tugging me away before I could get lost in the shelves.

Reluctantly, I followed them downstairs.

"Down this hall, under the stairs, you'll find the game room, gym, and office space," Sebastian said, opening each door for me to peek inside.

"The teens like to hang out here after training," Oliver added. "It's a place to unwind before heading home for the night."

"Sounds fun."

"Or a headache when we have to break up fights," Sebastian muttered, arms crossed.

Sophia grinned. "Locker rooms are through the training area."

Sebastian checked his phone. "We should head to the kitchen."

The dining room boasted grand double doors and several large tables. "There's a more intimate dining area, but we'll be eating here tonight," he said, guiding me to my seat.

He introduced me to the gathered pack members—his mother, Luna Amelia; his father's Beta, Andrew, and his mate, Elizabeth; Gamma Elliott and his mate, Donna; and Gamma Zachary and his sister, Olivia.

I nodded politely, taking my seat as the evening unfolded.

###Chapter 0046

"This is Evelyn Andrews, Alpha Alexander's daughter. She'll be staying with us this week."

"Nice to meet you, Evelyn." Luna Amelia greeted first.

"She prefers Evie," Sebastian corrected his mother.

"Either is fine. It's lovely to meet you all. Your home is stunning."

"Evie it is, then! Thank you. I hear you're quite the busy bee with all those school events you organize." Luna Amelia kept the conversation flowing as the food was served.

"Yes, ma'am. I oversee all the school's events—at least until graduation."

"Why haven't I seen your name on any of the rosters?"

"It was part of the arrangement to keep my involvement anonymous. I do it to assist the teachers and help students who need a boost for college applications. Plus, I enjoy staying occupied."

"All that and running a tattoo shop?" Beta Elizabeth chimed in.

"I hope to keep the business going after school. It's more than just a hobby to me."

"Well, I think that's wonderful," Luna Amelia said, effectively ending the interrogation.

"You turn eighteen this Friday! I can't wait for your birthday celebration," Grandma Donna said warmly.

"It'll definitely be one to remember," I replied politely. Sebastian raised an eyebrow at my comment as he bit into a green bean.

The conversation gradually quieted, allowing me to focus on my meal. The food was incredible—Asian-style meatballs over rice with roasted green beans, drizzled with a spicy sauce that intrigued me. Still, my appetite was lacking. I forced myself to eat half out of politeness before the waitress cleared our plates. Sebastian frowned at my leftovers but, thankfully, stayed silent.

"Dad, if it's alright, we’ll skip the nightcap and let Sophia get Evie settled."

"That’s fine." Relief washed over me.

Nathan, Oliver, Sophia, Sebastian, and I stood.

"Thank you for dinner and for hosting me this week. If there’s anything I can do to help, please let me know."

"The pleasure is ours, dear," Luna Amelia smiled before we turned to leave.

"Kiss-ass," Zachary muttered the second we were out the door. Playfully, I punched his arm.

"Maybe you should take notes on manners?" I smirked as he rubbed his arm.

"Careful, don’t piss off the princess. She’ll put you in your place!" Oliver teased.

"So I’ve heard. I’m more interested in what you’ve got planned for Isabella," Zachary shot back before darting up the stairs ahead of us.

"Oh! Me too!" Sophia squealed.

"Nothing now. If I’m staying here, I won’t disrespect a pack member."

We entered Sebastian’s room—a spacious, masculine space dominated by red and black, with decor that screamed him. Everyone settled onto the couch or armchairs, leaving one seat for me.

"Come on. An eye for an eye. Alpha Benjamin won’t care," Oliver said, lounging against Sophia as she wrapped her arms around him.

"Movie?" Zachary asked, already flipping through Sebastian’s collection.

"Sure," Sophia called.

It had been a hell of a day, but I’d push through. "Action or horror," I suggested.

"What the lady wants, the lady gets." Zachary pulled out a Transformers film and popped it in. Sophia tossed me a blanket before grabbing one for herself.

"What’s with women and blankets?" Zachary scoffed.

"I’m assuming you’re mateless?" I shot back.

He looked almost offended. "So?"

"Only a single man would ask something that stupid," Oliver sighed.

"What he said," I smirked, catching Sebastian watching me. He was the quiet observer, always analyzing.

Curling up with my blanket, I shifted sideways to get comfortable.

###Chapter 0047

I barely lasted five minutes before my eyelids grew heavy. "Is she asleep already?" Zachary's voice drifted to my ears.

"It's been an exhausting day for her," Sebastian murmured.

"Sophia's out cold too," Oliver whispered.

"What the hell's the plan, man? This isn't just some random girl you brought home." Zachary turned on Sebastian sharply.

"I know that. I'm certain she's my mate. I couldn't leave her there."

"So you brought the danger here? I've heard about Dominic. That ruthless bastard will force his mark on her the second she turns eighteen."

"I know!" Sebastian's voice dropped to a growl. "Grayson and I have been talking. He's insanely protective of her. Won't tell me the full story, but she's been drawing Alpha attention for years."

"Sophia says it's because of her strategic mind. She spots patterns that could destroy enemies. No wonder her father's risen so high - sure, he's brutal, but she's his secret weapon."

"That's not why we're protecting her. Brilliant or not, she's our ally and we'll honor the pact," Sebastian stated firmly.

"Not because you want to screw her," Zachary muttered.

"She's strictly business." The words stung more than I expected.

"Bullshit. I've seen how you look at her. If you really believe she's your mate, this is personal," Oliver called him out.

"I'm keeping my distance in case I'm wrong."

"For what it's worth, even without the brains, she'd be perfect for you. Luna material through and through," Zachary said, louder than intended.

"Quiet. I know. I'd be proud to claim her. But the moment we confirm it, Dominic will challenge me."

"At least it's not to the death, but still damn serious," Zachary muttered.

"I know. I'll spend this week training, just in case. Oliver, you'll need to prepare her to fight Isabella on Saturday."

"You won't train her yourself?" Oliver asked.

"I'll observe. But I can't do what needs to be done."

"You already think of her as your mate, don't you?" Zachary pressed.

A heavy pause. "Just go to bed. I'll stay with the girls tomorrow."

Sebastian dismissed them.

"Need help with her?" Zachary offered.

"Get out." The door clicked shut. I heard Oliver lift Sophia and their footsteps fade. Expecting Sebastian to carry me, I was surprised when he cursed and headed to what I assumed was the bathroom. The shower turned on, giving me my chance to slip away to my room.

I'd just changed into silk shorts and a tank when my door burst open. "You could've told me you were awake."

"Strictly business, right?" I moved my things to the chair, watching his body tense as he realized I'd heard everything.

"Listen." I stepped closer. "Either care about me or don't, but don't you dare pity me. I can handle Dominic myself. The only person who's ever beaten me is my father - not even Grayson. I'm no princess. I'm a sarcastic bitch raised with manners like a warrior. I don't need coddling or to be treated like some helpless damsel. I won't accept a mate who tries to suppress who I am. I'm not Sophia. I won't submit quietly. I—"

Sebastian's hands seized me mid-sentence.

###Chapter 0048

Sebastian’s lips crashed into mine before I could protest, his body pinning me firmly against the wall. His arousal pressed insistently against me, and I could feel the dampness between my thighs growing. The air between us crackled with tension as his hands roamed my body, kneading my breasts with a mix of pain and pleasure that sent shivers down my spine.

Our tongues tangled in a fierce battle for dominance, his every movement igniting a fire deep within me. I wanted this—needed it—just as much as he did. The more he touched me, the harder it became to deny the truth: he could be my mate. My body responded to his like a magnet, craving his touch, his heat.

A gasp tore from my lips as Sebastian ripped open my shirt, buttons scattering across the floor. His mouth closed around my nipple, and I arched into him, my breath hitching. I had never gone this far before, and the sudden rush of vulnerability made my pulse race.

"You’re so damn perfect," Sebastian growled against my skin, his voice rough with desire.

Words failed me as I watched him worship my body, his hands and mouth claiming every inch of me. My breasts fit perfectly in his palms, as if they were made for him alone.

My mind screamed for me to stop, but my heart—my body—begged for more.

Sebastian pulled back slightly, his dark eyes locking onto mine. "I won’t take you tonight," he murmured, his thumb brushing my lower lip. "But let me make you feel good."

I trembled beneath him, my breath coming in short, uneven gasps.

"Have you ever done this before?" he asked, his voice low.

I shook my head, unable to speak. A deep, possessive growl rumbled in his chest as he lifted me effortlessly and carried me to the bed. He laid me down gently before covering my body with his, his lips trailing hot kisses along my neck.

"You’re shaking," he murmured, cupping my face. "Tell me to stop, and I will."

I should say yes. I should push him away. But when he shifted slightly, his hardness brushing against the most sensitive part of me, all I could whisper was, "No."

Sebastian exhaled sharply, his restraint evident. "I won’t claim you tonight," he promised, his voice thick with need. "That’s for when we mark each other."

The thought sent a fresh wave of heat through me.

"Feel how your body responds to me," he murmured, his fingers tracing patterns along my skin, leaving goosebumps in their wake. "This is why I know we’re meant to be. You’re all I think about. You’re my addiction."

His mouth returned to my breasts, and I cried out, my back arching off the bed. My hands roamed his torso, memorizing every hard ridge of muscle. There wasn’t an ounce of softness on him—just pure, raw power.

His lips captured mine again as he shifted his weight, settling between my thighs. Instinctively, my legs clenched, but his hands coaxed them apart with gentle insistence. He didn’t stop kissing me as his fingers slipped beneath the edge of my shorts, brushing over the damp fabric of my panties.

When he finally pulled back, he kept his forehead pressed to mine, his breath mingling with mine. "So wet for me," he murmured, his voice rough with approval.

Then his fingers dipped lower, sliding beneath the fabric to tease my entrance. My breath hitched as one finger circled my clit, sending sparks of pleasure shooting through me. My eyes rolled back, my body tensing as the sensation overwhelmed me.

"Look at me," he commanded softly.

I forced my gaze to meet his, finding his eyes dark with desire, concern, and something deeper—something possessive.

"Tell me to stop," he repeated, his finger hovering at my entrance.

Instead of answering, I grabbed his face and pulled him down to me, pressing my body against his as his finger finally pushed inside. A sharp gasp escaped me as he began to move, stretching me slowly before adding a second finger.

"Fuck, you’re tight," he groaned, his jaw clenched with restraint.

But I didn’t want restraint. I needed more. "Sebastian," I moaned, my nails digging into his shoulders. "Faster."

He obeyed instantly, his fingers driving into me with relentless precision. The pressure built inside me, coiling tighter and tighter until—

"Sebastian!" I screamed as pleasure shattered through me, my body clenching around him.

He shuddered above me, his own control fraying. Only when the last tremors of my climax faded did he withdraw, pulling me into his arms. He tucked me against his chest, one leg draped over his, and I felt the damp evidence of my release on his shorts.

Sebastian stroked my hair gently as I buried my face in his chest, my heartbeat slowly returning to normal.

And for the first time, I didn’t question whether he was my mate.

My body already knew the truth.

###Chapter 0049

"Are you alright?" His deep voice cut through the silence.

"I'm fine." My words came out in a shaky whisper as my body gave one final tremble before settling. My breathing steadied, eyelids growing heavy.

"Sleep." His warm palm continued tracing soothing circles on my back until darkness claimed me. It was the most restful night I'd ever experienced.

Dawn hadn't broken when I awoke alone. The digital clock glowed 5:14am in crimson numbers. Chilled air nipped at my skin as I threw off the covers. Needing to burn off restless energy, I headed for the shower.

The hot water barely warmed me before I twisted damp hair into a messy topknot. Slipping into workout gear - sports bra, cropped tank, and shorts - I grabbed my phone. No notifications. Securing it in my waistband with wireless earbuds, I laced up my sneakers.

The compound lay in pre-dawn stillness as I padded toward the training facility. Empty. Perfect.

I mounted a treadmill, syncing my earbuds before starting a light jog. Halfway through my warmup, movement caught my attention. A wall of muscle nodded curtly before taking the adjacent machine, his powerful strides matching my pace effortlessly.

By sunrise, the gym buzzed with activity. Abandoning the treadmill, I snatched two 25lb dumbbells for bicep curls.

"Think you can handle those, sweetheart?" A smirking blond sauntered over, all cocky swagger and inflated ego. Typical playboy type, probably fresh out of puberty.

"I'll manage." I removed one earbud, arching a brow.

"Need a spotter?" He leaned against the weight rack with exaggerated nonchalance.

"For curls?" My laugh held an edge. "Doubt you'd be useful."

The room's energy shifted as curious eyes tracked our exchange.

"Name's Ethan." He flashed what he probably considered a charming grin. "And you are, gorgeous?"

"Evelyn." I continued my reps without breaking rhythm.

"Maybe try something lighter." He hefted a 10lb weight, offering it with condescending flair. "Like this."

"That seems more your speed." My gaze deliberately dropped to his spindly legs. "Though you clearly skipped leg day."

The gym erupted in laughter. Ethan's face darkened.

"I don't tolerate disrespect." He stepped back, fists clenching. "Looks like the new girl needs to learn her place!"

Adrenaline surged through me. "Prove you're man enough to teach me." I set down the weights, removing my earbuds before striding toward the sparring mats.

A circle formed instantly. Ethan's stance betrayed his inexperience - feet too close, weight uneven. He lunged first.

I ducked low, sweeping his legs. To his credit, he rolled and regained footing quickly. When he tried a takedown, I let him wrap arms around my waist only to drive an elbow into his kidney. As he staggered, I locked him in a chokehold, legs scissoring his neck.

The cheers nearly drowned out Sebastian's thunderous voice.

"What the hell is happening here?" The crowd parted like the Red Sea as he stormed forward. "Evelyn, release him."

Ethan gasped like a beached fish when I loosened my grip.

"Morning!" I flashed Sebastian a bright smile.

"Someone explain." His crossed arms emphasized bulging biceps.

"Ethan started it," a female warrior spoke up. "Made his usual passes, then insulted Evelyn's strength. She roasted his chicken legs. Things escalated."

Sebastian's gaze could've melted steel. "True, Ethan?"

"Just joking around, Alpha."

"Did you miss the pack-wide announcement?" Sebastian pinched the bridge of his nose.

"No, Alpha."

"Clearly. Otherwise you'd know this is Evelyn Andrews. Daughter of Alpha Alexander from Crimson Fang Pack."

Ethan's face paled to milk. "Pleasure," I chirped. "Your footwork needs serious improvement."

"Ethan - night patrol. Twenty laps. Now." Sebastian jerked his chin toward the door. "Everyone else - back to training. Evelyn, with me."

Snatching my phone, I jogged after his retreating form.

###Chapter 0050

"What's got you in such a foul mood this morning?" I asked as we rounded the corner.

Sebastian glanced around before shoving me against the wall. His grip tightened around my waist as he growled low in my ear. "I'm the only one who gets to touch your body."

A soft moan escaped my lips before I could stop it. "I wasn't stopping the fight because of that. It was just sparring. But someone needs to learn some manners."

Footsteps approached, and Sebastian immediately stepped back. "Come on," he muttered just as Sophia and Oliver turned the corner.

"What's going on here?" Sophia asked, eyeing us suspiciously.

"Sebastian woke up on the wrong side of the bed," I quipped, earning an eye roll from him.

"Okay…" Oliver gave Sebastian a strange look.

"Anyway!" I grabbed Sophia's hand and tugged her toward the stairs. "I need a shower, then we're getting breakfast and spending the whole day on you!"

"Someone's in a ridiculously good mood," Sophia laughed as she plopped onto the couch and turned on the TV.

"I slept amazingly!" I called over my shoulder before shutting the bathroom door. There was a faint soreness between my legs, but otherwise, I felt incredible.

After a quick shower, I threw on athletic shorts and a simple tee. Nothing fancy, but I took the time to blow-dry my hair and swipe on some makeup.

"Wow, all this effort just for me today?" Sophia teased when I reappeared.

"I'm just feeling good," I shrugged.

"Does this good mood have anything to do with a certain someone?"

"More like the change of scenery," I lied. But yes, it had everything to do with a certain someone.

We headed to the kitchen, where only Oliver and Sebastian had beaten us. I slid into the seat beside Sebastian while Sophia took her usual spot next to Oliver. The food was laid out buffet-style—sausage, bacon, waffles, pancakes, even biscuits and gravy.

"Help yourselves, ladies," Oliver nodded toward the spread.

"Perfect!" Sophia squealed, already piling her plate high. I grabbed a bowl of oatmeal, adding milk and sugar before joining her.

"Find what you wanted?" Sophia asked as she sidled up beside me.

"I di—" My words died as I turned and saw a group of girls had settled around the guys. Disappointed, I just shrugged and moved to the far end of the table. Sophia followed.

"I could’ve made them move…" she offered.

"You can if you want to sit next to Oliver," I said lightly.

Sophia glanced over and sighed before sitting across from me.

"Are you really going to help me?" she whispered.

"Of course. You’re amazing with me—I don’t get why you’re struggling here."

"Oliver wants me to do things his way, not mine. We keep butting heads."

"It’s hard letting someone else take control," I said between bites.

"How do you eat that?" Sophia wrinkled her nose at my oatmeal.

"Because it’s delicious," I laughed.

"Are you sure you’re wearing that red dress tonight?"

"Hell yes!" Sophia cheered, and we both burst into laughter.

"I can’t wait to see her face. It’s going to be epic."

"Me too! Let me put some stones in your hair!"

"Deal!"

"YES!" She pumped her fist.

"Just not like last time. I looked like a damn bedazzled frog." Sophia dissolved into giggles, and soon we were both laughing so hard we were crying.

The guys approached just as we were wiping our eyes.

"What’s so funny?" Oliver asked.

"Sophia’s exceptional talent for decorating amphibians," I said dryly. "Done with your little fan club?"

"Why didn’t you come back and sit with us?" Oliver sounded almost hurt.

"You were surrounded and didn’t even notice we were gone. Figured it was important."

###Chapter 0051

"You weren't jealous?" Oliver asked Sophia.

"I mean, I didn't love it, but you're the Beta. You have responsibilities—meeting with pack members, handling disputes. That includes talking to other girls." She shrugged. "I could've said something, and you would've made space for me."

"Exactly what she said." I glanced at Sebastian.

"I've got to head to class. Come say goodbye." Oliver tickled Sophia as they dashed off, playfully swatting her backside before disappearing down the hall.

"I'm glad she's happy here."

Sebastian exhaled. "She hasn't smiled like that in weeks."

"Really?"

"Not once."

"I could tell you why." I gathered our trays and carried them to the drop-off window.

"Enlighten me."

"Oliver needs to let her be herself. Not some perfect Beta's mate molded by his mother's expectations. She's capable, but he keeps undermining her. She doesn’t feel seen."

"She told you that?" Sebastian asked as we walked toward his office.

"I didn’t need words to see it."

He held the door open for me. I settled on one end of the couch while he took the other. "So, you weren’t jealous?"

"First, you didn’t exactly look for me. Second, we aren’t officially mated yet. I’m just some random girl claiming a seat next to you. Not a good look. People will assume we’re together. You called me a business transaction."

Sebastian’s gaze darkened. "That was for Adrian’s benefit. You know it’s more than that."

"Then I’ll wait until you’re ready to show everyone."

"The Ice Queen wants a grand reveal?" He smirked.

"No. Just to be chosen—publicly."

###Chapter 0052

"That's quite the exaggeration," Sophia murmured, shaking her head.

"It's not an exaggeration, Sophia." Sebastian's voice was firm. "If this information falls into the wrong hands, they could orchestrate an attack on our pack. People could die. As beta female, your duty is still to protect the pack with your life. This is what it means to hold rank."

"You were raised knowing you'd sacrifice yourself for any pack member?"

"So was your father. He was one of our finest warriors. Yes, we trained for it, but we never faced real battle. Now that you're a ranking wolf, you need to take this seriously."

"Oh..." Sophia's eyes widened. "Now I get why you wanted to leave!"

"Sophia, that wasn't why." Sebastian sighed. "I needed to get away from Margaret. From constantly watching my back, living in fear. But I love being a ranking wolf—helping people. Grayson and I opened that bar to create jobs for our pack. When someone thanks you for changing their life? That’s everything. You’ll find your purpose here too. Once you do, all of this will make sense."

"Thank you." Sophia blinked back tears. "I already feel lighter."

"I know you’ll be an incredible beta female. Your heart is pure, and when you find where to direct that passion, it’ll be worth every struggle."

"You're right. I just have to keep going." Sophia gathered her things. "I’ll put these away and bring up lunch."

"Thanks." Evelyn watched her leave before turning to clean up the scattered supplies.

"You’re a natural at this," Sebastian remarked.

"One of my many hidden talents." She smirked, reaching for her phone.

A quick call to the shop’s answering machine confirmed her only appointment—a three-hour session—had canceled. Harrison’s grandmother had passed.

Evelyn’s shoulders slumped. "One of our pack members canceled. His grandma just died. I wish I could bring him something. Maybe Grayson could—"

"I’ll take you." Sebastian cut in. "Afterward, you can finish my tattoo."

###Chapter 0053

"What's wrong?" Grayson asked as I stepped out of the car.

"Harrison canceled his appointment because of his grandmother. Thought I'd bring him a care package."

"I figured you might, so I grabbed one for you." Grayson handed me the basket. "Sebastian." He shook Sebastian's hand.

"Margaret's in a panic, so as much as I'd love to chat, you should probably head out."

"Got it. Thanks, Grayson!"

The guys exchanged nods as we climbed back into the car. With Sebastian following my directions, we reached Harrison's house without any trouble. A small crowd had gathered outside.

"You don't have to come in if you don't want to," I told Sebastian as I opened the car door.

"I'll wait out here." Sebastian leaned against the hood, watching as I walked toward the house.

"Evelyn! You didn’t need to come! I feel terrible." Harrison looked completely distraught.

"Don’t." I set the basket on the table beside the other sympathy cards and was immediately pulled into conversation.

It took me fifteen minutes to finally excuse myself.

When I stepped outside, Sebastian was checking his watch.

"Evelyn?" A tiny voice called from behind me. It was Harrison’s daughter, Abigail. She was only three. I knelt down just as she sprinted toward me, throwing her arms around my neck with all her strength.

"Oh, sweetheart. You’ll see her again," I whispered, rubbing her back. Olivia, Harrison’s mate, came out to collect her.

"Mommy!" Abigail sobbed.

"I’m sorry, she’s been inconsolable."

"Are you planting something for her?" I asked.

"Yes."

"Abigail?" I crouched down again. "Maybe you can help Mommy and Daddy pick out a special flower for Grandma?"

Abigail sniffled but nodded. "Otay."

"Thank you," Olivia said softly before carrying her inside.

Sebastian held the car door open for me without a word. Once I was settled, he slid into the driver’s seat. "Sorry that took longer than I thought."

"It’s fine." This time, it was me who reached for his hand. He didn’t resist, sending a flutter through my stomach.

We waved at the guards as we drove off, windows down, the wind tangling in my hair. By the time we reached my shop, dark clouds loomed in the distance.

"Are we expecting rain?"

"Not until later, I thought," Sebastian muttered, eyeing the sky.

I unlocked the door, relocking it behind us once Sebastian was inside. Dropping my things on the counter, I gathered my supplies.

"Assuming you can handle pain, we can finish this tonight. But we can stop if it gets too much."

"Damn." Sebastian pulled off his shirt and sat with his back to me.

"This might be cold." I sprayed his skin before cleaning the area. A few faint scratches on his shoulders made me smirk.

"What?"

"I told you not to let any girls mark up your back."

Sebastian turned to look at me. "You charging me for what you did?"

"Maybe… But not in cash." I grinned, nudging him back around.

"What does the princess want, then?"

I flicked on my tattoo machine and got to work.

"Hmm, any ideas?"

"I don’t know. A date? A massage?"

"Hmm, I was thinking something more… thrilling."

"Oh? Like what?"

"A midnight ride on your bike."

"Think I can manage that. Let me figure out the details." He agreed far quicker than I expected.

"Really? Perfect."

"You thought I’d say no?"

###Chapter 0054

"I'm going to prove to you that's exactly what I intend to do."

It took me a moment to respond. "Oh?"

"Don't you think you deserve that?" Sebastian asked, his voice low and teasing.

"It's not about deserving," I admitted, my fingers tracing the edge of the tattoo machine. "I have all these dreams, but no matter how hard I try to be good, will they ever come true?"

"What dreams?" His gaze was intense, searching.

"Ask me again on Friday." I smirked, deflecting. This was getting too personal. "What are you wearing to the event?"

"A tux. Maybe with a red tie."

"Not bad." I nodded approvingly.

"Good. Now lie down." Sebastian stood, and I adjusted the chair. He stretched out on his stomach, and I had to force myself not to think about last night.

"Sebastian?"

"Yes?"

"Why were you in such a mood this morning?"

He exhaled sharply. "I spent the night with you, only to find you wrapped around another guy's head at dawn. What do you think?"

"So… you don’t regret it?"

His head snapped up, eyes dark. "Never ask me that again. I don’t regret a single second with you." The intensity in his voice made my breath hitch.

"Okay."

He settled back down, but his hand slid to my thigh as I worked. His thumb traced slow circles along the sensitive skin. "I didn’t realize you were this responsive."

"1. Am. Not. Sensitive." I scoffed.

"You are," he murmured, fingers pressing just a little harder. "You just hide it well."

"If I hide it so well, how would you know?"

"Because you let me see it last night. And the little things you say—you don’t give those away easily. Hell, you can’t even tell Sophia you love her."

"Yeah, well… you came in your shorts." It was a weak retort.

"First time for everything," he muttered.

"When did you leave my bed?"

"About 4:30. Wanted to go for a run. Got back just in time to hear the cheering outside."

"Ah."

"How did you sleep?"

"Better than I have in years."

"You’re welcome," he grumbled.

"Pretty sure it was the mattress," I teased.

A deep growl rumbled through him. "Is that so?"

"Guess you’ll have to try harder next time." I smirked, meeting his gaze.

His hand slid higher, fingers slipping beneath the edge of my panties. With his other hand, he pulled my chair closer, lifting me until my hips were flush against him—all while he stayed on his stomach, his touch maddeningly slow.

"Go on. Finish the tattoo," he ordered, voice rough.

I tried to focus, but his fingers moved in torturous patterns—speeding up, slowing down—until my breathing turned ragged.

It took nearly four hours to finish. Every time I neared the edge, he’d ease off just enough to make me whimper.

"Done," I managed, my voice unsteady.

His phone rang. He answered one-handed, refusing to let me go.

"She’s finishing up my tattoo. We’ll be there soon." Click.

"I’m done," I repeated. "Want to see it?"

"Let’s go." He stood without removing his hand, switching to his other so he could slide fingers into my shorts. He pulled me up, guiding me toward the mirror, his grip firm as my legs trembled.

Then—three fingers inside me, his free hand squeezing my breast, his hardness pressing against my back.

"Oh!"

"What was that?" he whispered against my ear, hitting that spot with ruthless precision.

###Chapter 0055

A wicked thought ignited within me—two could play this game. My fingers trailed down, slipping beneath the waistband of Sebastian's shorts. I wrapped my hand around his length, stroking him deliberately.

"You're playing with fire," Sebastian growled, his voice thick with warning.

"I'm ready," I breathed.

"Not yet." His hand withdrew from me abruptly, and before I could react, he yanked my shorts down to my ankles. My shirt and bra followed in quick succession, leaving me completely bare before him.

Sebastian pulled me down, spreading my legs wide. "Watch me f*ck you," he commanded, his breath hot against my ear. My gaze locked onto his fingers as they moved with practiced precision, drawing gasps from my lips. My hands fisted in his shorts, desperate for something to hold onto. "Oh—oh—" Just as I teetered on the edge, he pulled away.

"What was that?" he teased, smirking as I struggled to form words, my entire body trembling.

"Please," I begged.

In one swift motion, he spun me around and buried his face between my thighs. My hips jerked as his tongue worked magic, my fingers tangling in his hair to keep him there. "Sebastian—please!" His fingers returned, curling inside me as he sucked my clit, sending me spiraling into bliss.

When I finally came down, I lay sprawled beneath him, breathless. Sebastian groaned, hovering over me. "You okay, sweetheart?"

Sweetheart? No one had ever called me that before. "Y-yeah. Totally... unaffected," I managed between ragged breaths.

He chuckled. "Probably should shower before we head back."

"Okay," I agreed, though I made no move to get up.

"Come on. Oliver's waiting for you to train."

"You just sucked the soul out of me and expect me to train?" I scoffed.

Sebastian burst into laughter. "Yes, I do." He hauled me to my feet and nudged me toward the bathroom. "I'll clean this up. You clean that up."

"You caused all of this," I shot back as he shut the door.

After a quick rinse, I redressed, knowing I’d need fresh clothes for training anyway. When I stepped out, Sebastian had already tidied everything, the sheets in the sterilizer.

"How—?"

"Watched you do it. Wasn’t hard. Let’s go." He flicked off the lights and steered me toward the door.

"Wait." He caught me just as I reached for the knob, spinning me around to press a soft, lingering kiss to my lips. "Good luck with training."

"Hmm, maybe I should train more often if this is my reward," I mused as I unlocked the door.

"I'd rather you didn’t," he muttered, rolling his eyes.

Just as he reached for his own door, the screech of tires cut through the air. "Get down!" Sebastian tackled me to the ground as bullets riddled his car. The attackers didn’t linger, speeding off as quickly as they’d come.

"You okay?" I asked, scanning the damaged vehicle.

"Yeah, I'm good." He stood, pulling me up with him.

"We need to go."

Sebastian jumped into the driver’s seat, the engine roaring to life. I barely had time to buckle in before he floored it.

"Call your dad. Tell him to meet us at my pack." His voice had shifted—still deep, but edged with something dangerous.

I didn’t hesitate, dialing my father’s emergency line.

"Evelyn? What happened?"

"Get Grayson and meet us at Alpha Benjamin’s. Sebastian and I were just shot at!"

"Are you hurt?"

"No, Sebastian shielded me." That’s when I noticed how pale he’d gone. "Sebastian? Were you hit?" His eyelids fluttered. "Dad!" I screamed as the car veered off the road, slamming into a tree.

Darkness swallowed me for a heartbeat before adrenaline kicked in. I’d been thrown from the wreck, but miraculously, nothing was broken. Sebastian slumped against the airbag, unconscious.

###Chapter 0056

"Sebastian!" The car had crashed into a tree, and I found myself sprawled across the hood. My legs screamed in protest as I slid off, but I ignored the pain. Whoever had shot at us could return at any moment. I had to get Sebastian out of here.

After three attempts, I finally wrenched the door open. Blood streamed down Sebastian’s arm. Without hesitation, I tore off my shirt and wrapped it tightly around the wound, using a stick to twist it into a makeshift tourniquet. A hair tie secured it in place. Frantically, I searched his pockets until I found his phone. I had to prop him up just enough for the facial recognition to unlock it.

Relief flooded me when it worked. I dialed his father.

"Sebastian."

"It’s Evelyn. We were leaving the tattoo shop when someone drove by and opened fire. Sebastian was hit in the shoulder. We tried to escape, but he passed out, and we crashed. We’re just past the old bridge. Hurry—they might come back."

"I’m on my way!"

"My dad was supposed to meet us. I was on the phone with him when we crashed. Call him—I don’t know where my phone is."

"Got it. Anything else?"

"Sebastian needs a doctor, or he’ll lose his arm." The roar of an approaching engine sent my pulse skyrocketing. "Sh*t, they’re back. Move fast!" I hung up and shoved his phone into my bra.

Looping Sebastian’s arm over my shoulder, I hauled him from the wreckage. Adjusting my grip, I managed a modified fireman’s carry and dragged him into the underbrush. I wouldn’t get far, but I could buy us time.

The car screeched to a halt. Three doors slammed.

"Come out and play!" The chilling click of a gun being cocked echoed through the trees.

Silently, I crept around, positioning myself to strike from behind. One man lingered by the car while the other two prowled into the forest. Their stench hit me—rogues. This wasn’t random.

At the last second, I lunged, my claws slicing deep into one rogue’s throat. Blood sprayed as I snatched the gun from his lifeless grip.

"Stop right there, sweetheart!"

Slowly, I raised my head. Two rogues stood before me, their weapons trained on my chest.

"No." I aimed my stolen gun at the first one.

"No?"

"If I’m going down, one of you is coming with me." My voice was steel. "What do you want?"

"You," the second one sneered.

"For who?"

"Come with us and find out." They shifted, one circling behind me. I was trapped.

"Not happening."

A deep, familiar growl rumbled through the trees. Liam. That meant my father was close.

Everything happened in a blur. A gunshot. Then mine. Liam collapsed behind me, and searing pain exploded in my chest. I toppled backward over his body, time slowing to a crawl.

Grayson’s face swam into view as two wolves tore into the rogues.

"Sebastian…" I tried to point, but my body was being lifted.

"Get her to the hospital!" Someone barked.

The world snapped back into focus. "No! Sebastian first!"

"Where’s my son?" Benjamin rushed to my side, Oliver and Adrian close behind with Andrew and Elliott.

"I hid him. Keep him safe." I fought to stay conscious. "Behind the log…" I weakly gestured.

Benjamin sprinted toward the spot as I sagged against Grayson. They dragged out a motionless body.

"Take him first," I insisted.

Oliver punched a tree, the sound jolting me back to awareness. My chest burned like hell. Looking down, I saw blood soaking through my shirt.

"Grayson?"

"You were shot, Scarlett."

###Chapter 0057

I reached into my bra and pulled out Sebastian's phone. The bullet was embedded deep in the shattered screen. A dark purple bruise was already blooming across my chest. "I'm okay," I murmured, leaning against Grayson. My gaze drifted to Liam's lifeless body. "He saved me."

"He loved you," Grayson whispered, tightening his arms around me as silent tears streaked down my face.

"Stupid idiot! We had a plan!" Nathan's voice cracked with grief, mirroring Oliver's devastation.

"Your turn, miss," an EMT said as another ambulance arrived. They helped me onto a stretcher. "We need to remove all this glass and check your injuries."

"We'll meet you there," Grayson promised, his eyes lingering on Liam.

"Oliver, need a ride to the hospital?"

"Yes." He jumped in and grasped my hand. "Thank you for saving Sebastian." His eyes welled up as the doors closed and we sped away. Numbness consumed me. Liam was gone, and Sebastian was barely clinging to life—all because they wanted me.

The EMTs started an IV and administered antibiotics. They examined the gash on my forehead. "This doesn't look too bad."

"Yeah, the tree broke my fall," I muttered sarcastically.

"How much longer?" Oliver asked impatiently.

"Thirty seconds."

Right on cue, the ambulance screeched to a halt. As they wheeled me inside, I locked eyes with Benjamin. He rushed over. "Is she alright?"

"After we hung up, I put Sebastian's phone in my bra. Here." I handed it to him. His fingers brushed the bullet lodged in it. "Maybe you can salvage it."

Benjamin was silent for a long moment before straightening. "You saved my son. I owe you everything. I heard... you lost someone tonight."

"Liam. Yes." Fresh tears spilled over.

"We need to take her back," a medic interjected. Benjamin stepped aside, and the gurney rolled forward.

Two hours later, they'd removed every shard of glass and stitched up my forehead. Miraculously, no bones were broken—just deep bruises and hematomas.

Grayson entered with a wheelchair. "Ready?"

"I'm not leaving."

"I know. We're going to see Sebastian."

"Is he okay?"

"He's awake. Come on. He's threatening to tear the place apart if he doesn't see you."

That coaxed a small smile from me as I settled into the chair. Grayson gave me his shirt since they'd cut off my bra. At least I still had my shorts. We turned down several hallways before shouting reached us.

"Sebastian, calm down before they sedate you!" Benjamin's voice carried down the corridor.

"Where is she?" Sebastian roared.

"Right here," I said softly. Everyone turned toward me.

"You're alive!" Sebastian tried to lunge out of bed, but three nurses held him down.

With Grayson's help, I stood and approached his bedside. Sebastian scooted over so I could sit. His arms wrapped around me in a crushing embrace. "Are you okay?"

"Your phone saved me."

"What?" He pulled back, confused.

"Here." Benjamin handed the damaged phone to Sebastian, who stared at the bullet. "What happened?" Just then, my father entered the room.

"Evelyn!" He rushed to me and pulled me into a tight hug.

"Daddy!"

"I heard the crash. I was terrified." He wiped his eyes roughly.

"We all were," Grayson said quietly. "You were on speakerphone with Nathan and L-Liam."

"Harrison was my appointment tonight. His grandmother passed, so Sebastian wanted to finish his tattoo. Afterward, Oliver was supposed to train with me for Saturday's match. Then we heard the tires—" My voice broke as tears fell. Sebastian gripped my hand.

"They shot at us."

"Sebastian shielded me. I didn't even know he'd been hit!" More tears streamed down my face. "We were thrown from the car. Landed on the hood. Lost my phone. I managed to open Sebastian's door and found his phone. After applying a tourniquet, I called you." I looked at Benjamin. "I heard their car coming, so I carried Sebastian and hid him. He wasn't moving—he'd lost so much blood. Then I heard car doors. At least three of them. I couldn't take them alone, so I flanked them. I took out one, but they heard me. I had the gun—" I dissolved into sobs. Sebastian pulled me against his chest as I wept uncontrollably.

###Chapter 0058

"They came for me," I whispered, my voice barely audible in the sterile hospital room.

Sebastian's grip on my hand tightened. His jaw clenched, eyes dark with fury. "They wanted you?"

I nodded, swallowing hard. "They didn't say why. Just that they were there for me. I thought—if I went with them, they’d leave you alone."

"Never." His voice was sharp, commanding. "You don’t trade your life for mine. Ever."

Benjamin, Sebastian’s father, stood across from my dad, his expression unreadable. "We track them down together."

My father, Brian, extended his hand. "No mercy."

Benjamin clasped it firmly. "None."

The alliance was sealed.

Grayson, my twin, stayed silent in the corner, his phone buzzing incessantly. Sophia—my best friend—would be losing her mind by now.

Sebastian shifted beside me, wincing as the movement tugged at his wound. "Tissue damage," he muttered. "But it nicked an artery. You saved my life."

I didn’t respond. My fingers traced the edge of the hospital blanket, my mind replaying the moment Liam—Ace—had stepped in front of me.

He took the bullet meant for my heart.

The door burst open before I could spiral further.

"WHERE IS SHE?" Sophia’s voice echoed down the hallway before she stormed in, her eyes wild with panic.

Oliver, Sebastian’s best friend, trailed behind her, looking exasperated. "She wouldn’t wait."

Sophia took one look at me and Sebastian tangled together on the hospital bed before launching herself at me. "You’re alive," she choked out, tears streaming down her face.

I hugged her back just as tightly. "I’m okay."

She pulled back, wiping her eyes. "Liam—he—"

"I know." My throat closed.

Sophia sniffed, then turned to Sebastian. "And you?"

Sebastian’s expression darkened. "Fine."

Oliver cleared his throat. "What happened?"

Sebastian tossed his phone at him. "Ambush. Took a bullet to the shoulder. Evelyn hid me, then killed one of them. Liam took the second shot meant for her."

Oliver’s face paled as he scrolled through the photos.

Sophia grabbed my hand. "You need to eat. I’ll get you something from the cafeteria."

I nodded, grateful for the distraction.

The moment she left, Grayson spoke for the first time. "It’s bad."

I didn’t need to ask what he meant. The weight of Liam’s loss settled over the room like a suffocating blanket.

Sebastian exhaled sharply. "We’ll make them pay."

Benjamin’s voice was ice. "Every last one of them."

I closed my eyes, letting the rage and grief swirl inside me.

This wasn’t over.

Not even close.

###Chapter 0059

"You're angry with me? You're blaming ME for this?"

Oliver had the decency to look guilty. Sebastian placed his hand on my shoulder, giving it a reassuring squeeze.

"Scarlett, calm down. Tensions are running high right now. He nearly lost his Alpha."

"But he didn't! Because I saved him! It wasn't your pack that suffered a loss! If you need a damn tissue to control your emotions, check my purse, but get the hell out of my sight!" My eyes darkened completely, shifting to pure black.

Grayson stood abruptly. "Oliver, you need to leave."

"Evelyn, sweetheart, look at me." Sebastian tried to redirect my focus away from Oliver, but Oliver was frozen in place, his wolf recognizing the danger in my gaze. Benjamin stepped forward and shoved Oliver out of the room. Only when he was gone did I finally exhale, my shoulders relaxing slightly. Sebastian wrapped his arm around me, pulling me close. His touch helped soothe the storm inside me, and gradually, my eyes returned to normal.

"That’s the fastest I’ve ever seen her wolf settle," Grayson muttered under his breath.

"Do you still doubt we’re mates?" Sebastian asked, a hint of smugness in his tone.

"Not at all." Grayson crouched in front of me. "Eve."

"What?"

"Look at me."

"He’s right. This is my fault. They wanted me. Sebastian got hurt because they were trying to take me."

"No, Evelyn. This isn’t your fault, and Sebastian would agree."

"I do. None of this is on you." Sebastian rubbed slow circles on my back.

"You just need rest. Come lie down." Grayson guided me to the couch, tucking a pillow beneath my head before draping a blanket over me. "Close your eyes. Sleep." His fingers combed gently through my hair until exhaustion finally pulled me under.

Sebastian’s POV

I was in deep. Already falling for her, hard. Watching her brother lull her to sleep grated on me—that was my damn job. I didn’t need to wait until Friday to know she was meant to be mine. Every instinct screamed it.

Oliver was an idiot. He’d pissed her off worse than I’d ever seen. Her eyes had gone black.

"This isn’t her fault," Grayson murmured to me.

"Never thought it was." He was ridiculously protective of her, but I understood why. She was extraordinary. I just didn’t like sharing the role.

"Get your Beta in line before she does. Her wolf is ancient, and it likes blood." That admission stunned me.

"I’m starting to realize that. What else should I know?"

"My wolf is the twin of hers. This isn’t a threat, but we don’t lose. We don’t stop until there are bodies. I’ve kept her restrained so far, but if it’s true that you’re her mate, that’s your responsibility now. You need to learn how to calm her."

"How has she not torn Margaret apart?"

"Two reasons. One—me. I’ve stopped her. Two—killing Margaret would destroy our father. He’s already lost one mate."

"So she endures it."

"Evelyn has the purest heart. It balances the blood on her hands. If you’ve noticed, she doesn’t even think about the rogue she killed barehanded. She’s grieving Liam. The fact that she cares keeps her grounded."

"Did she love him too?"


###Chapter 0060
Sebastian POV

"Not like that. He's always been like an older brother to her. Sure, they kissed sometimes, but that was it. I ordered Liam never to cross that line. I doubt Evelyn even knows. She used him for comfort when Margaret was at her worst. Liam understood, but he got too attached. For what it's worth, it was never about choosing between you two. It was about choosing you without crushing Liam's feelings."

"Good."

"Do you love her?"

"Absolutely." I didn't hesitate.

"Good. She needs someone strong to protect her. I knew I couldn't do it forever. I'm trying to step back, but damn if I won't be there when she needs me. Hearing her scream 'Daddy' before that sickening crash—the sound of her body shattering glass—it haunts me."

"I just wanted to get her home safe before I passed out. At first, I didn't even feel the pain. All I could think about was her."

"Tomorrow's Wednesday. Obviously, she won't be at school. Hell, she should've skipped high school altogether after eighth grade."

"Assuming you're tightening security for Friday?"

"Yes."

"I'll send my men too."

"We'd appreciate that."

"Anything for her," I muttered.

"Agreed."

"Listen, man, I'm sorry about Liam. Truly. Losing a best friend and Beta isn't easy."

Grayson nodded, his gaze lingering on Evelyn. With a sigh, he extended a hand. "I should go. I'll bring you both new phones tomorrow. Taking this one for analysis."

"Thanks."

Oliver stepped forward as Grayson turned, but in one fluid motion, Grayson spun and landed a perfect right hook, sending Oliver sprawling. Unfortunately, Oliver was still conscious. Grayson yanked him up by the collar. "Watch your mouth around my sister, or next time, you won't walk away." He dropped him and strode off.

"Damn," Oliver groaned, rubbing his jaw as he stood.

"You earned that," I said coldly.

"Yeah, I know. I thought you were dead. You were covered in blood, lifeless."

"Need that tampon my girl offered you?"

"Your girl, huh?"

"Damn right."

"She'll make one hell of a Luna."

"That she will. Maybe you'll live to see it."

"When do you get out?"

"Leaving tomorrow, no matter what. Only stayed because she's asleep."

"Sophia's pissed at me."

"We need to talk about her."

"Damn."

"Let her do things her way, not how your mother did. Stop holding her back."

"Is that you or the Luna over there talking?"

A warm satisfaction spread through me at him calling her Luna. "Both."

"Fine. I'll back off," Oliver sighed.

"I'm on guard duty. That's my punishment. Benjamin took Sophia home after she ripped into me."

"Good. Go stand guard and let me sleep." I wasn't tired, but I was done talking. Oliver turned to leave but paused, glancing back.

"Glad you're okay. And... I'm sorry."

"Don't apologize to me," I said. He nodded and shut the door behind him.

Closing my eyes, I drifted into restless sleep, waking intermittently until movement beside me stirred me fully. Looking down, Evelyn curled against me. Wrapping my arm around her, I finally slept soundly.

Evelyn’s POV

A noise jolted me awake. Sebastian slept peacefully, but angry whispers outside the door had me alert. Every muscle protested as I tried to sit up—reminders of being thrown through a windshield. Moving carefully, I pressed my ear to the door.

"You're not going in there!" Oliver hissed.

"The hell I'm not!" Nathan snapped.

I yanked the door open. Both froze, realizing they were in deep trouble.

"What the hell is going on?"

###Chapter 0061

"Scarlett, it's Liam's father. He lost it completely. They had to sedate him. He's blaming you for choosing Sebastian over him."

"There was no need to tell her this now! It could've waited. What do you expect her to do?" Oliver was unexpectedly defending me. I shot him a questioning look before crossing my arms.

"I don't know. Everything's just... messed up. My brother is gone. I just..." Nathan was drowning in grief.

"Sit down," I told him. He obeyed immediately, burying his face in his hands. "I don't blame him for reacting like that. He just lost his son. His only son. I'd be shocked if he took it well. Liam died a hero, and he'll be remembered as one. I feel your pain. He was my brother too. He was part of us, and he always will be. It would dishonor his memory if we fell apart now instead of finding who did this. We will get revenge, but you have to stay sharp. We can't afford to lose you too."

"I know you're right, but damn..." Nathan's voice cracked.

"I know." My eyes burned, dry from all the tears I'd already shed. "We'll keep him with us."

Just then, Grayson sprinted down the hallway, stopping short when he saw us. He exhaled sharply, realizing he was too late.

"Sis, why are you out of bed?"

"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have come," Nathan muttered, standing.

"You can always come to me," I said firmly. "Nathan, keep pushing forward. For Liam." He nodded and turned to leave.

"You okay?" Grayson asked me.

"Sore, but alive." He gave a curt nod before following Nathan.

I had just reached for the door when Oliver spoke up. "Evelyn, I'm sorry."

"Save it. Not in the mood." My gaze flicked to the bruise on his cheek. "Grayson?"

"Yeah."

"You're lucky that's all you got." I walked inside without another word.

"What happened?" Sebastian asked.

"Nathan said Liam's dad had to be sedated."

"Come here." Sebastian opened his arms. I hesitated before slowly making my way over, curling up beside him.

"What do you want to do to honor Liam?"

"What do you mean?" His question caught me off guard.

"A memorial tree? A ceremony?"

"Oh... I'm not sure." I hadn't even thought about it. Resting my head against his shoulder, I felt his hand settle on my thigh.

"Just tell me what you want, and we'll make it happen." He pressed a kiss to the top of my head.

"What changed? Last night, you were upset when Sophia said he loved me."

"Grayson and I talked."

"Oh." Damn him. "What else did you talk about?"

"Nothing important."

"That's a lie, but whatever. I just want to go home and shower."

"Which home? Mine or your old pack?"

My first instinct was his, but his question was valid. "I guess your home isn't really mine yet."

"But it is."

"Maybe by Friday, but right now, I'm just a guest."

"You're coming home with me. End of discussion."

"I wasn't arguing." Sliding off the bed, Sebastian pressed the call button. He grabbed the sweats his father had brought and pulled them on.

A nurse walked in. "What do you need?"

"We're leaving," Sebastian said flatly.

"Can you wait a few more hours?"

"No." He yanked off his gown, leaving the sling on.

"Fine. Sign these." She handed him discharge papers. "Call if you need anything." With a sigh, she left.

Nathan poked his head in. "What's up?"

"We're leaving." Sebastian wheeled a chair toward me. "Sit."

Too sore to argue, I sat. Oliver took over pushing as we left the hospital. The morning air was crisp. The car wasn't far, so we made it without issue. Sebastian climbed into the back with me while Oliver drove. Exhausted, I leaned against Sebastian, my eyelids growing heavy.

"She's asleep," Oliver whispered.

"Good." Sebastian exhaled.

"I told her I was sorry. She didn't want to hear it."

###Chapter 0062

Sebastian let out a soft snort. "You're shocked?"

"Not exactly. Just wishing she'd forgive me already."

"Maybe once she's showered and rested."

His hand settled on my waist, warm and possessive. It was as if he already knew—no need to wait until Friday. That puzzled me, but I chose not to question it. I must have dozed off because the next thing I knew, car doors were opening.

"Home," Sebastian murmured, helping me out.

I winced, muscles protesting. "How are you not sore?"

"Because I was unconscious. My body didn’t tense up like yours did when you were thrown from the car."

I glanced at his bandaged arm. "How’s it feeling?"

The early morning sun cast long shadows, but thankfully, the pack house was quiet. Sebastian guided me straight to his room.

"Stay here," he muttered, disappearing into his closet. He emerged with one of his shirts. "Want to shower?"

"God, yes."

He turned on the water, adjusting the temperature before stepping aside. The bathroom was stocked—feminine soaps, shampoo, even a razor.

I arched a brow. "Whose are these?"

Sebastian smirked. "Had someone pick them up for you. Wasn’t sure what you preferred, so…"

"You didn’t just ask Sophia?"

"Didn’t cross my mind."

"Thanks." I grabbed what I needed and stepped into the shower.

The hot water stung at first, but soon it was pure relief. I scrubbed away the grime and tension, letting the spray massage my aching muscles. By tomorrow, I’d feel human again.

Wrapped in Sebastian’s shirt—no underwear provided—I brushed my teeth and finger-combed my damp hair.

"Still alive?" Sebastian asked from the bed, a book in hand.

"Barely. That was heavenly."

He nodded toward two pills on the nightstand. "Take those."

"Tylenol?"

"Mmhm."

I swallowed them dry and crawled in beside him. "What’re you reading?"

"The Tempest."

"Shakespeare. Not my favorite, but decent."

He marked his page and flicked off the lamp. The room plunged into darkness, and sleep claimed me instantly.

When I woke, the bed was empty. Steam curled from the bathroom door. Testing my limbs, I found them stiff but functional. My stomach growled.

1:36 PM. Damn, I’d slept half the day away.

Then I spotted my suitcase by the closet. Dressing in soft shorts and a tank, I was twisting my hair into a messy bun when Sebastian emerged—towel slung low on his hips.

"Turn around," I ordered, dreading the sight of his injuries.

"It’s not pretty."

"Let me see." I grabbed lotion from the bathroom. "You’re moving better."

"Shower, drugs, and sleep worked miracles. Now I need food." I smoothed lotion over his back. "Silver lining? You were my Wednesday appointment. No cancellations."

"True." He reached for shorts, and I busied myself with my suitcase to avoid staring.

"Ready?" he asked.

"As I’ll ever be today."

"It’s Wednesday. You haven’t trained at all."

"Been a little busy surviving," I shot back as we descended the stairs. He’d ditched the sling but kept the bandage.

"Oh, Alpha! We were so worried!" A cluster of pack girls rushed toward him.

###Chapter 0063

Sebastian grabbed my hand. "We're fine. Excuse us." The shocked expressions followed us as we made our way to the kitchen.

"Alpha Sebastian, Ms. Evelyn! Can I get you something to eat?" An elderly kitchen staff member asked warmly.

"Yes, please," I replied as we took our seats.

"What would you like?" she inquired.

Sebastian glanced at me. "Whatever's quickest. I'm starving."

"Of course, dear." We watched as she prepared cold-cut sandwiches, wrapping them neatly before adding a fruit bowl and a side of pasta for each of us.

"Thank you." Grabbing our food with plastic forks, we headed out.

"This way," Sebastian said, leading me toward the front door.

"Oh?"

"Sunshine will do you good." We walked a short distance to a picnic area nestled in a park, where young children too small for school ran around, their laughter filling the air.

"This is nice."

"I like coming out here to eat when the weather's good."

I tilted my head. "What else do you enjoy?" I asked, genuinely curious.

He shrugged. "Oh, I don’t know. Watching you work your magic."

"Come on, I’ve told you plenty about myself," I pressed.

"Fine. I like reading, stargazing, Sunday drives, and relaxing with friends."

"Pretty standard stuff," I teased, frowning playfully.

Sebastian paused, considering. "I’m a movie junkie."

"What kind?"

"All of them. From old black-and-white classics to modern Disney."

"Disney? Not the action-hero type?"

"Moana isn’t bad," he quipped, making me laugh.

"I can’t picture it."

"And I collect books."

"I knew that. I need to check out your collection sometime. I have a few at home you might like."

"You can bring your books over on Saturday when you move in."

"So sure of yourself, huh?"

"Yep. 99.9% sure."

"Why?"

"Grayson said my wolf calmed yours down faster than he’s ever seen. Plus, the way your body responded to my touch."

"Grayson told you about our wolves?" For some reason, that irritated me.

"Yes. I think he wanted to see if I’d run."

"Would you?"

"Not a chance. I’d claim you as mine today if I thought you’d let me." I frowned at that. "Exactly. That’s why I said move in on Saturday."

"My wolf didn’t scare you?"

"Nope. If anything, it turned me on."

"Has anything I’ve told you ever scared you?"

"Scared isn’t the right word. Maybe nervous or anxious, but no. You intrigue me. I find you fascinating, sexy, warm."

"Not intelligent?"

"Obviously you are, but that’s not your only quality. You have a huge heart."

His words caught me off guard, and I blinked a few times. Most people only see my brains or my looks.

"Thank you." It took me a moment to take another bite, still processing what he’d said.

"No one’s ever told you that before?" Sebastian asked, pulling me from my thoughts.

"No one who mattered."

"W—" Sebastian froze, likely receiving a mind-link. "You almost done?"

"Yeah, why?"

"They just brought my car back."

Well, damn. Time to put on my big-girl pants and face this. "Okay. Let’s go." Sebastian tossed our trash and led the way to the garage. "Grayson’s here."

"Right on time."

The sun felt incredible on my skin, like I’d been deprived of its warmth for too long. I wasn’t thrilled about seeing the bullet-riddled vehicle, but it was my job. Rounding the corner, everyone stood outside as the tow truck lowered the car. Once unhooked, the driver left.

"Hey, Scarlett. How are you feeling?" Grayson approached and hugged me. Sebastian walked over to his father.

"Better. The shower and sleep helped."

"You should be back to normal by Friday." Grayson nodded.

"That’s the hope." We walked up to the vehicles.

"Hey, kiddo. Doing okay?" Dad asked, keeping his distance. Guess I knew where I got my emotional habits from.

"Yeah, Dad. I’m good." Everyone was inspecting the car, but I circled it, taking in the bullet holes. The one that had hit Sebastian surprised me the most—a larger hole where the bullet had gone clean through both sides, marked by dried blood from where we’d ducked.

###Chapter 0064

"What do you see, Scarlett?" Grayson asked.

"The bullet that hit Sebastian came through the car—different gun. The entry wound is larger. Almost like they wanted to take him out first to make me an easier target. Sebastian and I could’ve handled three rogues without breaking a sweat. This feels like a backup plan. Sloppy. They could’ve ambushed me inside the shop and had a cleaner shot." I moved toward the shattered windshield, flashes of my body crashing through it flickering in my mind. "Look at the angle. The shot came from a rooftop. I’d bet anything they knew he’d shield me, making him an open target. The drive-by was just to position him."

My stomach twisted. Why would anyone want me? There’s nothing extraordinary about me. No fireballs, no laser eyes, no super strength. Just a brain that works too fast for its own good.

"Guess we’re lucky they only took one shot," Benjamin muttered, crossing his arms.

Grayson’s phone buzzed. He stepped away to answer.

"He could’ve shot me when we walked out," Sebastian grumbled.

"Tinted windows. He wasn’t ready—that was his only shot." My gaze dropped to the hood. Smears of blood streaked the metal.

"Evelyn." Grayson’s tone—and the use of my full name—sent a chill down my spine.

"What’s wrong?" I glanced at Sebastian. His expression was unreadable.

"It’s… the shop. Someone broke in. Trashed everything. Cops are there now."

My chest caved in. Tears burned behind my eyes, but I refused to let them fall. "Take me there." I inhaled sharply, lifting my chin.

Grayson exchanged a worried look with Sebastian. "Maybe it’s better if—"

"Finish that sentence, and I’m driving myself." My voice left no room for argument.

Grayson sighed. "Let’s go."

Sebastian fell into step behind him.

This wouldn’t break me.

I repeated it like a mantra the entire ride, fists clenched in my lap. Sebastian reached for my hand, but I pulled away. Not because I didn’t crave his touch—but because if I let myself crumble now, I’d shatter.

When we arrived, the shop was cordoned off with yellow tape, swarmed by officers.

"Bad idea," Sebastian muttered to Grayson.

"I know. She’s hanging by a thread, and now this?"

I barely registered their words. A cop blocked my path. "No civilians past this point!"

"That’s my business!" My voice cracked with fury.

"Let her through," another officer called. "But be careful."

"They’re with me." I jerked my chin at Grayson and Sebastian.

Broken glass littered the sidewalk. Blood streaked the concrete. I stepped over it, calculating trajectories.

"Grayson. The shooter was on that building." I pointed to a mid-rise across the street.

"You sure?"

"Do you doubt me?"

"No."

Sebastian joined us. "What’s up?"

"Shooter was on that roof," Grayson murmured, low enough that human ears wouldn’t catch it.

"She figured that out?"

"Yeah."

I tuned them out as I stepped inside.

Destruction.

My chair—splintered. The 360° mirror—shattered. Holes punched through the floor. Sterilization equipment—obliterated. Ink splattered like gruesome graffiti. My portfolio—ripped to shreds.

Sebastian and Grayson hovered as I picked up two halves of a leg sleeve I’d inked last year. Letting them slip through my fingers, I felt… hollow.

This place was my pride. My future. My life.

"Evelyn Andrews?" A detective approached.

"Yes."

"I have questions. When were you last here?"

"Yesterday afternoon." My eyes locked on the wall. The vandalism… it wasn’t random. The patterns were deliberate.

###Chapter 0065

"When did you leave?" The detective's pen hovered over his notepad.

"I'm not sure. It was late." My fingers twisted the hem of my shirt.

"Was anyone with you?"

"I was." Sebastian moved closer, his presence solid behind me. "She finished my tattoo."

"Know anyone who would do this?" The detective's gaze sharpened.

My breath caught. The symbol on the wall wasn't random graffiti. That abstract crescent moon with midnight stars - the unmistakable emblem of the Nightshade Pack. Dominic.

"No..." The word slipped out as I stumbled back.

"What was that?" The detective's head snapped up.

"Grayson." My voice shook. "It's the Nightshade Pack. Look at the design - it's their crest." I mind-linked my brother. His eyes darkened as he studied the vandalism.

"Miss?" The detective's hand on my shoulder made me jump.

"Nothing." Sebastian stepped between us. "We're leaving now. I'll send you an inventory of damages for insurance." When the detective offered his card, Sebastian intercepted it.

"Thanks." His tone left no room for further questions.

The car door hadn't fully closed before I snatched Grayson's phone. My fingers flew across the screen, pulling up Nightshade Pack images. The matching emblem glowed in the dim light.

"Damn." Grayson showed Sebastian the screen.

"They tagged my wall with their crest." My nails bit into my palms.

"Fucking bastards." Sebastian's jaw clenched. Leaning back, I let the fury simmer. This wasn't just about a rejected date - Dominic was systematically dismantling my life.

"We need an emergency council." Grayson told Sebastian.

"Agreed. Is Alexander still at my territory?"

"Yeah. Let's convene now. This just escalated." Grayson hit the accelerator. I stared out the window, torn between joining the war council or needing space to breathe.

At the packhouse, I lingered by the car while Grayson and Sebastian marched inside with purpose. My brother glanced back, sensing my hesitation. After a brief exchange, Sebastian reluctantly followed Grayson inside.

The evening breeze tangled my hair as I leaned against the hood. Mocking me with its careless freedom. My feet moved without direction, carrying me to a deserted playground.

The swing chains creaked as I rocked slowly. Flashes of the attack played behind my eyelids - Liam's still form, shattering glass, Sebastian collapsing from blood loss, my sanctuary violated.

Fireflies danced in the gathering dusk when Grayson's voice pierced my thoughts. "Where are you, Evie?"

"Some playground. Swinging."

"Stay put."

"My ass is numb from this damn seat."

I could practically hear his eye roll. Moments later, their silhouettes emerged from the shadows. Relief washed over their faces. Sebastian settled beside me while Grayson remained standing.

"We'll need to shut down the shop," I said.

"Temporarily," Grayson agreed.

"Pay everyone for two weeks minimum. Until they find new jobs." My toe traced patterns in the sand.

"I'm heading out." Grayson straightened.

"Drive safe." I met his gaze.

"Sebastian has your new phone. I've already synced mine." He jerked his chin toward Sebastian. "He'll need to set his up."

"Thanks."

"Watch your back." With that, Grayson disappeared into the night.

"I'll never understand twin telepathy," Sebastian muttered.

"Most don't." The chains squeaked as I swayed.

His next words came carefully measured. "If you want separate quarters tonight, I understand."

The suggestion startled me. "You don't want me with you?"

###Chapter 0066

"I do, but you seem to need space. Grayson said to give you space."

"Not that kind of space. Just... wait for me to be ready for you to touch me—like holding my hand. Be there physically, but I'll come to you when I'm ready to be comforted."

"Oh."

"Sorry. Didn’t mean to make you feel any type of way."

"I’m just figuring out how to help you. Learning you, really. Don’t apologize."

"You're doing a good job."

I gave him a small smile. We sat together in silence for a few more minutes.

"How’s your arm feeling?"

"Sore, but manageable." Sebastian sighed.

"Seems strange to have a birthday party on Friday."

"It’ll give people something to look forward to after Liam’s funeral."

"I didn’t give him a basket." I frowned.

"Grayson did. I asked."

"Thank you."

"Funeral’s tomorrow at 10 AM." Sebastian exhaled heavily.

"Hmm."

"Sophia has a dress for you." It was like he read my mind.

"Of course she does." I let out a quiet laugh.

"It might be best if we arrive separately. Sophia will go early with you, and you two can sit together. We’ll be in the back if you need us."

"Thank you for understanding."

"Just promise you’ll come to me." Sebastian’s possessive side flickered in his voice.

"Okay."

"Come on. You need to eat before bed." Sebastian stood but didn’t offer his hand.

"I’m not hungry."

"Try? Please?"

"Fine." I sighed as we walked. The stars emerged as we entered the pack house, quieter than I expected.

Sebastian led us straight to the private dining area, where two plates of pasta waited.

I managed a few bites before pushing my plate away. "I’m done."

"Okay."

To my surprise, he didn’t argue. He stood, and we headed straight to the bedroom, where he searched for a movie. I grabbed a silk pajama set and changed in the bathroom.

When I returned, Sebastian had chosen a film and was dressed only in shorts. We climbed into bed, the TV adjusted to the footboard. He propped himself up on the pillows, and I curled into him, resting my head on his chest as he pulled me close before pressing play.

I was asleep before the opening credits.

The next morning, I woke to the buzz of Sebastian’s phone. He rolled over, replying.

"Who is it?"

"My father."

"What time is it?"

"8:03."

"I should shower. When’s Sophia coming?"

"In thirty minutes." He yawned.

As I moved to get up, Sebastian caught my wrist and tugged me back. "Not so fast."

"Oh?"

"How are you? I can’t wait until we’re mated so I won’t have to ask."

"I don’t know. Sad. Confused. Maybe guilty."

"It wasn’t your fault." He cupped my face.

"Yeah." I avoided his gaze.

"I mean it. Keep your head up today. I’m here if you need me."

"Thank you."

Sebastian leaned in, pressing a soft kiss to my lips that sent a tingle through them.

"Felt that, did you?" He smirked as I touched my lips.

"Yeah. What was that?"

"The mate bond. I’ve felt it since yesterday."

"I don’t turn eighteen until tomorrow."

"Oliver said he felt a light version of the bond the day before Sophia turned eighteen." His eyes studied mine.

"Oh." A small weight lifted from my chest.

"Oh?" He raised a brow.

"I thought it would hit full force the moment my birthday came. I didn’t realize it built up."

"Neither did I. Oliver said he knew Sophia was his mate the moment he met her. Remember how obsessed he was?"

"Yeah. At my tattoo shop."

"Are you upset?"

"About what?"

"About being my mate?"

"No." I shifted closer until our foreheads touched. "Just processing everything. I wouldn’t have given myself to you if I doubted it."

His arms wrapped around me, pulling me in.

###Chapter 0067

Sebastian's lips brushed against my neck, sending electric currents down my spine. "Such a flawless body," he murmured, his voice thick with desire.

I pushed against his chest, slipping out of bed before he could pull me back. "Not now. I need to shower."

Sophia would be here soon, and I had to be ready. With no robe in sight and Sebastian gone, I grabbed one of his button-ups, slipping it on over my bare skin. I had just pulled on a pair of panties when a knock echoed at the door.

"Hey," I greeted Sophia as I let her in.

"Good, you're fresh out of the shower."

"Yes, ma'am."

She set her bag down, her expression softening. "I'm so sorry about your shop."

"Me too." I sank into a chair, watching as she unpacked her supplies.

Her hands trembled slightly as she spoke. "You and Sebastian, huh?"

"Guess so."

"Luna?"

"Do I get to call you Luna now?"

"Not until tomorrow." She turned me toward the mirror, fingers already working through my damp hair.

"I always knew you were meant to be a Luna."

A small smile tugged at my lips. "I'm glad we get to live together again."

"Me too. I've missed this—missed us."

I squeezed her hand. "Please tell me your makeup is waterproof."

"Bought some yesterday just for this," she said with a watery laugh.

The room fell silent as she worked, the only sound the soft hum of the curling iron. My reflection stared back at me—eyes shadowed, lips pressed tight. None of this felt real. Attending his funeral before we even turned eighteen?

Sebastian and Oliver walked in just as Sophia handed me my dress.

"How's it going?" Sebastian's gaze locked onto what I was wearing—or rather, not wearing—beneath his shirt. Heat flooded my cheeks as his eyes darkened. Oliver immediately went to Sophia, giving us a moment.

"Just about to change."

Sebastian's brow arched, a flicker of hunger in his gaze. "We need to leave soon. You two should get there early to greet everyone."

Nodding, I slipped into the bathroom. His shirt fell open easily, and I stepped into the simple black dress Sophia had chosen—sleeveless, modest, but still hugging my curves. It ended mid-thigh, elegant yet understated. Perfect for a funeral.

Sophia joined me, handing over a pair of heels. "Here."

"Thanks." I slid them on while she changed into a similar dress.

We stood side by side before the mirror—two girls who had grown up together, now facing a loss neither of us had expected.

A soft knock. "Ready?" Oliver's voice was gentle.

"No," I admitted weakly as Sophia opened the door.

She sagged into Oliver's arms, a single tear escaping. I felt numb as I stepped out. Sebastian waited, dressed in all black, sleeves rolled up to reveal his forearms. His hair was perfectly styled, beard freshly trimmed.

"You okay?" he asked.

"I guess." I grabbed my purse, fingers tightening around the strap.

"Let's go," Oliver said, guiding Sophia out.

Sebastian lingered, waiting for me. Just as I moved to follow, he caught my wrist, pulling me into a quick, searing kiss. "Stay strong," he murmured before releasing me.

"You girls take this car," Oliver said, opening the driver's side door for me. Sophia wasn't in any state to drive.

Sebastian leaned in through the window. "Warriors are stationed along the route. You'll be safe. We'll leave in ten."

The engine purred to life. Sophia waved at Oliver while I mouthed bye to Sebastian. Silence filled the car, heavy and suffocating. Through the trees, I caught glimpses of our warriors—silent sentinels watching over us.

Grayson and Nathan stood waiting as we pulled up. "Evelyn..." Sophia's voice cracked.

"I know."

The black tent loomed ahead, smoke curling into the sky. I reached for her hand, squeezing tight.

Grayson and Nathan opened our doors, helping us out. The four of us linked arms as we walked toward the tent, Sophia and me flanked by them—a protective barrier.

Grayson kept me close to his side, a silent reassurance.

And a way to keep Nathan from sparking Oliver's jealousy.

###Chapter 0068

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves as Evelyn and Sebastian stood side by side at the entrance of the memorial tent. One by one, their pack members filed in, filling the space with quiet murmurs and shared grief. Liam's body rested at the front, draped in the ceremonial colors of their pack, making Evelyn focus her gaze determinedly toward the back.

Only when the last of the attendees had arrived did Oliver appear, flanked by the ranking members of Sebastian's pack. Without hesitation, Oliver went straight to Sophia, who collapsed into his arms, her shoulders shaking with renewed sobs. Sebastian approached Evelyn, pressing a gentle kiss to her cheek.

"You holding up?" His voice was low, meant only for her.

"Barely," she admitted, her fingers twisting in the fabric of her dress.

Sebastian shook hands with Nathan and Grayson, exchanging quiet words with each. When Sophia finally released Oliver, he did the same. Evelyn's entire body tensed as her father and Margaret approached with Liam's father. The older man froze when his eyes landed on Evelyn, his face twisting with unspoken accusations. Sebastian moved protectively behind her.

Alexander leaned in to whisper something to Liam's father, who lowered his head and walked stiffly past Evelyn without a word. Margaret, however, showed no such restraint.

"How dare you show your face here," Margaret hissed, hands planted on her hips.

"That's enough," Grayson stepped between them, his voice a dangerous growl.

Margaret's eyes flashed with malice. "He won't always be here to protect you." With one last glare, she stalked away.

"Maybe I should wait outside," Evelyn murmured to Grayson.

"No." His jaw was set, eyes burning with barely contained fury. "You're sitting with us."

"Grayson—"

Sebastian placed a steadying hand on Evelyn's shoulder. "She stays."

Swallowing hard, Evelyn gripped Grayson's hand as they walked down the aisle. She kept her chin high, though every step felt like walking through quicksand. Alexander, Margaret, and Liam's family occupied the left side; their group took the right. Once seated, Alexander rose to speak.

"Today we honor one of our own," his voice carried through the tent, strong despite the grief lining his face. "Taken too soon, but dying as the hero he always was. Liam was a son, a brother to many of us, and a friend who touched countless lives. His bravery will continue to inspire us all. For his sacrifice, he will be honored with an Ash Elm Tree."

The crowd erupted in approval, howls and cheers mixing in the autumn air. "The family has invited anyone who wishes to share their memories to come forward."

Grayson stood, adjusting his suit jacket with deliberate movements. At the podium, he cleared his throat before speaking. "Liam was my brother in every way that matters. We grew up together—learning to fight, to lead, to live as men of our pack. He stood by me, and by Evelyn. The three of us were inseparable. Then Sophia came along, and later Nathan. We weren't just friends—we were family."

His voice broke slightly before he continued. "Liam was the brother who carried your burdens, the warrior who stood between danger and those he loved. If Liam was near, I knew Evelyn and Sophia were safe. He proved that truth one final time." Grayson's hands clenched on the podium. "Liam was the kind of man who'd sacrifice himself without hesitation to save someone he cared about. We'd actually talked about this—how we'd want to go, if it came to that. Both of us said in battle, saving a packmate. And that's exactly what Liam did. He died saving my sister. Someone he loved."

A single tear tracked down Grayson's face. "I have no doubt that if he were here right now, he'd say he'd do it all over again. Because of his sacrifice, I owe him everything. And I swear on my life—I will find who did this, and I will end them. Liam, my brother... I love you."

The tent erupted in howls of agreement and mourning as Grayson returned to his seat. Evelyn reached for his hand, squeezing tightly as the ceremony continued around them, the weight of loss and vengeance heavy in the air.

###Chapter 0069

Grayson stepped aside. Nathan shook his head firmly while I clung to Sophia for dear life. After a tense moment, Grayson lifted the torch and set the wood beneath Liam's body ablaze. The flames erupted instantly, making me recoil. Grayson returned to our group and sat down. Soft music played as we watched Liam turn to ashes.

Father remained seated for about ten minutes before standing and addressing the gathering. "Food and drinks will be served in the backyard of the pack house. The family invites everyone to join in continuing to celebrate Liam's life."

People began rising and heading toward the backyard. Most departed, though a few lingered. Only Liam's father remained, staring into the fire. Drawing a deep breath, I prepared to do something either incredibly brave or monumentally foolish.

"Excuse me, sir." My entire body trembled as I approached him. I could feel countless eyes boring into my back.

"What?" His gaze burned with unmistakable hatred. Definitely foolish then.

"I want to express how deeply sorry I am. Liam was someone I admired and loved like a brother. Though my pain can't compare to yours, I want you to know I carry this guilt and will live with it forever."

I inhaled sharply as his glare intensified. "And because of who I am, you probably haven't been able to express your anger properly. I'm giving you permission now. Yell, scream, curse—say whatever you need to say. This is your chance."

Shock flashed across his face. The entire clearing seemed to hold its breath as he stood.

"Young lady, I watched you grow up. I know your character. I've wanted nothing more than to do exactly what you're offering. My boy loved you, and that love killed him. You poisoned his mind, broke his heart, and stole his last breath. I know you'll carry this burden. I understand pack hierarchy, but if he hadn't loved you so deeply, he'd never have taken that bullet. Forgiveness may come one day—but not today." He turned and walked away. Silent tears streamed down my face as I maintained eye contact until he disappeared.

Just as I turned back toward my friends, searing pain exploded across my cheek. The unexpected blow sent me stumbling. Strong arms caught me before I hit the ground.

"Damn it, Margaret!" Father roared. He had Margaret's arm in a vice grip. She smirked at me with pure malice. Something warm trickled down my chin.

"That bitch deserved it."

I felt my eyes darken. "Tomorrow, when we're equals and I'm no longer part of this pack—"

"Sebastian, get her out of here!" Grayson shouted as my claws extended.

"I order you to the cells!" Father commanded. "Take her, Grayson." Sebastian tried moving me, but I wouldn't budge. That witch was going down. Sebastian finally hoisted me over his shoulder. At least I got a clear view of her kicking and screaming as they dragged her to the cells. Nathan assisted while Sebastian's pack members followed us to the vehicles.

"Evelyn!" Sebastian barked sharply, snapping my focus from Margaret to him. "Breathe, sweetheart. Relax your body." He pinned me against the car, his hands rubbing my arms in soothing motions that left strange tingles in their wake.

"I'll kill her."

"It's alright."

"You promised she'd never hit me again."

"I know. I'm sorry—I was too far away to stop it this time."

###Chapter 0070

My body finally relaxed as I felt my eyes return to their normal state. "Yeah." I wasn't sure how to respond to that.

"Ready to go home?"

"Yes." No matter who my mate turned out to be, I would never call this place home. I was already mentally packing my bags, ready to leave and never look back.

Sebastian grabbed a tissue from somewhere—I hadn’t even seen where—and began dabbing at my lip. "It's fine. Not deep enough to matter," I muttered as he inspected it.

"SEBASTIAN! WAIT!" Grayson shouted as he and Nathan sprinted toward us.

"I'm so sorry, Evelyn." Grayson reached us first. Sebastian stepped aside, letting Grayson examine my face.

"F*CK!" Nathan roared, looking like he was about to punch the nearest tree.

"I'm fine." I reached out and grabbed Nathan’s arm, trying to calm him down.

"He was completely out of line saying that. I'll tal—"

"You will do no such thing!" I cut him off sharply. "That man just lost his son. He has every right to feel the way he does. Liam literally jumped in front of a bullet to save me. If yelling at me helps him grieve, then I can take it. Besides, we all know him. In a week, he’ll call and apologize."

"Scarlett…" Nathan started.

"No, Nathan. Listen to me, both of you. I allowed him to speak to me like that. He’s hurting, and I’m not fragile. My heart will heal. Right now, we need to stand together and find a new normal. Who knows who you two might end up mating tomorrow? You have a pack to think about. Set your pain aside and be the leaders they need. Grieve at night, but right now, they need to see you strong. The pack needs to know you can still protect them, provide for them, and make sound decisions. Go back there and hold your heads high. You two are the future of this pack. Sophia and I are leaving. Even if Sebastian isn’t my mate, I’m packing my bags, and I won’t be coming back. You can’t ask me to. You have everything you need right here." I pressed my hand over their hearts. Both of them stared up at the sky as I lectured them.

"I hope whoever I mate is half the Luna you would’ve been," Grayson murmured before wrapping his arms around me.

"Damn, Scarlett. You do have a heart after all," Nathan joked as I hugged him too. Behind me, Sebastian shifted impatiently, but I ignored him.

"Don’t tell anyone," I said, trying to scowl but failing as a small smile slipped out. "I won’t be far. Close enough to come kick your asses if you need it."

"Wouldn’t doubt it," Nathan said, already walking away.

"Grayson. I love you."

"Sh*t, Scarlett. Did you actually say it first without me forcing you?" He grinned as he hugged me tighter.

"Don’t get used to it." I rolled my eyes dramatically.

"What about tomorrow?" Grayson asked.

"I’m grabbing my dresses and taking them to Sebastian’s. We’ll get ready there and come over together."

"Damn, so I won’t be there when you two finally figure it out?" Grayson frowned.

"I’m not avoiding him all day just so you can watch us kiss that night."

"It’s a magical moment…" Grayson teased.

"I hope whoever you mate with kicks your ass." I shook my head in exasperation.

"Doubtful."

Turning to Sebastian, I said, "I’ll be right back. Going to grab my dresses."

"Need help?"

"I’ll go with her. I need to get mine too, I guess," Sophia chimed in.

"I’m going with you both. She might be in a cell, but still," Oliver grumbled. Grayson frowned but didn’t argue.

Sebastian’s POV

"How is she really?" I hated that I had to ask. This damn bond needed to hurry up and snap into place already.

"I don’t know how she’s still standing," Grayson admitted, his voice heavy. "Has she even asked about the meeting yet?"

###Chapter 0071

Damn this man. Was there anything Sebastian didn't know about me? "No. She hasn't asked, and I haven't tried to tell her."

"She'll probably ask this afternoon."

"Do you want to be there when we tell her?" I asked. Accepting their strange connection was easier said than done. It wasn’t jealousy—just frustration that he could read her so effortlessly while I was still struggling. I wanted to understand her like that too.

"Whatever you want, man. If you think I should be there, I will be. If not, I trust you can handle whatever she throws at you." I appreciated his answer.

"I’ll call if things get out of hand."

"Alright. I’ll keep my phone close. Just a suggestion—I know times aren’t safe, but taking her somewhere quiet to watch the stars tonight might help her relax before tomorrow. Or do anything, really."

Was he seriously giving me advice on how to calm her down so I could claim her when the bond snapped into place? I was both impressed and irritated. He didn’t know I’d already done it twice. The second time, she had been much more at ease.

"Thanks. I’ll keep that in mind."

We shook hands just as the girls returned, both grinning while Oliver shook his head. I wasn’t sure I wanted to know what they’d done to him.

Oliver took their dresses and carefully placed them in the trunk before telling Evelyn and Sophia to get in the car. Her body language screamed don’t touch me—angled toward the window, chin resting on her hand. As much as I wanted to hold her, I just drove.

Mentally, I knew she still had doubts about us being mates. Emotionally, it stung. Maybe Grayson was right. Tonight needed to be special. Pulling out my phone, I got to work.

Evelyn’s POV

There was something final about a funeral. Before, I kept expecting Liam to walk through the door. After, the acceptance settled in. It would be strange living in a world without him. He had always been there—protecting me, loving me.

As we drove, I felt like I was leaving that world behind and stepping into something new. First, I needed to get out of this damn dress.

The second we arrived, I beelined for Sebastian’s room to change. I knew he was following, but I was on a mission. Still, I left the door open for him.

While digging through my bag for clothes, he walked past me, pulling his shirt free. Despite my best efforts, my eyes caught a glimpse of his sculpted back—and the stunning tattoo I’d inked there.

Needing space, I bolted into the bathroom. Staring at my reflection, I barely recognized myself—split lip, dark circles, a sullen expression. Taking a deep breath, I decided it was time to pull myself together.

Changing into shorts and a workout top, I was ready to move. My muscles ached, but I wasn’t stopping. Not that I’d let Sebastian tell me no—but it was time to face him.

When I stepped out, he was sitting on the edge of the bed in shorts and a tank top.

"What are your plans for the day?" I asked.

"Cleared my schedule. Whatever you want." He leaned forward, elbows on his knees, his gaze sweeping over me in a way that made my skin heat.

"I want to clean up my shop."

Mrs. Smith Author

Thank you all for reading! Everything about Margaret will come together soon!

###Chapter 0072

"Alright, let's go."

"Seriously?"

"Dead serious."

"Just like that?" It felt too easy, like a trick.

"What did you expect? For me to chain you to the bed?" Sebastian stood and closed the distance between us.

"Well, I expected some resistance," I admitted slowly.

He exhaled sharply, leaning down until his breath brushed my ear. "When I chain you to that bed, Evelyn, you won’t be complaining. You’ll be screaming my name until sunrise."

My thighs clenched at the promise in his voice. He pulled back, smirking at my reaction, then strode toward the door. "Coming?"

"More than one way," I muttered under my breath as I passed him.

A deep chuckle rumbled in his chest before his palm landed on my ass with a sharp smack. My glare only made his smirk widen.

We climbed into his car, and as soon as the engine roared to life, I turned to him. "Why are you so calm about cleaning up the shop? I thought I’d have to fight you on this."

He shrugged, eyes on the road. "I know how much it means to you. Plus, I already arranged for a dumpster and volunteers."

My jaw dropped. "You organized this?"

He reached over, nudging my chin up with his knuckle. "I’ll have that mouth busy later. But don’t give me all the credit—Grayson helped."

"Help with what?"

"Demolition." His grip tightened on the wheel. "Nothing’s salvageable, Evelyn. You’ll have to rebuild from scratch. Change the layout, the design—whatever you want."

I swallowed hard. "Sebastian, I don’t have that kind of money. My dad won’t pay for it, and neither will I."

"Just wait," he murmured, like he knew something I didn’t.

The shop had been my escape, my dream. But if Sebastian was my mate, would I even need to run? Still, I couldn’t set up shop on pack territory—humans and outsiders weren’t welcome there.

When we pulled up, the caution tape was gone. People bustled in and out, hauling debris.

"What’s all this?" I whispered.

"Evelyn!" Audrey sprinted toward me, her forehead glistening with sweat. "You’re here! We have a surprise!"

"We?" I shot Sebastian a look, but he just leaned against the car, arms crossed, watching.

Audrey dragged me forward. The place was swarming with people—sweeping glass, tearing down walls, gutting the bathroom.

"These are…"

"Everyone you’ve ever helped," Audrey said, pressing a folded paper into my hand.

I opened it. A bank statement—$6,523.00.

"What is this?"

"Your money. All the tips you refused at the bar, all the jobs you did for free. We saved it. We knew how badly you wanted this."

My throat tightened. Faces I recognized smiled at me as they passed.

Sebastian’s hand settled on the small of my back, warm and steady. "Come inside," he murmured, guiding me through the door.

Dust hung in the air, mingling with the scent of sweat. The walls were stripped to studs, the bathroom demolished, the flooring half-ripped up.

"Should be done in a few hours," Audrey said, grinning. "What do you think?"

"I… don’t know what to say."

"Say thank you," Sebastian whispered against my ear.

"Th-thank you!" I managed, still dazed.

Audrey tugged me back outside to her car. "Take these." She shoved a stack of samples into my arms—flooring, paint swatches, cabinet finishes. "Pick what you want so I can order everything. And think about the layout—do you want to change it?"

###Chapter 0073

"I'll handle the design," I said as Sebastian took the samples from me.

"Perfect. Get it to me when you can. No pressure, but sooner would be great." Audrey clapped her hands together, beaming at me.

"You're literally a lifesaver," I breathed, completely in awe.

"Anything for you. I owe you big time. This is the least I can do."

"Are you sure you don’t need any help?"

"Nope, just tell us how you want it."

"Come on, we can work on this in my office," Sebastian said, turning toward his car.

"Okay, well… Call me if you need anything."

"Will do," Audrey waved as I headed toward Sebastian's car.

"I just…" Sitting in the passenger seat, I fidgeted.

"Evelyn, look at me." His voice was firm, making it hard to ignore.

"Let them handle it. It's okay to let people take care of you sometimes."

"It feels wrong," I muttered, shivering as Sebastian started the engine.

"Get used to it," he grumbled.

"Why should I?" I crossed my arms, my stubbornness flaring up.

"Because I said so." Short, direct, and infuriatingly final.

"And what you say goes?" I challenged.

"On this, yes."

"We’ll see about that," I huffed.

Sebastian looked like he wanted to argue but just shook his head. For some reason, that made guilt twist in my chest.

"What exactly did you and Grayson discuss with Dominic about trashing my shop?"

Sebastian’s grip on the steering wheel tightened. "For now, nothing. With your birthday and the school events coming up, we’re keeping things low-key."

"What the hell?"

"If you’d let me finish," he cut in sharply. "I was going to say we’re planning to return the favor. They own a garage in the next city over. We’re paying them a visit."

An eye for an eye. "That’s not enough," I hissed, my blood boiling.

"Oh, it will be. That garage is their main source of income. Think of it as their pride and joy."

"How did I not know they owned that?"

"It’s under an alias in a city we never go to. We found out by accident years ago and kept it quiet for the right moment. Now, Dominic attacked you. This won’t just be payback—it’ll be a declaration."

"I don’t want a war started over me."

"Too late, princess. This isn’t just about you. It’s about the disrespect he showed your father’s pack—and mine."

"How did it disrespect yours?"

"Because whether you accept it or not, you’re my mate. That makes you the future Luna of my pack. We don’t tolerate anyone disrespecting our Luna."

I knew arguing was pointless, but I couldn’t help myself. "It was a scare tactic. He wants me, so he’s flexing his dominance. A 'look what I can do' kind of move."

"Good thing we don’t scare easily," Sebastian growled, his patience thinning.

"You realize having me as a mate means I’ll question you when I don’t like what I hear. I won’t be sidelined. I will be heard."

"Oh, I figured that out the second I met you."

"When did you first think we were mates?"

"After I kissed you at the club."

We pulled up to the pack house. Everything looked normal—people milling about, a group of guys, including Ethan, lounging outside with doughnuts. They all watched as we got out, Sebastian carrying the samples.

"Don’t want to break a nail, Ms. Evelyn," Ethan called out snidely.

"I’m not the one who should be worried about nails," I shot back. "Last I checked, your ass wasn’t the one who got wrecked in training."

###Chapter 0074

Ethan tossed his half-eaten bagel aside as his packmates erupted in laughter. "Ethan, twenty laps around the training field," Sebastian commanded, his voice a mix of exasperation and amusement.

"Yes, Alpha." The young wolf muttered before sprinting off. Sophia and I followed Sebastian into his office.

"Seems you've developed a talent for motivating our younger members," Sebastian remarked dryly, shutting the door behind us.

"Technically, I'm still considered young too. Just giving peer advice." I flopped into the chair opposite his desk with a shrug. Sebastian's lips twitched but he remained silent.

He grabbed a blueprint from his drawer. "Let's discuss the shop layout." His pen sketched the current floor plan. "What modifications do you want?"

"I need a private office behind reception. Keeping the bathroom in its current location but expanding it slightly. A separate room for ink storage - doesn't need to be large. And the sterilization area requires more cabinet space."

"Why not add another workstation?" Sebastian tapped the blueprint thoughtfully. "You could hire another artist, expand your business."

The suggestion caught me off guard. "That...actually makes sense. We could fit three stations along the west wall with half partitions. Add curtain rods above for privacy if needed."

Sebastian's phone buzzed incessantly. He responded to some messages, ignored others. My fingers itched to ask, but it wasn't my place. "Happy with these changes?"

A knock interrupted us. Sebastian pressed the intercom. The door clicked open. "Nice security system," I noted approvingly.

"Lunch delivery, Alpha." A kitchen staff member entered balancing trays.

"Set it on the coffee table, please." I wandered over to inspect our meal. As the staff turned to leave, the door swung open again.

"Oh good, that homewrecker's gone." Isabella strutted in wearing nothing but a belted trench coat. The kitchen worker's eyes bulged, darting between us.

Popping a grape into my mouth, I considered my options. Sebastian reclined in his chair, smirking. "What do you want, Isabella?"

"You told me to come by your office. But you're always busy or absent in the mornings." She twirled, coat flaring open. "Like what you see?"

"Can't tell from this angle. Turn around." My crisp command made her jump. She hastily cinched the coat shut, glaring daggers at me.

"What are you doing here?" she hissed.

"Planning where to put my desk after becoming Luna tomorrow. Now, about that modeling session..." My power surged, wrapping around her like invisible ropes. Sebastian watched, amused, as I casually ate another grape.

Isabella's coat flew open against her will, revealing scandalous lingerie. Rage simmered in my veins, but I kept my expression neutral.

"The cups seem a bit...empty. Poor fit." I selected another grape.

"Sebastian loved this set last time," she sneered.

"Let's get a second opinion." I yanked her by the hair, dragging her like the bitch she was to the group of warriors lounging outside. She tumbled onto the gravel.

"Need help, Luna Evelyn?" they asked, eyeing the disheveled Isabella.

"Actually yes. She thinks this lingerie makes her look good enough to parade before Alpha Sebastian. What's your verdict?"

Their collective disgust was immediate. "Pathetic," one spat.

"Whoever mates her deserves pity."

"Nobody wants a pack slut."

Sebastian's arm encircled my waist. "Had enough humiliation, Isabella?" His Alpha voice boomed across the courtyard.

###Chapter 0075

"Y-yes, Alpha."

Isabella rushed past me, a single tear streaking down her cheek as she fled.

"Thank you, boys," I murmured before turning back toward the office. Sebastian followed, this time locking the door behind us.

"So, where were we?" I exhaled, still struggling to rein in my simmering anger.

Sebastian gripped my arm and yanked me against the wall, his body pressing hard into mine. His lips crashed against my own, the kiss deep and demanding. Tiny sparks danced across my skin, electrifying the air between us.

Pinning my wrists above my head, he trembled with restraint.

"You're lucky we have responsibilities today," he growled, finally pulling away.

I smirked, meeting his heated gaze. "Why so worked up?" Deliberately, I bit my lower lip before slowly dragging my tongue across it. The way his body tensed at the sight sent a thrill through me.

"That was insanely hot."

"Oh? You mean like the view you got of Isabella?"

Wrong move. His fist slammed into the wall beside my head—so close I felt the rush of air. To my credit, I didn’t flinch.

"Never say that again," he snarled. "You’re mine. She’s nothing." His eyes burned with barely contained fury.

I placed my hands on his chest and leaned into him, catching him off guard. I wasn’t usually the one to initiate.

Then, with a whisper against his ear, I teased, "Yes, Alpha," before flicking my tongue along the shell of it.

"Damn it, Evelyn!" He shoved away, glaring. "I’m trying to keep my hands off you, and you’re taunting me?"

"So you can throw me against a wall and have your way, but I can’t return the favor?" I challenged, hands planted on my hips.

"Exactly. Now sit. We have work to do."

I couldn’t suppress my grin. "Not hungry first?" I let the double meaning linger.

He groaned. "Fine. Lunch."

With more force than necessary, he dropped onto the couch and unpacked our food. Not wanting to push him further—yet—I sat and ate quietly, my thoughts drifting back to the project.

This was unfolding like a dream. I’d considered expanding before, but never like this.

"What’s on your mind?" Sebastian asked, studying me.

"Are you really going to let me keep tattooing after I become your Luna?"

"Evelyn, being Luna isn’t a prison sentence. It’s a role, a way of life. Think of it like a career—you can still have passions. Besides, you thrive on being busy." He leaned forward. "Do you realize the influence you’ll have? Want an art studio for teens? Done. A massive library? Just ask. This entire pack will look to you to shape their future. Everything you’ve done for schools and kids—you’ll do it on a grander scale. You’ll still be helping people."

Well… when he put it like that. "Oh."

"Is that why you’ve been resisting?"

"I always dreamed of traveling. Seeing the world. Anything was better than my father’s pack. I just… wanted to choose for myself."

"Would you choose traveling over me?"

"No." I exhaled. "Let me explain—and really listen. I’ve only ever told Grayson this. Growing up in that hell… all I wanted was escape. Staying wasn’t an option. Everyone said Liam would be my mate—since I was eleven. So, naturally, I spent more time with him. But as things got worse… Grayson and Liam could only do so much. By fourteen, it was unbearable. My arm got broken. I could’ve graduated early, but that meant online classes—more time with Margaret. So, I stayed in school."

I set my fork down. "Every time they failed to protect me, my wanderlust grew. I saved money, opened my shop. Eventually, I questioned if I even wanted Liam as a mate. Being with him meant staying—living near Margaret. Meeting you showed me another life. One where I don’t have to look over my shoulder. That’s what I want. You give me that here. I think I can be happy—as long as I’m still me, still tattooing. But I still want to see the world."

Sebastian’s gaze softened. "Then we’ll see it. Together."

###Chapter 0076

"So this is your safe choice." Sebastian's voice carried a wounded edge.

"It's not that simple. Yes, you make me feel safe. I am safe here. But you—you're not just a safe option. You're a risk. You could destroy me—mentally, emotionally, physically. The idea of being mated terrifies me because you’ll see everything. My fears, my flaws, my deepest insecurities. You’re the unknown, and my instincts are screaming at me to run. But my heart… my heart wants to stay. To give you that power over me and trust you won’t shatter it."

"You're afraid of being loved."

"Love isn’t always enough. My father loved me—it wasn’t enough. Grayson loves me—it wasn’t enough. Liam loved me, and now he’s dead. What if you love me one day and it gets you killed too? I’m not worth that."

Sebastian was silent for a long moment before standing abruptly. He scooped me up effortlessly and carried me to the couch, settling me onto his lap and trapping my legs beneath his so I couldn’t escape. "You are worth loving. I wish you could see yourself the way I do. I know I can’t convince you right now, but after tomorrow, I’ll spend every damn day proving it to you."

His fingers cradled my face as he pressed the gentlest kiss to my lips before pulling me into his chest. I fit there perfectly, as if my body had been made to mold against his.

"Should we keep working on the design?" he murmured.

"Sure." I didn’t want to move, but I did when he finally released my legs. Sebastian grabbed the design books and spread them across the coffee table, keeping our snacks within reach.

"What kind of flooring do you want?"

"I’m thinking light olive or sage green walls. The flooring should be neutral—more gray than brown, but not too dark."

"Like this?" He flipped to a glossy sample.

"Too shiny. I don’t want anything that shows dust or scratches easily."

"This one?" He tapped a textured gray with faint brown undertones, the kind with built-in imperfections to disguise wear.

"Perfect. How much per square foot?"

"Don’t worry about it. Everything here is within your budget. Even if you pick the most expensive options, it’s covered. Audrey is a genius. No wonder she was your assistant."

"I have a talent for picking the right people."

Sebastian studied me, his gaze sharp. "What’s on your mind?"

"Will you really let me keep tattooing after I become your Luna?"

"Evelyn, being Luna isn’t a prison sentence. It’s a role—a way of life. Think of it like a career. You can still have passions outside of it. Besides, you thrive when you’re busy. Do you realize the influence you’ll have here? If you want an art studio for teens, you can make it happen. A massive library? Just say the word. This entire pack will look to you to shape their future. All those projects you did for schools and kids? You’ll do them on a much larger scale. You’ll still be helping people."

When he put it like that… "Oh."

"Is that why you’ve been resisting this so much?"

"I always dreamed of traveling. Seeing the world. Anything was better than staying in my father’s pack. I just wanted the freedom to choose."

"Would you choose traveling over me?"

"No." I exhaled, gathering my thoughts. "I need you to understand something I’ve only ever told Grayson. Growing up in that house… all I wanted was to escape. Staying wasn’t an option. As we got older, everyone assumed Liam would be my mate. I was told that since I was eleven. So I spent more time with him. But as things got worse… Grayson and Liam could only do so much. By sixteen, it was unbearable. My arm was broken. I could’ve tested out of high school, but that meant online college—more time with Margaret. So I stayed. Every time Liam or Grayson failed to protect me, my desire to leave grew stronger. I saved up, opened my shop. Eventually, I even questioned whether I wanted Liam as a mate. If we’d been together, I would’ve left him to travel. No hesitation. Being his mate meant staying—living with Margaret. Then I met you, and for the first time, I saw a future that didn’t mean running. That doesn’t mean I don’t still want to see the world. But what I want most is a life where I don’t have to look over my shoulder. You give me that here. I think I could be happy—as long as I can still be me, still tattoo. But I still want to travel."

Sebastian’s thumb brushed my cheek. "Then we’ll travel."

###Chapter 0077

"Do you have Audrey's contact information?"

"I already gave it to him," Sophia replied quickly. The way they exchanged glances told me they were hiding something.

"Care to share what's going on?" I raised an eyebrow.

"Stop interrogating us! I want to go swimming!" Sophia actually stomped her foot, her impatience bubbling over.

"Easy there. I don’t even have a swimsuit."

"I got you one!" She triumphantly held up a shopping bag. I eyed her skeptically, but she just rolled her eyes and yanked my arm.

"Stop overthinking it. Let’s go!"

"Have fun!" Oliver called after us as we headed out.

"Help! I’m being kidnapped!" I fake-protested, but Sebastian only smirked, completely unbothered.

"You’ll thank me later," Sophia insisted.

We retreated to her room to change. "Here’s yours." She tossed me a scandalously tiny bikini. Once I squeezed into it, I had to admit—it had great support, but the neckline plunged dangerously low, and the back barely covered anything. Sophia, meanwhile, wore a neon-yellow string bikini, while mine was sleek black.

"Oliver approved this?"

"Not exactly," she admitted with a laugh. "But I won the argument."

"Nice. Towels?"

"Right here! Now let’s move!"

She threw me an oversized t-shirt and flip-flops before dragging me out the door. "Where’s this pool?"

"Just down the road. Public one."

"Fantastic," I deadpanned as we climbed into the golf cart. Sophia drove like a maniac, forcing me to grip the seat for dear life.

"I’m driving back," I muttered as I practically tumbled out.

"Stop being dramatic!" She rolled her eyes. "Oliver won’t let me drive again if you keep this up."

"Now, bathroom fixtures," Sebastian said, ignoring my earlier question.

"That vanity, paired with that shower. Same flooring as the rest. And I want that mirror. Duplicate the cabinets for the sterilization room and my office—top and bottom."

"Well, damn. Alright." I pointed to a dark blue vanity with clean lines, matching my aesthetic. The shower had a black metal frame and glass doors.

"I know what I like," I shrugged, finishing my meal just as the office door swung open. Sophia and Oliver walked in.

"How’s it going?" Sophia asked.

"Just wrapped up designing my shop!" I grinned.

"Perfect. Now let’s go lounge by the pool."

"Sounds good. You two enjoy," Sebastian said. "I’ll send these plans to Audrey, and Oliver and I have work to finish. We’ll catch up for dinner."

###Chapter 0078

"Poor boy. Perhaps I'll offer him a position."

"He's quite talented with sketches. You should see his artwork."

"I might just do that." I could use someone to tidy up the shop. If this truly is my home now, I have plenty of savings to help him out.

After that, no one else approached us. A few girls glanced our way, but none came over. Honestly, it disappointed me. Back in my father's pack, people always greeted me warmly. Maybe they're intimidated? Some Lunas might prefer solitude, but that wasn't me.

"Oh, time to go!" Sophia exclaimed, checking her phone.

"The boys aren't meeting us here?"

"Nope. We're going to them... sort of."

"Sort of?"

"We need to shower and get ready. They've planned a date for us."

"Ah, so this whole outing was just to get me out of the house while they set up."

"Don't act surprised. You saw this coming from miles away."

"I did." Laughing, we climbed into the cart. "Drive slower," I warned Sophia.

"Yeah, yeah." She rolled her eyes but obeyed, driving much more carefully this time. Thank goodness—Oliver was waiting outside when we arrived.

"How was her driving?" he asked me.

"My lunch stayed down!" I joked, darting inside.

"Traitor!" Sophia yelled. I blew her a playful kiss before disappearing into the house.

I sprinted up to the bedroom, just in time to see Sebastian pulling his shirt on. "Hey!" I slammed the door shut behind me.

"What's the rush?"

"Had to escape Sophia. I ratted her out to Oliver. She's a nightmare behind the wheel!" I laughed, heading to my bag—only to find it empty. "Where are my clothes?"

"In the closet. Where they belong." Sebastian shrugged like it was nothing.

I marched into the walk-in closet and froze. All my belongings were now neatly arranged beside his.

"What the hell?"

"Grayson handled it. He had help moving everything so you wouldn’t have to waste time packing. I had a maid organize it."

Mixed emotions swirled inside me. On one hand, I appreciated not having to do it myself. On the other, it felt... forced.

"Oh."

"You don’t like it?" Sebastian’s voice was cautious.

"...No, I mean—yes, it’s just... it could’ve—maybe—" I fumbled before sighing. "Yes. Thank you."

"This overwhelmed you." He stated it plainly.

"Yes."

"You may not believe we’re mates, but I do." His tone was sharp with frustration. Without another word, he turned and walked out.

My heart sank, regret flooding me. I felt awful. Grabbing fresh clothes, I stepped into the shower, letting the scalding water turn my skin red. Was it shame? Probably.

Once dressed, I slipped into a flattering sundress and did my makeup—nothing dramatic, just enough to look nice for Sebastian. Strapping on my sandals, I went searching for him.

He wasn’t in his office or the lobby. I knocked on Sophia and Oliver’s door.

"Looking gorgeous!" Sophia greeted me.

"Is Sebastian here?"

"No. Isn’t he with you?"

"No. Can you link him and find out?"

"Sure. What happened?" Oliver asked.

"He moved all my clothes into his closet."

"Ah. Yeah, that probably didn’t go over well." Sophia winced, studying my face.

"What? Why?" Oliver looked baffled.

###Chapter 0079

The swing came to a gentle stop as Sebastian waited for me to climb on. His hands gripped the chains tightly as we began swaying again. "I owe you an apology," I murmured, looping my arm through his. "You did something incredibly thoughtful and I reacted poorly. I truly appreciate your gesture." Resting my head against his shoulder, I inhaled his familiar cedar scent.

Silence stretched between us like an unbridgeable chasm. "Sebastian?" My voice cracked. When he remained motionless, I exhaled sharply and stood abruptly. Pressing a featherlight kiss to his stubbled cheek, I turned on my heel before he could see the tears welling in my eyes.

Sophia and Oliver emerged from the packhouse just as my vision blurred. "Evelyn?" Oliver called.

"Enjoy your evening," I choked out, descending the porch steps with forced steadiness. Their voices carried through the twilight air.

"What the hell, Sebastian?" Oliver's incredulous tone made my stomach clench.

Sophia's sharper voice followed. "After everything she's given you - more than she's ever given anyone - you're really going to let this ruin tonight?"

The accusations stung because they were justified. Opening up had never come easily to me, yet here I was sabotaging the best thing in my life. My feet carried me aimlessly as dusk painted the sky in bruised purples. The pack compound lay deserted, most members gathered for supper.

A small playground beckoned from the edge of the clearing. Settling onto a weathered swing, I let the evening breeze rock me gently. Tomorrow's planned departure would come sooner than anticipated - just not under the circumstances I'd imagined. Crunching footsteps approached, and my heart plummeted when Sophia's floral perfume reached me first.

"Hey, trouble." She sank onto the adjacent swing, her fingers intertwining with mine.

"I really messed up this time." My attempt at a smile faltered.

She squeezed my hand. "I understand your walls, but he's been putting in the work."

"So have I," I whispered.

"Nobody sees that clearer than me."

"He won't even accept my apology."

Sophia tilted her head. "He heard you. He just needs processing time."

"Silver lining - this birthday can't possibly be worse than last year's disaster."

"Give him space. He'll come around."

"Before or after I'm exiled tomorrow?" My bitter laugh echoed hollowly.

Her sudden grin made me turn. Following her gaze, I spotted Sebastian's broad silhouette approaching. Sophia embraced me tightly. "Thank you," I breathed into her shoulder.

"Let him in, Evelyn. That man loves you fiercely." Her words lingered as she melted into the shadows.

Sebastian lowered himself onto the swing beside me, the silence stretching taut between us. I felt like a chastened pup awaiting punishment. "If you need to hear me apologize again, I will," I finally offered.

"Come here." His husky command sent shivers down my spine. When I hesitated, he crooked a finger. Rising on unsteady legs, I stood before him. Sebastian parted his knees and guided me onto his lap.

Winding my arms around his neck, I buried my face in the crook of his shoulder. "I'm terrified," I confessed against his skin.

"Of what?" His hands settled on my waist.

"The power you hold over me."

His thoughtful hum vibrated through me.

"You've shown me nothing but kindness, Sebastian. I know I haven't given you everything you want, but you're the only person I've ever let past my defenses. That might not seem like much, but you're dismantling walls I built over a lifetime. You consume my thoughts. My body craves yours. I'm sorry if what I can offer isn't enough."

"Don't." His fingers tightened. "It's not about quantity. It's your lack of faith in our bond."

"That's not true!" I pulled back to meet his stormy gaze. "I actually made a bet about us."

His eyebrow arched. "Excuse me?"

"Ran into Ethan at the pool earlier. He was being his usual obnoxious self, so I wagered he'd owe me a hundred pushups when we complete our mating bond."

"You're serious?"

"Deadly."

"Gambling violates pack rules," he murmured, but the corner of his mouth twitched.

I smirked. "Gonna punish me, Alpha?"

"Off." He gave me a playful shove but caught my hand as I stumbled. "We're leaving."

"Where are we—"

His lips crashed against mine, swallowing the rest of my question. When we broke apart, his eyes burned with possessive fire. "Somewhere I can properly remind you why you'll never doubt us again."

###Chapter 0080
"Cold Supper Under the Stars"

"Let's have dinner under the stars."

"Alright." We walked in comfortable silence toward the golf cart parked in front of the pack house. Sebastian took the wheel, driving us past rows of quiet homes and into the open countryside. As we crested a hill, a twinkling constellation of lights appeared ahead, fireflies dancing like tiny lanterns to guide our way.

When we arrived, I gasped. A lavish picnic setup awaited us—thick blankets strewn with plush pillows, silver trays laden with food, and flickering candles casting a golden glow. "This is incredible!" I exclaimed, perhaps too enthusiastically.

Sebastian shot me an amused glance. "Just relax and be yourself."

"You got angry at me earlier for being myself," I muttered as I stepped out of the cart. He froze for a heartbeat before rounding the vehicle and pressing a tender kiss to my forehead.

Taking my hand, he led me toward the blankets. "Hope you don’t mind cold pasta."

"I’m sure it’s perfect. Thank you for this."

We settled onto the blankets, and Sebastian served us both generous portions. The chicken Alfredo had cooled, but I didn’t complain as I took my first bite.

"I can’t whisk you away to a tropical island or a mountain retreat for your birthday," he admitted, his voice low. "This was the best I could do."

"It’s more than enough. I don’t need extravagance—just something real. Something from you." The awkwardness between us was fading, replaced by a quiet warmth.

We barely finished half the food before pushing the trays aside. "Where did Sophia and Oliver disappear to?" I asked as we lay back, Sebastian’s arm curling beneath my head, pulling me against his chest. The night air was still warm, but I draped a blanket over my legs anyway.

"He planned his own date with her. She thought it was a double date, so..."

"Ah. Well, I wouldn’t have wanted to intrude."

Sebastian tilted my chin up with his finger, his gaze intense. "I’m sorry too."

I answered with a soft kiss before nestling back against him. "What time do we need to head back?"

"We don’t." His eyes were fixed on the sky. "There’s the Big Dipper."

"And a full moon," I murmured, completely at ease. A glance at his phone showed 11:24 p.m. Thirty-six minutes left.

"Are you wearing the red dress tomorrow?"

"Yes."

"Good."

In one fluid motion, Sebastian rolled us over, pinning me beneath him. His hand cradled my face, his eyes burning with unspoken words. Instead of speaking, he claimed my lips in a searing kiss that quickly deepened, his hardened length pressing insistently against me.

"If you want to stop, say it now," he rasped, pulling back just enough to search my eyes.

"Touch me." The plea slipped out before I could stop it.

That was all the permission he needed. His lips crashed back onto mine as his hands pushed my dress up and off in one swift motion. The matching white lace beneath made him growl, his mouth descending to my breast, teeth grazing the peak.

"Oh!" I arched into him as his fingers teased my other nipple. God, I’ve wanted this. I yanked his shirt off, desperate to feel his skin against mine.

Sebastian slowed, dragging his lips back up to my ear. "Fuck, I need you," he whispered, voice rough.

"Then take me."

"The second our bond snaps into place," he vowed, his hand sliding between my thighs, "I won’t hold back. Spread your legs for me."

My body obeyed before my mind could catch up.

A gasp tore from me as he pushed my panties aside, his fingers delving deep while his thumb circled my clit. "Sebastian!" My nails clawed at the blankets beneath us.

###Chapter 0081

"Yes, my love?"

Before I could even respond, Sebastian's tongue traced a slow, deliberate path down my clit. His fingers hooked into the sides of my panties, pulling them off in one swift motion. The moment they were gone, his mouth returned to its sweet torment, sucking and teasing until my entire body trembled with pleasure.

"Oh, God! Sebastian!" I cried out as the first wave crashed over me. My hips arched off the bed, my fingers twisting into the sheets. His tongue didn’t relent, coaxing a second orgasm from me before the first had even faded. My body clenched around his fingers, every nerve alight with sensation.

When he finally pulled back, he kissed his way up my body, letting me taste myself on his lips.

I wanted to return the favor.

With a playful shove, I flipped him onto his back, straddling his waist. His hands settled on my hips, his grip tightening as I leaned down to trace the hard lines of his body with my lips. There was a spot just behind his ear that made him groan, his fingers digging into my skin—not enough to hurt, but enough to make me shiver.

My hair fell into my face, but Sebastian caught it, wrapping the strands around his fist and holding tight. The lower I moved, the more his breathing hitched.

When my tongue grazed the waistband of his shorts, his hips jerked off the bed. The bulge beneath the fabric was intimidating, but I wasn’t backing down. I tugged his pants down just enough to free him, and my breath caught at the sight—thick, hard, and utterly perfect.

Keeping my eyes locked on his, I licked a slow, teasing path from base to tip. His head fell back, a deep groan tearing from his chest as I took him fully into my mouth. No hesitation, no struggle—just pure, sinful pleasure.

"Holy hell, Evelyn," he rasped, his fingers threading through my hair, guiding my movements.

I remembered something I’d seen once—a girl playing with his balls. So I tried it, cupping them gently, rolling them in my palm. The reaction was instant. His entire body tensed, his grip on my hair tightening as he cursed under his breath.

I quickened my pace, hollowing my cheeks, until his hips jerked and he spilled down my throat. I swallowed every drop, then sat back, wiping my lips with a single finger before sucking it clean.

Sebastian watched, his chest heaving, his eyes dark with hunger.

Not done yet, I reached behind me and unhooked my bra, letting it fall away. His cock was already hard again as I tossed the bra aside and crawled up his body, pressing my lips to his in a deep, claiming kiss.

"Damn, woman," he muttered against my mouth before flipping me onto my stomach.

His lips found the back of my neck, sending sparks skittering down my spine. My back arched, pressing my ass against him, and his hands gripped my hips, his claws lightly scraping my skin, leaving goosebumps in their wake.

"Sebastian!"

His phone on the nightstand read 12:04 AM.

It was my birthday.

And the way my body reacted to his touch told me everything I needed to know.

"Turn around," he whispered against my ear.

I rolled onto my back, keeping my eyes closed. My heart pounded so hard I could hear it in my ears. Sebastian settled over me, his weight pressing me into the mattress. My legs wrapped around his waist, and he pinned my hands above my head.

"Open your eyes, beautiful."

"You sure?" My voice trembled.

"Very."

The moment our gazes locked, something inside me snapped into place. The air left my lungs just as he thrust into me, filling me completely. He stilled, letting me adjust, his forehead pressed to mine.

"I’m sorry," he murmured, licking away the tear that escaped my eye.

"Relax. It’ll feel good in a second."

The initial sting faded as he pulled out and pushed back in, his movements slow, controlled.

"Fuck, you’re tight," he groaned, his jaw clenched as he fought to hold back.

"I’m okay," I whispered, my shaking hands cupping his face.

"Are you?"

The concern flooding through our new bond was overwhelming.

He truly cared.

And in that moment, I knew—this was where I belonged.

###Chapter 0082

"Y-yes." The word trembled from my lips, barely audible. My body was alight with sensation—pain melting into pleasure, tension dissolving into surrender. Sebastian felt the shift in me, the way my muscles relaxed beneath his touch, and he responded by moving faster, deeper.

"I can't hold back much longer," he growled, his voice strained. His rhythm intensified, still controlled but undeniably urgent.

A gasp escaped me as pressure coiled tight inside me again. His lips trailed down my neck, finding that sensitive spot near my collarbone. "Sebastian!" My fingers dug into his shoulders, my need for him overwhelming.

"Hold on." His arms tightened around me as he lifted me effortlessly, shifting us so I straddled him, my legs wrapped around his waist. My hips moved instinctively, matching his thrusts with increasing desperation. His hands gripped my waist, guiding me, keeping our rhythm steady.

Then, the urge hit me—sharp, undeniable. My fangs descended before I could stop them.

Sebastian noticed immediately. "Do it," he commanded, his eyes dark with hunger.

I hesitated only a second before he pulled me closer, his body bared for me. My teeth sank into his skin, piercing deep until I tasted blood. He shuddered beneath me, a deep growl rumbling in his chest as his arms locked around me like steel.

I licked the wound clean as my fangs retracted, and then his mouth crashed into mine, possessive and claiming. In that moment, I felt bound to him in ways words couldn't describe.

"I'm close," he warned, his voice rough.

"Then don't hold back," I whispered against his ear.

He didn't.

In one swift motion, he laid me back, his movements turning relentless. The sound of skin against skin filled the air, my moans blending with his growls. My body arched, pleasure cresting as he drove into me with unyielding force.

Then I saw it—his fangs, gleaming in the dim light. I tilted my head, baring my neck in invitation.

"Evelyn..." His voice was strained, almost pained.

"Please," I begged, my body trembling on the edge.

"Look at me."

I forced my eyes open, meeting his gaze. The intensity there stole my breath.

"I love you," he murmured—and then his teeth pierced my flesh.

White-hot pleasure exploded through me as I screamed, my climax crashing over me at the same moment his own release tore through him. His growl vibrated against my skin, sealing the bond between us in a way that left no doubt—we were irrevocably tied.

When he finally pulled back, he licked the wound closed, his touch tender despite the ferocity of what had just passed between us. My body felt weightless, exhaustion creeping in.

"Don't fight it," he murmured, pressing a kiss to my forehead. "Sleep. I'll be here when you wake."

"Love you..." I managed before darkness claimed me.

The first thing I noticed when I woke was the sound—birds singing, leaves rustling in the breeze. Then came the sensation—tiny sparks dancing across my skin, a pleasant tingling that made me sigh.

"You awake?" Sebastian's voice was low, warm against my ear.

"No," I grumbled, burying my face against his chest.

He chuckled. "Happy birthday."

"Thank you."

"We should head back soon. Your father and brother are coming for breakfast." His hand traced lazy circles on my back.

I peeked through my lashes. Sunlight filtered through the trees, golden and soft. "It's too early."

"Do you really want to greet them smelling like sex?"

That got me moving.

I wriggled away, searching for my discarded clothes. "Where are they?"

"Right here." He handed them over with an amused smirk.

Dressing in front of him still felt strange, but after last night, modesty seemed pointless. I pulled on my bra, then my panties, and finally slipped my dress back on.

"We should take everything with us," I said, eyeing the scattered blankets.

"Leave it. Oliver and I will come back for it later when you and Sophia start getting ready for tonight."

"That feels... wrong."

"I did the same for him and Sophia."

I sighed but didn't argue.

###Chapter 0083
"Oliver arranged all this for Sophia?"

I blinked in surprise.

"No. He did his own thing. I meant I helped clean up afterward. If anything, Grayson helped me plan it."

"Oh... that's unexpected."

Sebastian gathered what he needed, and we climbed back onto the golf cart. "Your hair looks wild right now."

"That's entirely your fault for running your fingers through it," I scolded, though I tried to smooth it down anyway.

"True, but it was worth it."

"Was it?" I asked, suddenly feeling self-conscious.

"Why are you feeling insecure about last night?"

My jaw dropped—I'd forgotten about our emotional link. A wave of amusement washed over me, and this time, I recognized it as his, not mine.

"It was my first time," I admitted, crossing my arms and looking away.

Sebastian reached over and pulled me against him in the beach seat. His hand settled on the inside of my thigh, anchoring me close. I wrapped my arm around his, resting my head on his shoulder.

"We have brunch, then Sophia has some 'girl time' planned for you all before the dance. We need to be there by 5:30," Sebastian filled me in.

Disappointed that he hadn’t acknowledged my confession, I decided to let it go. "Sounds good."

"Why are you disappointed?"

"I’m really going to hate this emotion-sharing thing," I sighed.

Sebastian smirked and pressed a kiss to my forehead.

"So?"

"You didn’t say anything about it being my first time. Clearly, you knew what you were doing."

Sebastian slammed on the brakes. If not for his grip, I would’ve been thrown forward. "Listen to me." He lifted me and repositioned me so I was straddling his lap. "I have never felt more alive. Last night was the best night of my entire life. I love you, Evelyn. I’ve never felt this way about anyone. You are my life, my world. Don’t ever doubt that."

His kiss was fierce, pouring all his love into it. When he finally pulled back, the depth of his emotion was clear in his eyes.

"I love you too," I whispered, the words both painful and exhilarating to say—and mean.

"Hmm, I heard that’s hard for you to say."

"It is."

He kissed me sweetly before letting me settle beside him again, his hand returning to my thigh as we drove back to the pack house.

To my relief, no one was around to witness my walk of shame. Sebastian took his time, but I hurried ahead—only to realize I didn’t know the door code.

"2430," Sebastian murmured in my mind. His mental voice was unfairly seductive.

"Do you want to shower first, or should I?" I asked.

"Don’t want to shower together?" he teased as we stepped inside. He shut the door and locked it.

"That’s... an idea." One that made my pulse spike. I was still sore from last night, but I refused to let awkwardness win. "Just so you know, I like my water scalding."

Thankfully, he didn’t comment on my internal struggle. "Does it have to be boiling?"

He headed straight for the bathroom, grabbing towels while I turned on the shower. Seizing the moment before he joined me, I quickly undressed and slipped under the water.

"Seriously?"

"What? It feels amazing." I stood there, eyes closed, letting the hot water cascade over me.

"I know something else that would feel even better." His hands gripped my hips, pulling me against him. The contrast of cold air and his body pressing into me sent a shiver down my spine.

###Chapter 0084

My eyes flew open just as Sebastian leaned in to kiss me. I jerked my head away instinctively. "Whoa!"

His expression darkened with hurt. "What's wrong?"

"Your mark—I mean, our mark." My fingers traced over the intricate design on his skin. It was a full black moon with an abstract pattern in the center.

Sebastian's arms tightened around my waist, pressing me flush against him as I studied it. His mark bore a stylized "S," while mine resembled an "E."

"Have you—" My words died in my throat when I looked up. His eyes had turned pitch black, his wolf surfacing. "Hey," I whispered.

He closed his eyes briefly, and when they reopened, they were normal again. Without a word, he reached for my shampoo, massaging it into my scalp. A soft moan escaped me as my head lolled back. The sensation was divine. I wrapped an arm around his waist to steady myself, feeling his desire spike through our bond.

Teasing him, I let out another deliberate moan. "Mmm, that feels amazing."

His body shuddered, but he didn't stop. Instead, he guided me under the water to rinse it out before applying conditioner. My nails lightly scraped down his back, drawing a low growl from him.

"Enjoying yourself?" he murmured.

"Always."

With a sudden movement, he pinned me against the shower wall. My breath hitched.

"Like to tease, do you?"

"No teasing," I gasped. "Just take me, Sebastian."

My hand slipped between us, stroking him firmly.

"My little temptress," he growled, his fingers finding my clit as I hooked a leg around his waist.

I was already wet, aching for him. Impatient, I pushed his hand away and guided him to me. "Please?"

That was all it took. He thrust into me with a deep, guttural groan. "Fuck, Evelyn."

My body clenched around him, the initial sting quickly giving way to pleasure. "Harder," I demanded, my nails digging into his shoulders as I matched his rhythm.

Sebastian's grip on my hips tightened, his gaze locked on my bouncing breasts. "You're going to be the death of me."

My climax hit hard, his following right after. We collapsed against each other, panting. "Thanks," I murmured, patting his shoulder weakly.

"Thanks?" He arched a brow.

When he finally pulled back, the raw love in his eyes made my chest tighten. "I love you too," I whispered, the words both terrifying and exhilarating.

"I heard that's not easy for you to say."

"It isn't."

He kissed me softly before letting me slump against him again. His hand settled on my thigh as we drove back to the pack house.

To my relief, no one was around to witness my walk of shame. Sebastian took his time, but I bolted ahead—only to realize I didn't know the door code.

"2430," his voice purred in my mind, sending a shiver down my spine.

"Shower first, or me?" I asked aloud.

His smirk was wicked. "Why not together?"

My face heated, but I forced myself to nod. "Fine. But I hope you like scalding water."

Sebastian chuckled, following me inside and locking the door behind us. "Does it have to be boiling?"

I dashed into the bathroom, stripping quickly and jumping under the spray before he could see me. Childish? Maybe. But the hot water was heavenly.

Seconds later, the shower door opened. "Seriously?"

"What? It feels good." I stood there, eyes closed, letting the water cascade over me.

His hands gripped my hips, pulling me against him. The contrast of cold air and his hard length pressing into me made me gasp.

"I know something that feels even better," he murmured.

And just like that, I was lost in him all over again.

###Chapter 0085

"I truly mean it. Thank you." Spinning around, I threw my arms around Sebastian's neck. His strong embrace enveloped me for several heartbeats before he reluctantly released me.

"We should hurry. Your birthday brunch begins in three minutes."

"Right." We moved toward the kitchen. "After this, I need to visit your office and summon Ethan. He owes me a hundred push-ups."

"You were serious about that bet?" Sebastian chuckled.

"Absolutely!" As we entered the dining room, a chorus of "Happy Birthday!" greeted us.

"Thank you!" I called out, but immediately rushed to Grayson, squeezing him tightly.

"Couldn't be happier for you, little sis," he murmured against my ear.

"Thanks. Any luck finding your mate yet?"

"Not yet, but it's definitely not Victoria. Saw her earlier - she ran off in tears." Grayson released me to shake Sebastian's hand. My father embraced me next, then greeted Sebastian warmly. Even Sebastian's parents had come.

"Welcome to our family," Alpha Benjamin said while clasping Sebastian's hand.

"Thank you! Proud to join this pack."

"Let me see it!" Sophia squealed excitedly.

Adjusting my dress, I revealed my fresh mating mark. "Impressive!" Grayson commented.

"Gorgeous!" Sophia exclaimed before dragging me toward the table. "I'm starving - can we eat now?"

"Of course!" Everyone took their seats around the lavish spread that made my stomach growl audibly. I helped myself to a grilled chicken salad and sparkling water.

"How are the party decorations coming along?" I asked my father.

"Well, we had to call Audrey since you were... occupied. She's handling everything perfectly," Grayson answered for him.

"She's amazing," I agreed.

"I'll check on the setup after brunch," Dad added.

"I noticed you had help cleaning your shop," Alpha Benjamin remarked.

"Sebastian and Grayson organized it. We finalized the new design yesterday," I explained.

"Should be ready within the week," Sebastian confirmed.

"Excellent news!" Alpha Benjamin's tone sounded suspiciously cheerful. Scanning the room, everyone wore unnaturally bright smiles.

"Dammit," Sebastian muttered under his breath.

"What aren't you telling me?" I demanded.

"What do you mean?" Grayson feigned innocence.

I fixed him with a piercing stare. "Cut the bullshit. What happened?"

Grayson exhaled heavily. "Told you she'd notice," he said to Sebastian.

"I know." Sebastian released a tense breath and met my gaze. "Dominic and the ranking wolves will attend tonight. He's requested a dance with you."

My stomach dropped. "And you all decided to keep this from me?" My accusing gaze swept across their guilty faces.

"We planned to tell you after brunch. I was going to mention it before your spa appointment," Sophia admitted sheepishly.

"Do I have to accept?" I searched Sebastian's face.

"Absolutely not," he stated firmly. His certainty helped, but unease still churned in my gut.

"We're maintaining appearances..." Dad began. The unspoken message was clear - play nice until we strike.

Accepting the situation, I stabbed my fork into the salad with more force than necessary. "Scarlett..." Sebastian reached over, his hand rubbing comforting circles on my back.

Strangely, it did calm me. "It's fine. I'll do it."

"Scar, you don't-" Grayson started.

"I said it's fine. Drop it." The words came out sharper than intended. Immediately regretting my tone, I stood abruptly. "Excuse me." I hurried to the hallway bathroom, taking deep breaths to steady myself.

"Scarlett?" Sebastian's voice came through the door.

"Come in." I braced my hands against the vanity, staring at my reflection.

He entered but kept his distance, leaning against the wall instead. "Are you okay?"

###Chapter 0086

"No, Sebastian, I'm not."

"I'm not happy about this either. I have it in me to—"

"No, Sebastian. I'm not okay because everyone thinks they need to keep secrets from me. I'm a grown woman and the Luna of this pack. Mates don't keep secrets. You had no right to hide that from me. We're supposed to be equals! I expect that from others, but not from you."

Sebastian took the scolding with grace, his expression appropriately ashamed. "You're right. I'm sorry." He stepped closer, his hands sliding up and down my arms as he stood behind me. I glared at him through the mirror. "I just wanted to protect you."

"There are some things you can't protect me from," I said, my anger cooling.

"I know. I'll try to remember that."

Turning, I let him pull me into a tight embrace. "I'm still mad at you," I mumbled, though my irritation was already fading.

"I know." He tilted my chin up and pressed a soft kiss to my lips. "Ready to go back out there?"

"Yeah."

Sebastian closed the door behind us as we stepped out, fingers intertwined. The brunch conversation had thankfully moved on, now centered around future plans.

"Have you chosen a new Beta yet?" Alpha Benjamin asked.

"Probably going to promote Nathan, but that'll require a serious conversation," Grayson sighed. "He’d need to adjust his attitude first."

"Hopefully, you find your mate tonight," Dad said. It wasn’t impossible to take the Alpha role without one, but having a mate made you stronger.

"Hope so." Grayson shot me a look—one that screamed the pressure’s on me now. I smirked back at him.

"Are you going to finish packing your room?" Grayson asked.

"Probably should. There’s not much I want to bring, but there are a few things."

"Just warning you now—Margaret is determined to turn it into a guest room ASAP. Anything left behind is getting tossed," Grayson said.

"Do I have time to grab it after we eat?" I asked Sebastian.

"Of course. We can go after. We shouldn’t stay long, but it’s your birthday. You can do whatever you want." I could tell he didn’t want to go back there, but he also didn’t want me to lose my things.

"I’ll come with you," Grayson offered. "That way, I can make sure anything you don’t bring here but don’t want Margaret to throw away gets saved."

Sebastian’s phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen before excusing himself to take the call. My eyes followed him as he stepped out.

"Is Sebastian okay with that?" Grayson asked.

"He’s fine. He just doesn’t like Margaret," I shrugged.

"No one does," Sophia muttered before clapping a hand over her mouth. "Oh my Goddess, I’m so sorry! That slipped out."

Benjamin shook his head, but the rest of us laughed. "It’s fine, sweetheart. You’ve seen how she is firsthand."

"What’s so funny?" Sebastian asked as he returned.

"Sophia," I said, taking another bite of food.

"Audrey is meeting us at the pack house. Apparently, we missed something she needs."

"On what?" I asked.

"The shop."

"Why is she working on the shop and the party?" I asked, horrified.

"Because that woman is a force of nature," Sebastian said, nodding in admiration.

"Absolutely. I better never lose her."

"Audrey has worked under you, learned from you for almost four years now," Grayson commented.

"Yep. She just needed a little guidance," I agreed.

"Doesn’t it make you jealous when Sebastian talks about Audrey like that?" Sophia asked.

The forkful of food I was about to eat froze mid-air. "N-no?" I glanced at Sebastian for backup.

"She’s really not the jealous type," Grayson answered for me.

"I guess he hasn’t given me a reason to be? I don’t know. I never really thought about it."

"Well, don’t start," Sebastian teased, making everyone laugh.

"Why?" I asked Sophia.

She opened and closed her mouth a few times, flustered. "She gets jealous over the smallest things if I’m talking to another pack member about the menu," Oliver said, rubbing her back.

###Chapter 0087

"Jealousy is natural for wolves. We're territorial creatures, and honestly, I'd be more concerned if she wasn’t jealous."

Benjamin chuckled from his seat.

"Sebastian just needs to make sure you feel included," I said, glancing at him. "Like if he's talking to someone, pull you into the conversation or ask what you think."

"You could stand to be a little jealous too," Grayson teased.

I rolled my eyes, pushing my empty plate away. "Keep dreaming."

The room erupted in laughter as we all leaned back, relaxed.

"Ready to grab your things? I’ve got stuff to do today," Grayson said, checking his watch.

"Like what? It’s your birthday too."

"But I’m the future Alpha. I don’t get a day of pampering like you do."

"Sometimes being a girl has its perks," Sophia whispered. I grinned and bumped her fist.

"Let’s go," Sebastian said, standing. We followed him outside to the cars. "Do you need a ride?"

"Nah, I don’t have that much stuff."

"Then we’re taking the convertible." Sebastian smirked, unlocking his sleek black Corvette.

"Hell yes!" I climbed in, exhilarated before we even took off. Sebastian revved the engine, and I stood up, gripping the headrest as the wind whipped through my hair. The entire drive, I stayed like that—wild, free, alive.

By the time we arrived, my hair was a tangled mess.

"Looks like a bird’s nest!" Grayson laughed.

"Totally worth it," I said, trying in vain to smooth it down.

Inside, Sebastian was tense, his arm possessive around my waist as we climbed the stairs. Only when we reached my old room did he finally relax.

"So, what do you want to take?" Grayson asked.

"My sketches, my jewelry box." I grabbed two framed photos from the wall—one of my mother holding me as a baby, the other of Dad, Grayson, and me at the park, all of us grinning as he hugged us tight.

Setting them on the table, I ducked into the bathroom to fix my hair and gather my toiletries. Thankfully, I had a large bag to stuff everything into.

A knock sounded at the door.

I stepped out just in time to see Audrey walk in, her eyes locking onto Grayson’s.

"Mate," they whispered in unison.

Audrey dropped everything and ran into his arms.

Sebastian smirked—until he saw my expression. He moved closer, his voice low in the mind link. "What’s wrong?"

"People usually mate within their rank. Or close to it."

"Yeah?"

"Audrey was an orphan when I hired her."

Understanding dawned in his eyes as we watched them kiss. His hands rubbed soothing circles on my back, but unease settled in my chest. I loved Audrey, but not knowing her origins…

Finally, they pulled apart, Audrey’s eyes shining. "Evelyn?"

I snapped out of it, forcing a smile as I hugged her. "I’m so happy for you! You’ll be an amazing Luna."

"Thank you. I never expected this," she murmured, gazing at Grayson.

"Could you show Sebastian those questions you had? I need to talk to Grayson about which photos to take."

"Of course!" Audrey beamed, leading Sebastian away while Grayson followed me into the empty closet.

"Scarlett?" he asked.

"First, I’m thrilled for you. Audrey will be incredible."

"But?"

"You need to find out where she’s from. She was an orphan when I hired her. Mates are usually within rank, Grayson. What pack abandons a ranking wolf’s daughter?"

"You think I shouldn’t mate her?"

"The opposite. Mark her. Tonight. That way, no one can take her from us. She deserves to be protected—treated like the queen she is."

Grayson exhaled, nodding. "You’re right."

"I couldn’t have picked better for you. But if you claim her before anyone finds out, they can’t challenge it. She’ll be yours."

###Chapter 0088

"Grayson?" Audrey's soft voice drifted through the closed door. Grayson quickly grabbed the photo box and stepped outside. "What's wrong? You seemed troubled."

"Just thinking about tonight's celebration," Grayson replied.

"It's going to be perfect!" Audrey beamed.

"No doubt. You always create magic." I flashed her a smile before gathering my remaining belongings. Grayson placed a box near my bookshelf. As I piled in my favorite novels, I knew Sebastian would have to carry this heavy one.

"What else?" Sebastian asked, effortlessly moving the box toward the door.

"Think that's everything." Scanning the nearly empty room, it struck me how little I'd accumulated. I'd always known this was temporary - everything I owned could fit in my arms.

Sebastian gently cupped my face. "You alright?" He sensed my emotions but respected my boundaries about him using his abilities without permission.

"Yeah. Just... realizing I never really put down roots here. Always knew this was temporary. All my worldly possessions fit in two suitcases."

"We'll build our home together," Sebastian murmured before brushing his lips against mine.

"You two are adorable," Grayson teased, his arm wrapped around Audrey as they watched us.

"Anyway," I said as Sebastian dropped his hands. "We should get going. Did you answer her question?"

"All sorted," Sebastian replied, heading toward the book box.

"See you tonight, Scarlett." Grayson pulled me into a warm hug before opening the door. Sebastian lifted the heavy box but insisted I walk ahead. Grayson held Audrey's hand as they followed behind us.

We'd just reached the foyer when a loud crash echoed through the hall. "HER? You chose HER over me?" Victoria stood there, eyes swollen from hours of crying.

"She's my mate. So yes." Grayson's voice held no room for argument. Victoria fled in tears as Audrey's expression fell. "Why are you upset?"

"Because her heart's shattered. You two were together for years. This must destroy her." Audrey gazed down the empty hallway. "Maybe I should talk to her."

"Hell no!" My response came out sharper than intended. "Maybe wait until after the mating ceremony," I added more gently.

"Okay..." Audrey still looked uncertain.

"Let's move," Sebastian mind-linked. "Don't want another run-in with that witch." Nodding, I turned toward the car. Sebastian loaded my books while I added my final boxes.

"See you tonight!" I called out as we climbed in and Sebastian hit the gas.

Sebastian rested his hand on my thigh. "How's your arm feeling?"

"Sore but healing." He kept his eyes on the road.

"You okay?" I asked, linking my arm through his.

"Yeah, just thinking about her origins."

"No clue. Never thought she was high-ranking. What kind of parent abandons their child?"

"Let's table this for tomorrow. Today's about you." Sebastian leaned over for a quick kiss.

"Still owe me that massage."

"I'll give you something better tonight," Sebastian smirked. With ten miles still to go, inspiration struck. Giving him a knowing look, I leaned over and freed him from his jeans.

"Fuck," he growled, gripping my ass. Though inexperienced, the way his body shuddered told me everything. At one point, his hand guided my head, setting the perfect rhythm until I swallowed every drop. Licking my lips, I sat back against the door as he adjusted himself. We pulled up to the pack house just in time.

"Alpha... Luna," the guard nodded, making me blush furiously.

###Chapter 0089

"You'll be the end of me," Sebastian murmured with a lazy grin.

"At least you'll die with a smile," I quipped, shrugging as the car rolled to a stop. Nathan and Benjamin were still deep in conversation outside.

"Everything go smoothly?" Nathan called over.

"Ask Grayson that," I smirked, grabbing my bags while Sebastian hefted the cardboard box.

"Is that all you brought?" Alpha Benjamin raised an eyebrow.

"Yep. Traveling light," I said as we headed upstairs. Dumping my belongings onto the coffee table, I surveyed the room.

"I need to handle some things. You good here?" Sebastian asked, lingering by the door.

"Absolutely. Sophia and I are claiming her room for the rest of the day," I said, sorting through my sketches.

"Make yourself at home. Literally. Tell me what changes you want—this is your space now." His gaze swept across the crimson-and-ebony decor.

I picked up the framed photos and my mother's jewelry box, arranging them carefully on my nightstand. "There. Unpacked." My smile wavered slightly. Sebastian was flipping through my sketchbook.

"Those are private," I warned.

"These are incredible," he breathed, pausing on a detailed portrait of Liam. "Mind if I borrow this one?"

"Why?"

"Trust me?" His tone made my stomach flip. I wanted to refuse.

"...Fine."

He pressed a kiss to my forehead. "I'll treat it like glass. Now let's find Sophia before she sends out a search party."

Sophia yanked the door open before we even knocked. "Finally!" She dragged me inside while Sebastian chuckled.

"Oliver started without you. Left a massage cart though."

"Bye!" I called as she slammed the door in Sebastian's amused face.

"Did I just piss off your mate?" Sophia asked, steering me toward the massage tables.

"Nah, he's entertained."

"Good. Strip and lie down." The therapist tactfully turned away as I undressed. The moment the warm hands hit my knotted shoulders, I melted into the table.

My mind wandered to bedroom designs. Sebastian's space was all dark luxury—blood-red accents against black leather. Maybe it didn't need changing. Maybe my soul already recognized it as home.

"Thank you!" Sophia chirped as the masseuses left. My hair resembled a bird's nest after that heavenly scalp massage.

"Should I be concerned about how good you're feeling right now?" Sebastian's voice purred through our bond.

"I'll reserve judgment until tonight's performance," I teased.

"Challenge accepted." His growl sent shivers down my spine.

"Hello? Earth to Evelyn!" Sophia snapped her fingers.

"Sorry!"

"Shower first. You reek of airport."

"Yes ma'am!" I bolted naked toward the bathroom, unable to resist leaving the mental link wide open. "Oh Sebastian..." I moaned dramatically under the spray.

"Don't you dare—stop that right now." His control was fraying.

"What? I'm just... washing. Soap's sliding everywhere—"

"Unless you want me to drag you out of that shower and take you against Sophia's door, I suggest you behave."

"Tempting offer."

"Woman..." He sounded equal parts exasperated and aroused.

"Aw, am I wearing you out already?"

"And here I thought I had the high sex drive," he muttered.

"Better keep up, Alpha." I turned off the water, grinning as I toweled dry. This game was far from over.

###Chapter 0090

"Perfect?" Sophia pulled out a stunning ivory silk blouse with matching shorts from the tissue paper. The back was embroidered with "Evelyn" in delicate script.

"I got matching ones, but mine doesn’t say Evelyn!" She held hers up triumphantly.

"I adore it!"

"Good! Now, I’m going to shower, and you have to wait for the rest until I get back!" She dashed off before I could protest.

While she was gone, I smoothed on some lotion, dressed, and started blow-drying my hair.

Just as I finished, Sophia emerged, towel-drying her curls. "Oh, good! You’ve already started."

"You wouldn’t let me open my presents yet."

"Well, you’ll have to wait until everyone’s here."

"Fine." Sophia’s love language was gift-giving, and I didn’t want to spoil her fun.

"Sit."

I obeyed, setting the dryer aside. She began twisting my hair into curlers with practiced ease.

A knock interrupted us. Sophia sprinted to the door, revealing a kitchen staff member balancing a tray of fresh fruit and vegetables.

"Alpha Sebastian thought you ladies might like some snacks."

"Thank you," I said warmly.

"You’re welcome, Luna Evelyn. Let me know if you need anything else."

"What’s your name?"

"Katie."

"Thank you, Katie." I smiled as she left.

"Sebastian for the win." Sophia popped a strawberry into her mouth.

Once my hair was set, she moved on to hers. "Sophia, are you happy here?"

"That’s a heavy question. What’s wrong?"

"Nothing’s wrong. It’s just… everything’s so sudden."

"Evelyn." She pinned a curl in place, meeting my eyes in the mirror. "I’ve known you since we were in diapers. Your commitment issues are showing. I thought you were happy with Sebastian. He treats you like royalty."

"I love Sebastian. I do. It’s just… new."

"Have you actually told him you love him?"

"Yes," I said defensively.

"Like, really told him? Not just an ‘I love you too’ in passing."

I frowned.

"Home is where Sebastian is. What do you need to make this feel like home?"

"Grayson," I sighed. My twin had always been my anchor.

"Grayson is just a phone call away. Your brother isn’t going anywhere. It’ll be different, but it’ll be good."

She finished her curlers. "Now, sit still. Makeup time."

I obeyed, staying silent as she worked her magic—smoky eyes, sharp winged liner, and deep red lips to match my dress. Black earrings tied the look together.

For my hair, she left a few strands loose, twisting the rest into an elegant low bun with intricate loops.

"Go sit over there and don’t ruin my masterpiece," she teased before starting on her own makeup.

I nibbled on carrot sticks, watching her transform. She left most of her hair down, only pinning back the front sections.

Just as she applied the final touches, the door swung open.

The guys walked in.

"You look breathtaking," Sebastian murmured, stepping toward me.

"Don’t you dare mess up her makeup!" Sophia warned as he leaned in.

"I’m her living doll," I laughed—right before he kissed me anyway.

"You two are cutting it close," Oliver remarked, checking his watch.

"Scarlett, you can open your presents now."

"Do we get to call you Scarlett too now?" Oliver joked, sinking into an armchair.

"Only if you can guess my IQ," I shot back, settling beside the gifts.

"120?"

"Nope."

The first present was from my father—a dazzling tennis bracelet. Sebastian fastened it around my wrist.

"Higher or lower?" Oliver mused.

"What a rude question!" I feigned offense.

"125?"

"You insult me," I teased, opening the next gift—a luxurious set of art supplies from Grayson.

###Chapter 0091

Sebastian shrugged casually. "I chose Italy."

"Thank you!" I exclaimed, launching myself at him.

"Don't ruin my creation!" Sophia shrieked in mock horror.

Sebastian caught me effortlessly, his lips curling into that familiar smirk as he returned my embrace. "Open ours next." Oliver remained frowning nearby. "1..." I noticed Sophia subtly flashing the number 4 with her fingers.

"Hey! That's cheating!" I protested loudly.

"1407"

"Nope." I took the envelope with a grin, discovering a gift card inside labeled 'Shopping Spree - Italy Edition.' "You guys are amazing! Though Sophia, is this really for me or just an excuse for you?" I teased.

"Both," she admitted without shame. "Your current wardrobe is a crime against Italian fashion. But don't worry, I'll enjoy fixing that. Now go get dressed."

"144?" Oliver called as I disappeared into the walk-in closet. Peeking out, I tapped my nose with a knowing finger. "Damn right."

As I slipped into my outfit, I mind-linked Sebastian. "Guess what?"

"Hmm?"

Emerging from the closet, I watched Sebastian's gaze travel over me hungrily. "No underwear," I whispered through our connection. His eyes darkened dangerously when they met mine.

Oliver had risen to embrace Sophia, but Sebastian remained frozen in place. His emotional shields were up, making him frustratingly unreadable. "Don't you like it?" I asked nervously through our bond.

Suddenly he moved, closing the distance between us in two strides. His arms wrapped around me possessively. "I'm fighting every instinct to tear this dress off you right here," he growled in my mind. "Every bastard who looks at you tonight will lose his eyes. This night better end quickly so I can fuck you until you can't walk tomorrow."

"So that's a yes?"

"It fits you like a second skin. So fucking perfect." His hands traced my curves possessively before settling on my hips.

"Thank you."

"Damn, Evelyn! Margaret's going to have a stroke when she sees you," Sophia whistled appreciatively as Oliver released her.

"That's the plan," I laughed as Sebastian finally let me go.

"We should get moving," Oliver reminded us.

"The car's waiting," Sebastian confirmed, taking my hand as we exited. His all-black tuxedo with crimson tie perfectly complemented my dress. I felt like royalty on the arm of the most dangerous man in the room.

"One more thing..." Sebastian paused in the foyer, noticing a group of younger pack members watching the dance preparations. My mating mark was clearly visible as I smiled at them.

"Hey Ethan!" I called playfully.

The group turned, and those who understood the context started laughing. "Shit," Ethan muttered, dragging his feet toward me.

"I believe I won our bet."

"Yes, Luna."

"That's one hundred push-ups," I declared.

"I'll supervise!" Theodore volunteered eagerly.

"Perfect. Tomorrow afternoon, bring all your artwork to my office. I hear you've got talent, and I want to see it."

Ethan's jaw dropped. "But why? I'm terrible."

"Because I said so. Have fun tonight!" With that, Sebastian led me away. He opened the passenger door of the sleek black car where Oliver and Sophia were already waiting in the back.

"Why the sudden interest in his art?" Oliver asked as we settled in.

"He just needs direction. I think he might have potential for the tattoo shop."

"He's a troublemaker," Oliver countered.

"Every rebel needs a cause. If I'm right, this could change everything for him."

"Oh?"

###Chapter 0092

"Clearly..." Oliver draped his arm around Sophia's shoulders. He had that classic bad-boy charm, but at least he treated Sophia right.

Sebastian turned and placed his hand possessively on my thigh. I wrapped my arm around his, leaning into his warmth. "Remember the last time we took this road?" I whispered through our mind-link. Sebastian didn't respond verbally, but his grip tightened slightly as he shifted in his seat.

Sophia and Oliver were completely absorbed in each other. Resting my head against Sebastian's shoulder, I couldn't help but smile.

"What's making you smile?" Sebastian's voice echoed in my mind.

"I'm just... happy," I replied mentally, tilting my head up to meet his gaze. He looked down and pressed a gentle kiss to my forehead.

"Good."

We arrived to find Grayson and Audrey waiting outside. "What?" Sophia exclaimed in surprise.

I practically leaped from the car, rushing toward them. "I'm so happy for you both!" I threw my arms around Grayson while Sophia embraced Audrey. Their fresh mating marks glowed proudly on their necks.

"Evelyn?" Father's booming voice called from inside. I started to dash toward the door when Grayson caught my wrist. His warning glance stopped me cold before he passed my hand to Sebastian.

"Keep her close," Grayson mouthed silently.

Sebastian's arm encircled my waist just as Father emerged. "Evelyn! You look absolutely stunning!" Father pulled me into a brief hug before shaking Sebastian's hand. Then Margaret stormed out.

"What in the goddess's name are you wearing? I gave explicit instructions!" Margaret trembled with barely contained rage. Both Grayson and Sebastian moved closer to me while Oliver quickly ushered Sophia and Audrey away.

"Margaret, enough. She looks beautiful. It's her birthday celebration," Father said firmly. Margaret ignored him, advancing toward me. I held my head high, but Sebastian stepped between us when she got too close.

"Move aside, boy!" Margaret shrieked.

"No. You've come close enough," Sebastian replied with dangerous calm.

"Let's proceed downstairs," Father interjected as Nathan appeared. After assessing the situation, Nathan positioned himself protectively behind me while Father guided Margaret away.

Grayson took Audrey's hand, falling into formation with Nathan. Sebastian and I followed, with Sophia and Oliver bringing up the rear. We boarded separate golf carts that transported us to the event center. A line of vehicles stretched as guests streamed inside. Above the entrance hung a massive banner proclaiming: "Happy Birthday Grayson and Evelyn!"

"Oh wow," I breathed as we disembarked. Sebastian kept his arm securely around me as we entered. Turning right, we waited in a small anteroom to be announced. Nathan went ahead to take his seat with Sophia and Oliver.

Now it was just Grayson, Audrey, Father, and Margaret with us in the confined space.

"Why must you always defy me? Just once, couldn't you be the daughter I deserve!" Margaret rounded on me. Sebastian's grip turned vice-like as he kept me anchored to his side.

"Margaret, not tonight! It's her birthday—either be civil or leave," Father's face flushed with anger.

"You always take her side!" Margaret's voice cracked dramatically.

"Because you're constantly being unreasonable! If I'd known you'd turn out like this, I never would have mated you. Now that Grayson has found his mate, I've had enough."

"After everything I've done to organize this event, this is my thanks?" Her sorrow instantly morphed into fury.

"Are you ready? They're about to begin," a staff member with a headset peeked in.

"Yes, we are," Father stated firmly.

"Perfect, please line up." Father positioned himself beside Margaret at the front, followed by Grayson, then me.

"Presenting Alpha Alexander and Luna Margaret!" The announcer's voice rang out. Cheers erupted as they proceeded down the aisle.

"Future Alpha Grayson and his mate Audrey!" The applause grew even louder as they made their entrance.

"I hate this part," I whispered to Sebastian. "Being the center of attention makes my skin crawl."

###Chapter 0093

Sebastian's fingers traced soothing circles on my back. "I know, sweetheart."

"How many endearments do you plan to test out?" I arched an eyebrow.

"None seem quite right yet," he murmured under his breath.

"Finally presenting - Evelyn and her mate, future Alpha Sebastian of the Crimson Fang pack!" The announcer's voice boomed as we stepped forward to thunderous applause. Blinding camera flashes nearly made me stumble as we descended the aisle. Whispers about my gown floated through the crowd like autumn leaves.

"That dress!"

"Stunning!"

"Goddess above! That silhouette!"

"Now that's a power move." That last comment made my lips twitch.

My pulse hammered against my ribs as we navigated the crimson carpet. Nathan and Margaret rose as Grayson and Audrey took their positions on the left while Sebastian and I moved right. My vision finally adjusted to reveal the packed ballroom. Our ranking pack members occupied the front rows. On the far right sat Dominic with his entourage. His gaze burned into mine like acid, sending icy tendrils down my spine.

I broke contact just as the master of ceremonies began speaking.

"Dinner service will commence shortly. Please enjoy your evening!"

As if choreographed, servers emerged with silver trays the moment everyone settled. Sebastian held my chair before taking his own. Blessedly, Nathan sat to my immediate left.

"Your drink preference, Luna Evelyn?"

I recognized Roger from my father's security detail. "Whiskey sour, please."

"And for you, Alpha Sebastian?"

"Neat bourbon."

"Thank you," I said as he moved to serve Nathan. The plate before me showcased herb-crusted lamb, truffle-infused mashed potatoes, and roasted brussels sprouts glistening with balsamic glaze. The aromas made my mouth water.

"This looks incredible," Sebastian commented under his breath.

"Divine," I agreed, savoring the first bite of tender lamb. Rich juices exploded across my tongue.

"Your little sounds should come with a warning label," Sebastian growled in my ear, his breath hot against my skin.

"Later," I promised, taking another deliberate bite.

Sebastian's retort died as our drinks arrived. The whiskey burned pleasantly down my throat.

A photographer captured several shots of us before moving on. Well-wishers kept interrupting our meal - some offering birthday wishes, others congratulating us on our mating bond.

After consuming half my meal, I began pushing food around the gilded plate. The cake ceremony loomed, followed by the obligatory first dance. All I craved was the afterparty's freedom when the DJ would unleash proper music.

Sebastian stretched his arm across the back of my chair, drawing me closer when I leaned back.

"What will it take to unwind you?" His voice echoed through our mind-link. I took another fortifying sip of whiskey.

"Not being trapped at this table."

"Posture, Evelyn! Have some decorum!" Margaret hissed across Nathan.

"Ladies and gentlemen, the cake presentation!"

I flashed Margaret a smirk that deepened her scowl. Grayson approached, offering his hand while Sebastian took my glass. We moved toward the elaborate dessert table flanking the stage.

Grayson lifted the ceremonial knife, but I shook my head. His frown deepened when he sliced into lemon cake - my least favorite flavor. My jaw clenched, but I refused to cause a scene. His accusatory glance toward Nathan revealed Margaret's smug expression.

"Almost forgot!" Nathan boomed, suddenly dashing offstage. He returned cradling a decadent chocolate cake adorned with glittering numerals. "Last chance to spoil my little girl!" The crowd erupted in laughter while Margaret's smile didn't reach her stormy eyes.

###Chapter 0094

"Enjoy, my love." Nathan pressed a tender kiss to my forehead before pulling me into a warm embrace. Grayson sliced a generous piece of cake and handed it to me with a grin. As we each took our first bites, the room erupted in applause. Conversations resumed, but just as Sebastian was leading me toward the dance floor, a familiar voice halted us.

"Happy birthday, Evelyn." Dominic's smooth tone sent an immediate chill down my spine. Sebastian's arm tightened around me, but I refused to shrink back.

"Sebastian!" I mind-linked him urgently. Though he didn't respond, the heat of his fury pulsed through our bond.

"Thank you," I said coolly. "We appreciate you joining us tonight."

Sebastian's smile was razor-thin. "Glad you could make it."

Dominic's gaze lingered on my mark before he extended a hand. "I was hoping for the honor of your first dance, Ms. Evelyn."

Sebastian's fingers twitched against my waist. Before he could react, I interlaced our hands. "That’s sweet, but my first dance belongs to my mate, Alpha Sebastian. Perhaps later."

Dominic's jaw tightened, but the music swelled, giving us the perfect excuse to slip away.

Sebastian pulled me close, his body molding against mine as I wrapped my arms around his neck.

"I’m going to rip his throat out," he muttered, scanning the room like a predator.

I tugged his face down until our foreheads touched. "Not tonight. Right now, just dance with me."

His growl softened into a purr as my thumb traced the line of his jaw. "Anything for you, love."

"You look devastating tonight," I murmured, tightening my grip on his tie.

His lips brushed my ear. "And you look good enough to eat."

"This dress needs to survive the night. I want to wear it again."

Sebastian's hand slid possessively over my hip. "No promises."

"Sebastian?" My stomach fluttered.

"Hmm?"

Holding his gaze, I whispered, "I love you."

His eyes darkened, surprise melting into something molten. "You have no idea how much I love you." His kiss was slow, deep, and utterly consuming.

A sharp tap on Sebastian’s shoulder broke us apart. Margaret stood there, Dominic at her side, her smile saccharine. "I promised Dominic the first dance with you, Evelyn."

"That wasn’t your decision to make," I said flatly. "I’ll dance with him when I choose."

Margaret’s fingers clamped around my wrist, nails biting in. "You ungrateful little—"

Sebastian wrenched me away before she could finish. "Walk away now, or you won’t like what happens next."

"Margaret, you’re causing a scene," Nathan snapped as he approached.

"I’m sick of this brat acting like she owns the world!" Margaret spat. The music cut off abruptly, every eye in the room locked on us.

Something inside me snapped.

Red tinged my vision as I stepped forward, my voice ringing clear. "I am no longer part of my father’s pack, which means you have zero authority over me. I am the Luna of Crimson Fang. You will treat me with respect, or you can get the hell out of my party. I won’t be dancing with Dominic. Any promises you made are worthless. Back. Off."

Silence.

Then—Sophia started clapping.

Sebastian’s pride burned through our bond, his claws pricking my skin as he held me close. Grayson looked like he’d just witnessed a bomb detonate.

And Margaret?

She paled.

###Chapter 0095

"That was incredible!" Sophia rushed toward me, nearly knocking me over with her enthusiasm.

"I don't know what came over me," I admitted, still a little stunned by my own actions.

"It's your inner Luna asserting herself," Oliver said approvingly, pulling Sophia close. "Your authority was challenged, and your wolf refused to stand for it."

Sebastian immediately wrapped an arm around my waist as we followed Oliver to his table. Nathan had his arm draped around some girl, Zachary was doing the same, and Grayson had just arrived.

"Audrey! Congratulations!" Sophia embraced her warmly.

"I'm still in shock!" Audrey beamed, her smile stretching from ear to ear.

Sebastian handed me my drink just as the music shifted. The younger crowd surged onto the dance floor, moving like they were in a nightclub.

"Now this is a party!" Nathan raised his glass, his haunted eyes locking onto mine.

"I have a surprise for you," Sebastian murmured in my ear. He led me to the front of the tent, where a grand display stood—a massive portrait of Liam surrounded by an exquisite floral arrangement.

"Thank you," I whispered, slipping my arm around Sebastian’s waist as I took it in.

"I still can't believe he's gone," Nathan said quietly, stepping up behind us.

"Me neither. I keep expecting him to walk through the door any second," I replied.

"This was a thoughtful gesture, man." Nathan extended his hand to Sebastian.

"I can’t imagine what you're going through. If there’s anything I can do—"

"Appreciate it. Just take care of our girl. She’s like a sister to me."

"She is something special," Sebastian agreed.

We returned to the group, where Sebastian settled into a chair and I perched on his lap.

"That dress is everything," Audrey gushed.

"Thanks! I thought it was fitting for tonight." I took a sip of my drink and gave a playful shimmy.

"Let’s dance!" Sophia grabbed my hand as Low by Flo Rida blasted through the speakers.

Laughing, I jumped up and followed her onto the dance floor.

Sebastian’s POV

"I want Dominic removed from this event," I told the table. Grayson, Oliver, Nathan, and Zachary all leaned in.

Nathan sent his date off to dance so we could talk freely.

"What’s the plan?" Oliver asked.

"I don’t give a damn how it’s done. Evelyn does not lay eyes on him again."

"I’ll handle it." Nathan stood and disappeared into the crowd. Grayson watched him go but made no move to interfere.

"Your guy good?" I was struggling to keep my fury in check.

"He’s got this," Grayson assured me.

"There’s been enough drama already." I downed the rest of my drink. "Grayson, you got her?"

"Yeah. Grab me another one." He finished his as well.

I didn’t realize how terrifying my expression was until people instinctively cleared a path for me.

"A-Alpha Sebastian? What c-can I get you, sir?" the bartender stammered.

"Two whiskeys on the rocks and a whiskey with Dr. Pepper."

He nodded and got to work. "Lovely evening, isn’t it?"

My fist clenched.

"What the hell do you want, Dominic?"

"Just one dance." He slid his glass to another bartender.

"Over my dead body."

"I’m sorry, Alpha Dominic, we’re out of Jameson. Would you accept Jim Beam instead?"

"Pathetic bar. Fine." The bottle was already open, but I spotted a fresh, unopened Jameson behind the counter. The bartender poured his drink and handed it over.

"Good evening, sir." He slid my glasses toward me before retreating.

"Careful, people might think we’re enemies," Dominic said, taking a large sip.

"We sure as hell aren’t friends." I bit back the rest of my words.

"I have a feeling we’ll be seeing more of each other," Dominic muttered—just before his stomach twisted violently.

"Sounds like you need a bathroom." I smirked. Jumping him would be too obvious. Poisoning him would start a war. But giving him an unpleasant evening? That was just poetic.

"What the hell did you do to me?" His glare turned murderous as sweat beaded on his forehead.

###Chapter 0096

"Me? What did I do?" I chuckled. Seizing the moment, my fist collided with his abdomen. Simultaneously, his control shattered as liquid shame trickled down his leg. Watching him stumble out of the room in a pathetic half-run was downright comical.

I pulled out my wallet and slid a crisp $50 bill toward the bartender. "Thanks," I murmured before rejoining our table just as the girls arrived. I pushed Grayson's drink toward him as Nathan returned.

"Get the drinks alright?" Grayson asked, raising an eyebrow.

"Yep. Mission accomplished," Nathan smirked, earning an eye roll from Grayson.

"What were you two up to?" Evelyn demanded, taking a sip of her cocktail with narrowed eyes.

"Absolutely nothing. Just securing our next round," I defended, raising my hands innocently.

"Relax and enjoy your night," Grayson interjected, taking a slow sip.

"It's your birthday too," Evelyn reminded him, glancing around before whispering something in his ear. His body tensed almost imperceptibly, his expression remaining carefully neutral. I doubted anyone else noticed the subtle shift.

"Hey Scarlett, you ready for tomorrow?" Sophia peered at Evelyn over her glass.

Excitement lit up Evelyn's face. "Hell yes! This is going to be epic."

I took a sip of my drink, having momentarily forgotten about her ridiculous challenge. The idea still pissed me off—not because I doubted her skills, but because she had nothing left to prove as Luna. Why risk herself in some pointless fight?

"We should barbecue afterward!" Sophia was already planning the entire celebration.

"Alpha, we've got a situation out back," a warrior's voice echoed through my mind-link.

"Ladies, excuse us," I said, nodding for Grayson to follow. Oliver and Nathan subtly repositioned themselves to keep watch over the girls, though they were too engrossed in their scheming to notice our departure.

Grayson didn't ask questions, falling into step beside me as we exited through the front and rounded the building. Four of my warriors stood over three men sprawled on the ground.

"What's going on?" I demanded, then heard the whimper. A young woman was huddled against the wall, her dress torn, blood trickling from her nose.

"Exactly what it looks like, Alpha. We heard her scream and intervened," my warrior reported, his knuckles bruised and bloody.

"Get them up," I ordered, shrugging off my jacket and rolling up my sleeves. Grayson mirrored my movements.

"Move them into the trees," I commanded. Two warriors hauled each offender to their feet.

"She was asking for it!" one spat. My fist connected with his jaw before he could finish—the satisfying crack confirmed it was broken.

Deep in the woods, my warriors pinned them down.

"Mom, there's a girl outside who needs help," I mind-linked her, then severed the connection before she could respond. She didn't need to hear the details.

"What pack are you from?" I already knew the answer.

"Screw you—" Grayson's punch to the gut cut him off.

"You think you can take what isn't yours?" I didn't wait for an answer, driving my fist into another's stomach. My knee snapped his nose, and when he crumpled, I stomped on his groin. Hauling him up by his collar, I growled, "Touch another woman like that again, and I'll end you." The final punch knocked him unconscious. Thank the moon I was wearing black.

"Handle them," I told my warriors.

Grayson and I emerged to find Mom kneeling beside the trembling girl. Both looked up as we approached.

"How is she?" Grayson asked softly.

"Could've been worse," Mom said grimly.

"What pack are you from?"

"Nightshade," she whispered.

"Is this common there?"

"Y-yes," she admitted reluctantly. "Please, just let me go. If word gets back, they'll make it worse for me."

"How old are you?"

"Nineteen."

"Got a mate?" Grayson asked.

"N-no." She shook her head. I offered my hand, helping her up. Her blood smeared onto my sleeve.

###Chapter 0097

"Let my mother take you to the restroom and help you freshen up before rejoining the celebration," I ordered.

There was hesitation in her eyes, but she had little choice.

"Come with me, sweetheart," Mother said gently, wrapping an arm around her shoulders. We trailed behind them as they disappeared into the women's restroom, while we entered the men's.

Nathan was at the sink, washing his hands. The moment we stepped in, his posture stiffened.

"What is that scent?" Grayson and I exchanged confused glances.

"Blood," I answered casually, turning on the faucet. Before I could even dip my hands under the water, I was suddenly slammed against the wall. My claws and fangs instinctively emerged as my fingers curled around his throat.

"What the hell, Nathan?" Grayson demanded.

Nathan ignored my grip, inhaling deeply near my hand. Then it clicked.

"Damn it," I muttered, retracting my claws. I dragged him out of the restroom without another word. Not bothering to knock, I pushed open the women's restroom door.

Mother gasped in shock.

"Sebastian! What in the world—?"

"Bring the girl out here," I commanded, my tone leaving no room for argument. They exchanged uneasy glances before reluctantly stepping out. Grayson stood nearby, arms crossed. Our commotion had drawn attention—the music had stopped, and a crowd had gathered.

Evelyn approached, her eyes widening at the sight of my hand still gripping Nathan's throat. "Sebastian?"

I raised a finger, signaling her to wait. Mother and the girl emerged, and the moment their eyes met, they both gasped.

"Mate!"

Nathan lunged forward, but the girl froze in place. I grabbed her arm, hauling both of them outside.

"Sebastian! Stop!" Mother shouted, clearly fearing what I might do. Unfortunately, the crowd followed us.

"Everyone—back inside!" I snarled, my Alpha authority lacing the words. The crowd dispersed immediately, leaving only Mother, Evelyn, Sophia, Oliver, Grayson, Audrey, and our parents.

"Let me go!" Nathan demanded.

"Shut your mouth," I growled, tightening my grip just enough to silence him. The girl stood frozen, trembling. I released her, and she instinctively put distance between herself and Nathan.

"Nathan, listen. She was just attacked. She’s terrified and needs space," I said, trying to reason with him.

"We already handled the ones responsible," Grayson added, stepping forward. Nathan stopped struggling. Grayson gave me a nod, and I released him.

"Nathan is the Gamma of the Crimson Fang Pack—Grayson’s pack. You’ll be safe there. He’ll treat you right," I assured the girl, softening my tone.

She hesitated before taking a few tentative steps toward Nathan. He held out his hands, waiting for her to make the first move. Her fingers trembled as she reached out, barely brushing his before jerking back.

"What was that?" she whispered, looking around in confusion.

"The mate bond," Evelyn explained, stepping forward. She wrapped her arms around my waist.

The girl tried again, this time placing her entire hand in Nathan’s. Slowly, she inched closer until she was wrapped in his embrace. Nathan held her tightly, his expression softening.

"Well, well. What do we have here?" Dominic’s voice cut through the moment as he stepped out from the doorway. "Cassandra?"

"Y-yes, Alpha?" She immediately dropped to her knees before him. I clenched my fists, fighting the urge to shift.

"It seems she’s mated to my Gamma, Nathan," Grayson said through gritted teeth. Evelyn released me, ushering the other women back.

"Is this true?" Dominic asked Cassandra.

"Yes, Alpha," she murmured, keeping her head bowed.

"Hmm. Interesting," Dominic mused.

"Then it’s settled. She’ll be returning with us," Grayson declared.

"What about her belongings?"

"We have a tradition—newly mated members receive an entirely new wardrobe," Evelyn interjected. I glanced back to find her standing protectively in front of all the women, even my mother.

Dominic smirked. "I’ll tell you what. I’ll allow her to leave with Nathan… if you dance with me to the song of my choice." His gaze locked onto Evelyn.

Her spine straightened, but her eyes flicked to Cassandra, who was trembling in fear.

###Chapter 0098

"One dance. That's all you get if you behave." My gaze sharpened as I stared her down.

"Perfect. Shall we?" Dominic extended his arm with practiced elegance. Evelyn deliberately avoided my eyes as she took it. The moment her fingers touched his sleeve, I felt another hand clamp around my bicep.

"Release me. Now." My voice carried the weight of an alpha's command.

"Stay back. I've got this." Grayson's grip tightened. The only man in this pack bold enough to lay hands on me without consequences.

"I said I'm fine." Wrenching free, I stormed into the ballroom just as the music shifted to a sensual tango. Of all the damn dances. My vision tinted red when Dominic's palm hovered dangerously close to the curve of Evelyn's backside.

"Sebastian..." Oliver and Sophia approached cautiously.

"Back. Off." I snatched the whiskey from Oliver's hand and downed it in one burning gulp. He guided Sophia away, but Grayson remained rooted beside me. "I don't need a damn minder."

"Where you go, I go." His jaw clenched with the same restraint I fought to maintain. But he couldn't feel what I did - Evelyn's revulsion radiating through our bond like acid.

"We're leaving after this song."

"Same."

As the final notes played, Dominic dipped Evelyn low, pressing his lips to her knuckles. My glass shattered against the marble floor. "Just thanking her for the dance," he purred. I yanked Evelyn against my chest, fingers digging into her waist.

"Cassandra's returning with Nathan tonight." My declaration left no room for argument.

"A deal's a deal," Dominic smirked at Evelyn.

Spinning on my heel, I dragged Evelyn toward the exit. Passing our table, I barked, "We're leaving. Now!" To her credit, she matched my furious pace without protest. The fleet of black SUVs materialized at the entrance - Oliver must've alerted the drivers, not that I gave a damn.

I tore open the driver's door. "Out." The command sent the pack member scrambling. Around us, others piled into vehicles. Oliver and Sophia sat deathly quiet in the backseat.

The engine roared to life as my foot smashed the accelerator.

"GODDAMMIT!" My fist pounded the steering wheel. Evelyn's delicate hand settled on my thigh, but I white-knuckled the wheel as we tore down the highway. Distance dulled the edge of my rage, but the embers still burned hot.

"Open the fucking gates!" The mind-link command had the wrought iron screeching open just enough for me to sideswipe through. Gravel sprayed as we skidded to a stop. Only one thought consumed me.

Evelyn sprinted ahead, beating me to the bedroom door. My code disengaged the lock, and I barely let it click shut before pinning her against the wall. Our mouths crashed together as her fingers worked frantically at my buttons. I hiked up her dress while she shoved my pants down.

One probing finger had her arching off the wall. "Sebastian!" Her nails scored my shoulders as her head fell back.

No more waiting. She was ready. I was desperate. Driving into her, she locked her legs around my hips, meeting every thrust with equal ferocity.

"I'll make this up to you," I growled against her throat.

"Harder, Sebastian!"

"Say my name!"

"Sebastian!" Her moan sent fire through my veins.

"Again!"

"SEBASTIAN!" The scream tore from her throat as I buried my teeth in her claiming mark, spilling into her with a roar.

My own shoulder burned where her teeth broke skin. The compulsion eased, but I wasn't finished with her yet.

Evelyn's POV

Every muscle ached this morning - a delicious reminder of last night's passion. Wrapped in Sebastian's arms, I'd never felt more protected. After yesterday's ordeal, I never wanted to leave this bed.

"You're awake." His sleep-rough voice wasn't a question, but a statement of fact.

###Chapter 0099

"Not happening." I pressed my backside deeper against Sebastian's warmth, feeling his chest vibrate with quiet laughter.

"You need proper fuel before your fight today." His fingers traced idle patterns on my bare shoulder. "This victory will establish your dominance."

"Can't wait!"

The mattress dipped as he sat up. "This isn't a game, Evelyn. Winning deters future challengers." His tone carried more weight than I felt about the situation.

"Who else would dare? Besides, I'm the one who initiated this challenge." Rolling out of bed, I stretched lazily. Being naked around Sebastian had become second nature now. I caught his heated gaze following my movements as I sauntered to the bathroom, deliberately swaying my hips before shutting the door.

Though I didn't need cleansing, last night's activities lingered on my skin. The shower handle squeaked as I turned it, steam quickly fogging the glass. The door creaked open just as hot water cascaded over my shoulders.

"Others might be waiting for the right moment to challenge you." Sebastian's voice cut through the spray as he joined me beneath the water. I resisted the urge to scoff at his paranoia.

"Worried I'll lose?" I worked shampoo through my strands while Sebastian scrubbed his torso. The domesticity struck me - no frantic groping, just two bodies sharing space comfortably. It defied all my previous assumptions about shared showers.

His hands stilled. "I've never seen you fight properly. The thought of watching..." His jaw tightened. "Let's just say I'm not looking forward to it."

"Is Grayson coming?"

"Supposedly." We switched positions under the spray, his fingers massaging my scalp as he rinsed the suds away.

"Still can't process him and Audrey being mates." The water turned cooler as I contemplated my brilliant but physically unimposing friend. "Wonder how Victoria's handling it."

Sebastian's hands froze on my shoulders. "Victoria fights?"

The implication hung between us like the steam. "Yes. Unlike Audrey - she's strictly academia like me."

"Yet here you are." He turned off the water with more force than necessary, thrusting a towel at me.

Drying off in the walk-in closet, Sebastian kept his back turned while dressing. "I've got pack business this morning."

"I know my way to the arena." My fingers tightened around the towel. His mood had been souring all week, ever since the challenge became official. We weren't even properly mated when I'd issued it.

"Fine." The bedroom door slammed behind him hard enough to rattle the framed photos.

"Someone woke up on the wrong side of the moon," I muttered, grabbing my phone. Audrey answered on the second ring, breathless.

"Evelyn! We're just leaving - Grayson has Alpha business with Sebastian." Background noise suggested frantic movement.

"I wanted updates on the shop designs." My fingers traced the duvet's embroidery. "Feels strange not working."

"Right, right." Her distracted tone indicated she wasn't really listening. "Bring everything later then?"

"Sure. See you soon." The call ended abruptly.

The sports bra clung to my torso as I assessed my reflection. White performance fabric contrasted sharply with the black piping of my compression shorts, showcasing every curve and muscle. My wolf preened at our lethal silhouette. Tennis shoes squeaked on hardwood as I headed downstairs.

The packhouse hummed with Saturday morning energy. Laughter ricocheted off marble floors as pups darted between adults' legs. 7:30am meant training had concluded, yet the air crackled with residual adrenaline. My wolf basked in this vibrant pack energy - not officially members yet, but Sebastian's mark on my neck declared our place here.

###Chapter 0100

The kitchen doors were wide open, likely blown ajar by the lively chatter inside. Rows of tables were filled with pack members sharing stories from their day. My gaze immediately landed on Sophia sitting at the front table with Oliver. Grinning, I made my way over to them.

"Hey, you two!" I greeted cheerfully, pulling out a chair across from them.

"Evelyn! Didn't expect to see you here!" Sophia turned away from Nathan to face me. He leaned back, raising an eyebrow.

"Why not?"

"After last night, I figured Sebastian would’ve locked you in your room by now." Her eyes sparkled with mischief.

"Ugh. He’s in a mood this morning. No idea where he even is." I rolled my eyes and mirrored Nathan’s relaxed posture.

"What did you do?" Sophia laughed.

"I didn’t do anything! He’s pissed about the challenge today." I lowered my voice so others wouldn’t overhear. "Honestly, I think he’s the one PMSing."

Sophia burst into laughter while Oliver barely suppressed a smirk. "Grayson should be here soon with Audrey. Pretty sure Nathan’s bringing Cassandra too."

That caught my attention. "Seriously?" I leaned forward, hands flat on the table.

"Yeah. There’s a big meeting after your challenge. Wait—Sebastian didn’t tell you?"

My eyes narrowed. That bastard. "Nope. He conveniently left that out." I stood abruptly. "Excuse me. I need to have a chat with my mate." My voice dripped with venom.

"This is gonna be good," Oliver muttered as I spun on my heel. My good mood evaporated with every angry step echoing up the stairs to Sebastian’s office. I didn’t bother knocking—just threw the door open.

Sebastian sat behind his desk, and Isabella stood before him, freshly showered and dressed to impress.

My wolf snarled. My eyes flashed gold as Sebastian pinched the bridge of his nose and exhaled deeply.

"Cozy," I drawled, striding inside. Sophia and Oliver slipped in behind me, shutting the door before claiming the couch like front-row seats to a show.

"This doesn’t involve you," Isabella snapped.

"Oh?" I deliberately bumped her shoulder as I passed, then planted myself on Sebastian’s lap. His chair screeched backward from the force, and he grunted—but didn’t push me away. Crossing my arms, I glared at her. "Last I checked, this is my office too, since I’m the future Luna. Whatever you need to say to my mate, you can say in front of me."

Sebastian’s amusement radiated through our bond.

"Isabella requested a meeting before the challenge," he explained.

"Great. What’s so urgent? You can’t cancel it—only I can do that. So, enlighten me."

"The challenge was issued before you two mated, making this Sebastian’s decision, not yours." She jutted out a hip, her top straining over her chest.

"Wrong. By that logic, I was still under my father’s pack. That means he could’ve stopped it—or Alpha Benjamin. But guess what? It’s happening."

"I was trying to spare you the humiliation of losing." She smirked. "Besides, I know what Sebastian likes in bed. I’d be a better mate."

My claws unsheathed.

Sophia whistled. "Oh, she asked for it."

Sebastian’s grip tightened on my waist—not to restrain me, but in warning.

Isabella didn’t notice. "Face it, Evelyn. You’re just a placeholder."

I lunged.

###Chapter 0101

The world around me blurred as fury ignited in my veins. My wolf surged forward, her dominance radiating as I stood abruptly. Without hesitation, I stalked toward Isabella, seizing her by the nape of her neck and forcing her face down. My wolf’s gaze locked onto Sebastian’s.

"Start the damn challenge. Now."

I didn’t wait for a response. Dragging Isabella out of the office, I marched straight through the packhouse. Whispers erupted behind us—gasps, curses, and murmurs of excitement. My wolf ignored them all, her focus razor-sharp as we reached the freshly prepared fighting ring.

I shoved Isabella inside, sending her sprawling onto her hands and knees. Stepping back, I kept my eyes trained on her, my chest heaving with barely contained rage.

"Evelyn—" Sebastian’s voice cut through the tension behind me.

"Back off, Sebastian." I snapped through the mind-link. As furious as I was, I refused to air our grievances in front of an audience. "How dare you hide a meeting with Cassandra from me? And then I walk in to find you alone with her? She had the audacity to imply she knows what you like in bed!" My voice cracked with hurt. "I’m supposed to be your equal. Is this how it’s going to be? Secrets and lies? I won’t live like that."

I turned just enough to let him see the betrayal in my eyes. He took a step toward me, but I matched it with a retreat. His expression darkened.

"Grayson and your family just arrived," he said tersely before turning away, striding toward Alpha Benjamin, who stood with his arms crossed, glaring at his son.

Grayson approached me cautiously, hands raised. "Scarlett?"

"I’m going to kill her," I growled through clenched teeth.

He exhaled sharply and placed his hands on my shoulders. "Breathe." When I stubbornly refused, he squeezed gently. "Scarlett. Come on."

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Oliver restraining Sebastian, keeping him at bay. Reluctantly, I focused back on Grayson and forced myself to inhale deeply. My wolf reluctantly receded, allowing me to regain control.

"I’m fine," I muttered after a moment.

"What happened?"

"Sebastian didn’t tell me about the meeting with Cassandra. Like I’m some afterthought." My voice trembled. "And then I find him with her, and she—" I cut myself off, the humiliation burning in my chest.

Grayson sighed, nodding as he pieced together my fragmented explanation. "You know he has to meet with people—"

"Not her!" I snapped.

"Then tell him that. Set boundaries. Evelyn, I don’t know Sebastian well, but I do know he loves you. He wouldn’t hurt you intentionally."

"Whose side are you on?" I huffed, crossing my arms. "You’re supposed to punch him for me."

He smirked before turning serious again. "Listen. Every new couple—especially those in power—goes through this. Did you really think everything would be perfect?"

I glanced at Sebastian. His arms were folded, his gaze locked onto me like a predator’s. Oliver and Alpha Benjamin stood slightly in front of him, a silent barrier.

"I don’t know," I admitted quietly. "I was so focused on escaping Margaret that I didn’t think beyond that."

Grayson squeezed my shoulder. "You’re the smartest person I know. But when it comes to emotions? You’re just as messy as the rest of us."

The first rumble of thunder rolled in the distance, dark clouds gathering on the horizon.

The storm wasn’t just coming.

It was already here.

###Chapter 0102

"How dare you!" I swatted at Grayson's arm with playful irritation.

My twin brother chuckled deeply before pulling me into a bear hug. "Focus, Evelyn. Isabella's been training for this fight since puberty. Stop acting like some lovesick pup and get your head in the game. You could wipe the floor with her if you'd just concentrate."

"I know, I know," I grumbled, rolling my eyes. "How are you so calm about all this? You only found your mate yesterday too."

"Dad had 'the talk' with me at least a dozen times. You were always too busy with your tattoo parlor to discuss mating bonds." Grayson hesitated before adding, "Besides... we never knew for certain who your mate would be."

"FIGHTERS READY?" Alpha Benjamin's voice thundered across the arena. My gaze snapped back to the present. The bleachers were packed, someone was demonstrating a chokehold to Isabella, and then I spotted my father standing proudly beside Audrey.

"You've got this, Scarlett." Grayson gave me one final squeeze before retreating to the sidelines.

Turning toward my opponent, I began stretching my limbs methodically. Adrenaline coursed through my veins like liquid fire. My wolf Sierra paced hungrily in my mind's eye, fangs bared - she wanted vengeance. Isabella shot me a smug look before deliberately turning to flash Sebastian a sickeningly sweet smile. But my mate's eyes never left mine.

I felt several attempts from Sebastian to mind-link, but I kept that connection firmly closed. Nothing he could say would help now. This fight was for me. Nobody assaults the future Luna in her own club's restroom and walks away unscathed.

"BEGIN!" My father's command rang out, and Isabella charged like a rabid animal.

Dropping into a defensive stance, I analyzed her approach. If memory served, she favored her right side. Just as predicted, she feinted left before swinging hard with her right fist. I raised my forearm to block, simultaneously driving my left elbow toward her ribs. She blocked that too - but never saw my knee coming. It connected solidly with her diaphragm.

"Ugh!" She wheezed but recovered alarmingly fast. Using her momentum, she swept my legs out from under me.

"Damn it," I hissed as I fell backward, twisting midair to land in a crouch. Isabella was already on me, delivering a sharp kidney punch - a move we'd practiced endlessly during training. Muscle memory took over.

In one fluid motion, I wrapped an arm around her throat and flipped us over. Though she managed to land a glancing blow to my temple, I quickly gained the dominant position. Drawing back my fist, I drove it straight into her nose with a sickening crunch. Blood sprayed across the mat in crimson arcs.

Not ready to end this yet, I stood and stepped back, wiping my knuckles on my shorts. "Get up, you pathetic excuse for a she-wolf," I taunted loudly, wanting every pack member to witness her humiliation.

Isabella groaned, resetting her broken nose with a nauseating pop before staggering upright. "That all you got?" Her voice came out nasally from the swelling.

She lunged again, but her movements were sluggish now. Child's play to block her telegraphed right hook and deliver an uppercut that sent her flying backward. Sierra was still howling for blood inside me. Stalking forward, I grabbed Isabella's collar and yanked her up only to deliver a devastating roundhouse kick to her sternum.

The impact sent her careening into the boundary ropes before collapsing to her knees. When she tried rising, her arms buckled beneath her. I flipped her onto her back with my boot. Her face had swollen grotesquely, one eye completely shut. The other glared up at me with fading defiance.

"Stay the hell away from my mate." My final punch landed with satisfying finality, knocking her unconscious instantly. The crowd erupted as I calmly wiped Isabella's blood from my hands. My breathing remained steady - this had barely been a workout.

###Chapter 0103

"WINNER, EVELYN ANDREWS."

My breath caught as Grayson strode toward me, lifting my hand in victory. My gaze darted across the gathered pack members until it locked onto Sebastian.

His eyes burned with a mix of fury and pride—I could feel it through the bond. Yet he didn’t move. He just stood there, watching.

Confusion twisted inside me. Why wasn’t he coming to me?

"Why isn’t Sebastian here?" I whispered to Grayson.

His frown deepened as he met my eyes. "I’m sorry, Scarlett. I didn’t know this would happen."

His words only confused me more.

"EVELYN IS NOW THE MATE OF MY SON! MARKED AND BOUND, SHE STANDS AS YOUR FUTURE LUNA! IF ANYONE WISHES TO CHALLENGE HER, SPEAK NOW OR FOREVER HOLD YOUR PEACE!" Alpha Benjamin’s voice boomed across the field.

Betrayal sliced through me as I stared at Sebastian. He hadn’t warned me.

My jaw clenched. I scanned the crowd, searching for challengers. I’d put on a show, but that didn’t mean someone wouldn’t step forward. I hadn’t even known this was tradition here.

Silence stretched.

Then Alpha Benjamin spoke again. "NO CHALLENGERS! THEN LET ME PRESENT YOUR FUTURE LUNA—EVELYN ANDREWS!"

Deafening cheers erupted.

Sebastian finally approached as Grayson released my hand and stepped back. I refused to look at him, but I let him take my wrist and raise it high. The pack roared, celebrating their future Alpha and Luna.

When Sophia rushed toward me, I yanked my arm free and went to her. She threw her arms open. "That’s how you make an entrance!"

"Thanks," I laughed as we broke apart.

"Impressive," Oliver grinned, pulling Sophia back to his side.

"Eve!" Audrey hurried over with Grayson and my father.

"Hey!" I waved as they neared. Audrey hugged me first, then Grayson, and finally Dad.

"Proud of you," Dad said, holding my gaze. Something in his eyes made my chest swell.

"Thanks, Dad."

"Excellent work, Evelyn." Alpha Benjamin approached, smiling.

Anger flared hot in my veins. "I wasn’t aware you’d be opening the floor to challengers," I said bluntly.

A few pack members looked away. Dad stiffened.

"You didn’t know?"

"No. No one mentioned I might have to fight half the pack today."

Alpha Benjamin barely blinked. "It’s tradition. Best to handle it now rather than face surprise challenges later."

"That’s bullshit," I snapped. "If you’ll excuse me, I need to change for this meeting about Cassandra."

I turned on my heel and walked off before he could respond. I might have overstepped, but I doubted Sebastian or Dad would let Benjamin retaliate when he was clearly in the wrong.

"Evelyn!" Sebastian barked.

I ignored him. If I turned around now, I’d punch him. Instead, I quickened my pace, shoving all my rage through the bond. Let him feel how furious I was.

The front door slammed behind me as I stormed inside, my boots echoing on marble until I hit the stairs. He was right behind me, but I didn’t stop until I reached our room.

The worst part? I had to unlock the damn door, giving him time to catch up.

The second I stepped inside, his hand closed around my arm.

I spun—and my fist flew.

###Chapter 0104

"Whoa!" Sebastian dodged my punch. His fingers wrapped around my wrist like steel bands as he kicked the door shut, slamming me against it. His body pressed flush against mine, and despite my anger, my traitorous body reacted instantly, heat pooling low in my stomach. "That wasn't very nice," he murmured, his lips brushing mine.

"Go to hell," I hissed.

"Mmm, gladly." I could feel the hard length of him against my thigh.

With every ounce of strength I had, I shoved him back. "I can't believe you! First, I find out there's some secret meeting about Cassandra that you never even mentioned to me. Then I walk in on you and Isabella—alone! And don't even get me started on how you stormed out this morning after your father opened the challenge to everyone! What else are you hiding from me?" My voice rose with every accusation.

Sebastian stood there, infuriatingly calm, arms crossed over his broad chest. His eyes darkened as I ranted, but he said nothing. Just that damn "Hmm."

"What gives you the right to keep secrets from me? I thought we were equals! We've been mated for one damn day, and you're already treating me like I'm beneath you!" I turned away, pacing furiously. "I told you from the start—I'd rather be alone than be treated like some subordinate. Just because I wasn't sorry about issuing the challenge doesn't mean you get to sulk and walk away! You're supposed to have my back, Sebastian! You—"

He moved faster than I could react, grabbing my arm and yanking me against him. His mouth crashed down on mine, silencing me. I struggled, but it was useless. One hand cradled the back of my head, the other pressed into the small of my back, holding me in place. His thumb brushed my jaw, then slid down to my throat, applying just enough pressure to send a shiver of desire through me. The fight drained out of me in seconds.

"You..." His lips trailed down my neck. "Done... yelling?" His grip tightened on my ass, lifting one of my legs to wrap around his waist. My body melted against his.

"N-no," I gasped as his tongue traced my mating mark.

He lifted me effortlessly, carrying me to the couch and pinning me beneath him. Even if I wanted to escape, I couldn't. "Too bad." He captured both my wrists, holding them above my head. "For my safety."

"Get. Off." I exhaled sharply.

"Not until you listen." His gaze locked onto mine, unyielding.



"Fine. Try explaining why I've spent the whole day feeling betrayed." My voice dripped with sarcasm.

"First," he said, voice low, "you knew from the beginning how much I hated this challenge."

"Yeah, because Isabella was your girlfriend, and you’d do anything to protect her." My wolf snarled inside me.

"Wrong." His grip on my wrists didn’t loosen, but his other hand cupped my cheek, thumb stroking gently. "I ended things with her the day she disrespected you at the pizza place. I never had strong feelings for her. The moment I kissed you in that club, I knew you were mine. I love you, Evelyn. I was worried about your safety—I’ve never seen you fight. All I’ve seen is you getting hurt. Over and over. For once, I just wanted you to be safe."

He wasn’t wrong. Pain—physical or emotional—had been my constant companion. "And the secret meeting?"

Sebastian rolled his eyes. "I was going to tell you after the challenge. I wanted you focused, not distracted. Oliver will hear about this."

"And Isabella?" I ground out.

"That wasn’t planned. She was released from the cells this morning. I went to my office to cool off before the challenge so I could support you. She walked in a minute before you did. I didn’t even get a chance to speak before she demanded I cancel the challenge."

###Chapter 0105

He wasn’t lying. That much was clear. Every word he spoke was punctuated by his piercing gaze, locking onto mine as he swore his innocence. "Opening the challenge?"

Fury flickered in his own eyes. "I had no idea he would pull that stunt. Believe me, I’ll be having a very long conversation with him."

"That was absolute bullshit," I spat, my voice laced with raw frustration.

"I know." Sebastian leaned in, pressing a firm kiss to my lips. "I’m truly sorry."

My anger ebbed slightly, but not entirely. "What’s the meeting with Cassandra about?"

"Figuring out how this all works. She was part of the Nightshade Pack. She might have intel on why they targeted your shop. You saw what happened to her last night. That’s standard over there."

The rage flared back to life. "I still can’t believe that actually happened." My body relaxed under Sebastian’s touch, my head tilting into his palm as his fingers traced my jawline.

"I’d never let anything like that happen to you," he vowed, his voice low and dangerous.

"What did you do to those guys?"

"Grayson and I handled it." The finality in his tone told me that was all I’d get.

"I don’t regret dancing with Dominic," I said, meeting his gaze head-on. "I hated every second of it, but I saved Cassandra... sort of."

Sebastian’s expression darkened. "You have no idea how hard it was to watch that. I was this close to snapping his neck."

"I wouldn’t have minded that." I tilted my head up, my tongue flicking against his lips teasingly before pulling back.

"I did enjoy you storming into my office and planting yourself on my lap," Sebastian murmured, his breath hot against my ear as his tongue traced the shell of it.

"Next time, I won’t be so gentle," I promised, lifting my knee to press firmly against him.

"Next time, I won’t hesitate to take you right there in front of whoever’s watching," he growled.

That—that was a promise.

"Hmm, sounds like a challenge. And you know how I handle challenges."

"Is that what you want? Someone watching me bury myself inside you?" Sebastian’s voice was rough, his claws lightly scraping up my sides, catching the hem of my shirt.

"I just don’t think you’d actually do it. That would mean letting someone see me naked, and this outfit already pissed you off."

His claws dragged higher, slow and deliberate. "I could always order them to look away."

"Then what’s the point?" I smirked, thinking I had him.

"They’d still hear you scream my name," he whispered, his fingers teasing the edge of my sports bra. My breath hitched.

"They could also hear it if you left the window open," I dared, playing with fire.

"You’re lucky my father just called us to his office. But tonight?" His gaze burned into mine. "The window will be open." He kissed me hard before pulling away. "Change. Quickly."

I rolled my eyes but headed to the closet. The heat was unbearable, and I desperately wanted a shower. "Do I have to change?" I called out.

"No. Why? Changed your mind?" Sebastian leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed.

"I want to work out and check on my shop. It’s sweltering, and I’m already sticky."

"Fine. Let’s go." He shrugged and turned, holding the door open.

I bit back a sarcastic remark as I passed him, arms crossed, walking just ahead. The amusement radiating through our bond was infuriating.

When we reached the office, Sebastian knocked once before entering. We were the last to arrive. Audrey, Cassandra, and Luna Amelia sat on the far couch, with Cassandra stiff and visibly terrified while Audrey and Amelia tried to soothe her. Grayson, Nathan, Oliver, and Alpha Benjamin stood by the desk.

And to my irritation, Margaret sat in an armchair, slightly removed from the group.

###Chapter 0106

"Now that everyone's present..." Alpha Benjamin gave Sebastian a pointed look. The dark-haired Alpha seemed indifferent, leaning casually against the wall with his arms crossed. "Cassandra, come sit here." He gestured to the plush armchair directly across from his desk.

Cassandra trembled visibly as she stood, her gaze fixed on the floor as she shuffled toward the seat. "Yes, Alpha." Nathan's eyes never left her, his jaw clenched so tightly I could almost hear his teeth grinding. The air around him crackled with barely restrained fury.

"Nathan, can we talk outside?" I phrased it like a question, but it wasn't one. Alpha Benjamin and Sebastian both raised their brows in surprise, but Dad and Grayson jerked their chins toward the door, silently ordering him to go.

I didn’t wait to see if he’d follow—I knew he would. The moment the door clicked shut behind us, I whirled on him. "What the hell is wrong with you?"

His eyes darkened. "My problem? Are you serious?" A humorless laugh escaped him, as if he couldn’t believe I’d even ask.

"Yes, your problem! She’s your mate!"

"I know that!" His voice rose, then dropped into a growl. "A mate who flinches if I so much as breathe too close to her. A mate who’s clearly been through hell but won’t tell me anything!"

I scoffed. "Look at yourself! Would you trust someone who looks like they’re two seconds away from snapping? You’re radiating hostility like a damn storm cloud. She needs patience, not your temper. All you’ve shown her is rage. I’ve been in the same room as you both for three minutes, and even I can see she’s terrified of you!"

"I haven’t laid a hand on her!" Nathan snapped.

"Lower your damn voice," I hissed. "You don’t have to touch her to scare her. Think about how you were standing in there—arms crossed, glaring like she’d personally offended you just by existing. My guess? You’ve already lost your temper with her more than once for daring to be afraid." I crossed my arms, daring him to deny it.

His mouth opened, then closed. Instead of arguing, he let out a frustrated growl that vibrated through the walls. "This isn’t how it was supposed to be."

"I know," I said, softening my tone. "I’m sorry this is your reality. But that girl in there is terrified. She doesn’t need her own mate to be another thing she’s scared of. She needs you to be her safe place. Her protector. And that starts with controlling your damn emotions."

"Fuck." Nathan dragged his hands over his face before pacing away from me. "Scarlett, how the hell am I supposed to—"

"By being patient. By listening. The Moon Goddess didn’t pair you with her for no reason. Be the man she needs, and she’ll become the woman you need in return."

He exhaled sharply. "This is karma for every woman I ever treated like crap, isn’t it?"

I smirked. "I wasn’t going to say it, but..." Normally, I wasn’t one to kick someone when they were down, but the thought had crossed my mind.

Nathan groaned. "Alright, fine. Let’s go back in."

"Ready?" I asked, my hand on the doorknob.

He took a deep breath. "As I’ll ever be."

###Chapter 0107

"Yes." Nathan sighed as he opened the door. Every eye in the room turned toward us as we stepped back inside. Cassandra shot me a glare that screamed disapproval for taking her mate into the hallway. A low growl rumbled in her throat before her expression shifted—eyes widening, fear flooding them.

"Oh my Goddess! I'm so sorry!" Cassandra clapped a hand over her mouth, her face paling as she stared at me.

I laughed. "Relax. It's natural to be protective of your mate." I walked over and settled beside Audrey and Luna Amelia.

Nathan took the armchair next to Cassandra. Benjamin leaned forward, his voice steady. "Cassandra, what was your rank in your former pack?"

Her fingers still pressed against her lips, she whispered, "I-I was a maid. All women are maids there. No female ever holds rank."

"And your father?" Benjamin pressed.

She lowered her gaze, hands now clasped tightly in her lap. "He died when I was young. My mother said he was a warrior once."

Benjamin's jaw tightened. "Are you aware the Silvercrest Pack destroyed Evelyn’s tattoo parlor last week?"

Cassandra trembled violently, her eyes darting to me.

Rolling my eyes, I stood and moved in front of her, kneeling so our eyes met. "Cassandra, look at me."

She obeyed, tears glistening.

"Forget the men," I said, ignoring the irritated shift behind me—likely Benjamin. "This is just between us. You're safe here. No one will punish you for anything you say. No one will lay a hand on you. My word is law, and I promise you won’t face consequences for speaking the truth. You’re Nathan’s mate—that makes you family. We protect our own. You’ll never go back there." I covered her hands with mine.

She absorbed my words, shoulders relaxing slightly. "Okay."

"Tell me what you know about my shop."

"I-I was cleaning the bathroom when Alpha Dominic walked past with Alpha Damian. They were talking about mates—Alpha Dominic doesn’t believe in fated pairs. If a woman isn’t what they want, they... dispose of her." Her voice cracked. "There was a redhead—I don’t know if he rejected her. We hear screams from his room every night. No one’s allowed inside. After he took her, we never saw her again." Fresh tears spilled. "Alpha Dominic told his father he liked your fire. He wanted to break you, make you submit."

Bile burned my throat, but I kept my voice steady. "Did you hear anything else?"

She shook her head. "Once they noticed me, they—"

"That’s enough," I cut in gently. "You don’t have to relive it." I exhaled. "So no women hold rank?"

"None. Even Alpha Damian’s Luna. She doesn’t clean, but she oversees us. She’s beaten daily, just like us. If we fail, she’s punished too."

I nodded toward Audrey. "Do you know her?"

Cassandra followed my gaze. "She’s mated to Alpha Grayson."

"Right. I’m Grayson’s sister. We grew up together. Audrey’s been my assistant for years—kindest soul you’ll meet. She’s learning to be Luna, but your role here will mirror Nathan’s. He’s Gamma, so you’ll be Gamma Female. In this pack, women share their mate’s rank." I squeezed her hands. "But you need time to adjust. For the next few months, do whatever brings you joy. Cook, garden, help at the orphanage—your only job is to heal. Nathan will treat you like royalty. It’ll take patience, but the Moon Goddess paired you for a reason." I smirked. "Frankly, he could use a strong woman to keep him in line."

###Chapter 0108

Cassandra let out a soft chuckle, her gaze briefly flickering toward Nathan. "Alright."

"Why don't you and Audrey head to the kitchen for a snack? We'll wrap things up here, and if we have more questions, I'll have Audrey bring you back," Evelyn suggested.

"Yes, Luna." Cassandra offered her a small, hesitant smile.

"Please, call me Evelyn." Rising from her seat, Evelyn took Cassandra's hands and gently pulled her up. Audrey stepped forward, wrapping an arm around Cassandra's shoulders.

"Let me show you the way," Amelia said warmly, moving to open the office door. Only once they had left did Evelyn turn back and sink into her chair.

Nathan stood abruptly, his eyes fixed on the door. "Nathan, sit down," Evelyn commanded with a sigh. He complied, though his expression made it clear he wasn't happy about it.

"Evelyn—" Benjamin began.

"I'm sorry, Alpha Benjamin, but she's endured a lifetime of abuse. Being interrogated by a man wasn't going to make her open up."

"May I speak now?" He leaned back, arching an eyebrow.

"Of course. Go ahead."

"I was going to say—well done. I believe you'll make an exceptional Luna and be exactly what my son needs." A faint smile touched Benjamin's lips. Still irritated, Evelyn didn't return it.

"Thank you."

"Now, about what she said regarding Dominic..." Benjamin's gaze shifted to Alexander.

"He can't be allowed to get away with this!" Grayson growled, his anger barely contained.

"We can't just stand by and do nothing," Sebastian added, his voice deceptively calm. His eyes briefly flicked to Evelyn before returning to his father, his expression unreadable.

"Boys, we need to handle this strategically," Alexander interjected. "No one said we weren't going to act."

"Exactly. An eye for an eye," Benjamin agreed.

"But we need to maintain a public presence so it doesn't look like we had any involvement," Grayson pointed out.

"What if we throw a massive party at Moonhowl?" Nathan suggested.

"Ah, yes. My son has told me so much about her." Evelyn clenched her jaw, forcing herself to stay silent.

"That's the problem. She's mated and marked to my son. She has zero interest in yours, and I'm calling to demand that he stays away from her. He is forbidden from entering her tattoo parlor or engaging with her under any circumstances."

Theodore laughed. "Alpha Benjamin, they merely crossed paths the other day. He's spoken to her twice at most. If his presence has affected her enough for you to intervene, I have to wonder why that is. Perhaps he does stir something in her?"

"I assure you, that's not the case. She finds him utterly repulsive, and that little stunt he pulled at last night's party was equally appalling. Need I remind you that your pack members severely overstepped with Cassandra?"

"Alpha Benjamin, boys will be boys. She's under Alpha Alexander's protection now, so there's no need to discuss Cassandra further. As for Evelyn, my son is young and saw someone who intrigued him. You can't tell me Sebastian or Grayson have never flirted before. Isn't Grayson's gamma, Nathan, what the kids call a 'playboy'? Frankly, I'm shocked he even wanted to mate with Cassandra in the first place!"

"Alpha Theodore, hear me loud and clear—Dominic stays away from Evelyn, or the next conversation won't be a courtesy call."

###Chapter 0109
Sebastian POV

"She didn't buy it at all," I muttered, glancing at Grayson.

"I didn't expect her to, but I'm shocked she didn't argue," Grayson sighed, turning to Alpha Alexander. "We can't let Dominic anywhere near her."

"Agreed. That little performance at the party was a direct insult." Alpha Alexander's composure finally cracked. His face flushed red, his wolf simmering beneath the surface.

"What do you propose? Sending warriors after him isn't an option—he'd have his men with him, and it'd be an open declaration of war." My father leaned back in his chair. Our pack was known for its ruthlessness, but this required strategy, not brute force.

"He walked into her shop and asked for a tattoo," I announced to the room.

"The hell he did!" Grayson snarled, his temper flaring.

"I agree. She can't tattoo him. That’s what started this mess in the first place."

"Maybe we should reach out to Alpha Damian," my father suggested, rubbing his temples. "A conversation about Evelyn might be a good starting point. Cover our bases before things escalate."

"Call him now," I demanded, my voice sharper than intended. My father shot me a warning look, but Grayson backed me up.

"I agree. I want to hear this conversation."

With a resigned sigh, my father grabbed the phone. "Put it on speaker," I said as he dialed.

Ring.

Ring.

Ri— "Alpha Benjamin. This is unexpected," Alpha Damian's voice echoed through the room.

"I thought it prudent we speak," my father replied, his tone authoritative. "Certain developments have come to my attention—ones I find unacceptable. I’d like to resolve this peacefully."

"And what developments would those be?" Damian sounded bored.

"Evelyn Andrews."

"Ah, yes. My son has mentioned her quite a bit." My jaw clenched, but I forced myself to stay silent.

"That’s the problem. She’s mated and marked to my son. She has zero interest in Dominic, and I’m formally requesting he stay away from her. He is not to enter her tattoo parlor or engage with her under any circumstances."

Alpha Damian chuckled. "Alpha Benjamin, they’ve only crossed paths twice. If his mere presence has you this worked up, perhaps she is affected by him?"

"Let me be clear—she finds him repulsive. And that stunt he pulled at the party last night? Disgraceful. You know damn well what happened was a violation against Cassandra."

"Alpha Benjamin, boys will be boys. Cassandra is under Alpha Alexander’s protection, so let’s leave her out of this. As for Evelyn, my son is young and intrigued. You can’t tell me Sebastian or Grayson have never flirted before. Isn’t Grayson’s beta, Nathan, some kind of... what’s the term... playboy? Frankly, I’m surprised he even wanted to mate with Cassandra!"

"Alpha Damian," my father’s voice turned lethal. "This is your only warning. Keep Dominic away from Evelyn, or the next conversation won’t be this civil."

###Chapter 0110

"Is that a threat?" Alpha Damian's voice dropped to a dangerous growl.

"Take it however you want," I countered, my grip tightening around the phone. "But I won't tolerate any harassment toward the future Luna of my pack. Consider this your only warning."

"Let the best man win," Damian sneered before abruptly ending the call.

"Damn it!" My control shattered as my fist slammed through the wall, leaving a gaping hole in its wake.

Grayson's entire body vibrated with barely contained fury. "We need to make a statement. And soon."

"Evelyn doesn't step foot outside without an escort," I snarled.

"Agreed." Alexander's eyes still glowed with the presence of his wolf. Margaret opened her mouth to speak but wisely closed it after one sharp look from her mate.

"Alright. Head home for now. Alexander, I'll call you later with the details."

"Sounds good." I strode to the door and held it open as they filed out. Alexander exited first, followed by Nathan, but Grayson paused in front of me.

"Keep my sister safe." His words weren't a request—they were a demand.

"With my life," I vowed in a low voice.

No one commented on our exchange as we all moved toward the kitchen, where laughter spilled into the hallway. My mother's voice was the loudest, but Evelyn's melodic laughter was unmistakable.

Rounding the corner, I found them all gathered around the table. Cassandra was even smiling as my mother and Evelyn exchanged stories. Audrey blushed furiously, shaking her head in embarrassment.

"Ladies," I announced our arrival.

Cassandra immediately fell silent, her expression darkening. I pressed a kiss to Evelyn's head before taking the seat beside her. "What's so amusing?"

"Evelyn was just telling us about the time Audrey face-planted at the school carnival," Evelyn grinned up at me.

"I bet that was a sight," I chuckled.

Grayson dropped into the chair beside Audrey. "Oh, I remember that!" Audrey turned away, her cheeks flaming red.

"Did you get the update you needed?" I asked Evelyn.

"Yes. The cabinets and flooring are going in tomorrow. They need more painting done, so I'm heading over now to finish it."

"Ah, yes. My son has told me so much about her." I clenched my jaw, forcing myself to stay silent.

"That's the problem," I said through gritted teeth. "She's mated and marked to my son. She wants nothing to do with yours, and I'm formally demanding that he stay away from her. He is banned from her tattoo parlor and any form of contact."

Damian laughed. "Alexander, they've only crossed paths twice. If she's so affected that you're stepping in, I have to wonder—maybe my son does have an effect on her?"

"Not a chance," I snapped. "She finds him repulsive, and that little stunt he pulled at the party last night was disgraceful. And let's not forget what your pack members did to Cassandra."

"Alexander, boys will be boys. She's with your pack now, so let's drop the Cassandra issue. As for Evelyn, my son is young and intrigued. Don't tell me Sebastian or Grayson have never flirted before. Isn't Nathan known as a... what do they call it... a playboy? Frankly, I'm shocked he even mated Cassandra in the first place!"

"Damian," my voice turned lethal. "This is your final warning. Keep Dominic away from Evelyn, or the next conversation won't be so civil."

###Chapter 0111

"Well, duty calls. See you both later!" Mom gave us a warm smile before heading out.

Evelyn twisted in her seat, swinging one leg over to straddle me. "Care to explain why you lied?"

"Can't we have a little mystery between us?" I exhaled dramatically as I stood, pulling her up with me.

"Absolutely not." I led her upstairs toward my private library.

"Why are we here?" Evelyn questioned. I shut the door behind us and turned the lock.

"This is my sanctuary. Since I know you won’t let me handle things alone, I wanted to tell you here." I sank into one side of the couch and patted the space beside me.

"I have a bad feeling about this." Evelyn sat facing me, one knee drawn up on the cushion. She propped her head on her hand, elbow resting against the back of the couch.

"Me too. But I promised we’d be equals, and I meant it. Honestly, I’d rather not tell you any of this—I just want you happy and stress-free."

"Sweet sentiment. Now talk." Her eyes narrowed.

"You know Dominic has developed an unhealthy obsession with you." I watched as her expression darkened—she already knew she wouldn’t like where this was going. "Dad called Alpha Damian to smooth things over."

"Let me guess—it backfired?" She rolled her eyes, gaze drifting to the window.

"Exactly. He dismissed what happened to Cassandra as 'boys being boys.'" Evelyn whipped her head back toward me, horrified. I held up a finger to stop her. "Then he said you 'intrigued' his son and that there was no harm in it. Ended with 'let the best man win.'"

"You’re joking." Her voice was flat with disbelief.

"Not the exact words, but that’s the gist. He made it clear Dominic won’t respect that you’re my mate. He’ll try to win you over himself."

Evelyn’s jaw dropped. Shock, anger, and fear pulsed through our bond.

"That’s insane."

"Dad banned you from tattooing him. Obviously."

"Obviously." Sarcasm dripped from her words.

BONUS

"And you’ll have a guard with you at all times." She opened her mouth to protest, but I pressed a finger to her lips. "Don’t even try. Grayson, your dad—everyone agrees. I..." I hesitated, searching for the right words. "I need this. For my sanity. I can’t lose you, Evelyn. Please don’t fight me on this." I clasped her hands, pouring every ounce of sincerity into my voice.

It must have worked—she stayed silent, gaze dropping to our intertwined fingers. An internal war raged behind her eyes. Just as I was about to speak, she shifted, straddling me again. Her palms cradled my face as mine settled on her hips.

"I’ll agree—but only if I choose who it is."

"Love, it’ll only ever be me, Grayson, or Oliver. No strangers guarding you." I cupped the back of her head, drawing her down until our foreheads touched.

Our kiss was soft, more comfort than passion. She lingered close, eyes closed, drawing strength from the contact. "I won’t pretend he doesn’t creep me out. I hate him near me."

"Let me protect you. No leaving pack lands without me. No adventures until this is settled. Okay?" She buried her face in my shoulder.

"Okay."

###Chapter 0112

That went smoother than I anticipated.

I was simply gazing out the window, enjoying a rare moment of peace with Evelyn curled up beside me when a searing pain shot through my mark. My body responded instantly, arousal flooding my system as the pain transformed into overwhelming pleasure. Before I could react, I came hard in my shorts.

My fingers dug into Evelyn's fur as the waves of pleasure subsided, only to feel her rough tongue cleaning the mark she'd just claimed.

"What. The. Actual. Hell. Evelyn?" My chest heaved with each ragged breath. I shoved her off me, grimacing at the sticky mess in my shorts.

"I..." Evelyn was laughing so hard she could barely breathe, tears streaming down her face. Without another word, I unlocked the door and stormed straight to our bedroom to change.

Never in a million years had I considered the implications of casually marking someone like that. This meant war.

"S-Sebastian!" Evelyn burst into the bedroom as I was cleaning up in the bathroom. I'd already grabbed fresh underwear and shorts.

"What do you want?" I snapped, still irritated.

"I'm sorry," she gasped between giggles, "but you can't deny you enjoyed that." She leaned against the doorframe, watching me dress with amusement.

"Besides, you promised me an entire day together."

"I did," I admitted, pulling on my shirt. "After that little stunt, we're going to the gym."

"The gym?" Her eyes sparkled with mischief. "I can think of better ways to work up a sweat." She reached for me as I walked past.

"Nope," I dodged her grasp. "Already got my release. I'm good." I shot her a look as I opened the bedroom door.

"Well, shit." Evelyn pouted dramatically. "Thought getting you off would improve your mood."

As she passed me, I delivered a sharp smack to her ass. "Oh, I'm in an excellent mood."

"OW!" She yelped, grabbing her stinging cheek as she spun around. "That's going to leave a mark!"

Wrapping an arm around her shoulders, I steered her down the hall. "We've never trained together before. This should be interesting."

"I have a feeling I'm going to hate you by sunset," she muttered, shooting me a glare.

"Oh darling," I purred, pushing open the gym doors. "By nightfall, you'll be screaming my name loud enough for the entire pack to hear."

The crowded gym silenced any retort she might have made, but the fire in her eyes promised this wasn't over.

"It's sweltering out here," Evelyn complained, squinting at the midday sun.

"Indeed it is." I raised an eyebrow. "Ready?"

She glared at the forest like it had personally offended her. "Always."

Damn, this woman's stubbornness knew no bounds. I gave her five miles tops before she'd break. We started with a light jog along the perimeter wall marking our territory.

"This is the boundary," I explained as we ran. "It encircles the entire pack lands."

"What?" She panted, bent over clutching her side. "No laser fences or anything?"

"Just landmines and poison darts," I deadpanned. "Need to stop?"

"Nope," she straightened with visible effort. "Just admiring the... scenery." She pushed past me with forced determination.

"Excellent," I smirked. "Then you can lead."

Her exasperated sigh was music to my ears as she took off running along the wall. Watching her perfect ass move as she ran was the most delicious distraction. This was turning into the most enjoyable run of my life.

We'd gone about three miles when she suddenly grabbed a tree for support. "Fine! I surrender. No more running." She glared at me, chest heaving, while I barely broke a sweat.

###Chapter 0113

My body reacted instantly as I watched Evelyn move with effortless grace, completing eight perfect squats before stepping back. "Your turn." There was a defiant challenge in her smirk. Maybe I should've increased the weight more.

Adjusting the bar to 250lbs, I positioned myself beneath it. Eight controlled reps later, I yielded the space to her again. She casually reset the weight to 160lbs, performing another flawless set like it was nothing. But when she finished, those mischievous fingers slid the pin to 275lbs for me.

"Think you can handle that, Mr. Alpha?" Her tongue darted out to tease her canine, that dangerous mix of flirtation and challenge sparking in her eyes.

"Without breaking a sweat." The lie came smoothly, though the burn in my thighs begged to differ. In retaliation, I nudged her weight up another notch. "Let's see if you can keep up."

"Piece of cake." That infuriating smirk never left her face as she executed the squats with perfect form, though I didn't miss the subtle tremble in her thighs afterward. "Told you," she panted, sweat glistening on her collarbone.

"Excellent. Now for presses." I guided us toward the squat rack, completing my set before Evelyn took her turn. Her poker face was impressive, but those shaking legs betrayed her. Rather than increasing her weight, I simply added two extra reps to her set.

After finishing our calf exercises, Evelyn collapsed onto a bench. "Here." I grabbed two chilled waters from the cooler, handing one to her.

"Thanks." She gulped thirstily, though I noticed how her thighs still quivered despite her efforts to hide it. "I was thinking we should walk the perimeter. You should familiarize yourself with the entire territory."

Our eyes locked in silent battle. We both knew that meant miles of rugged terrain under the blazing sun. "Perfect idea." Her eyelashes fluttered defiantly.

"Sure you're not too sore?" I prodded.

"Please. I could run it if I wanted." She tossed her hair, that stubborn pride shining through.

"Then let's jog." I turned without cracking a smile, hearing her frustrated exhale as she scrambled to follow. The midday sun beat down mercilessly as we reached the forest edge. I deliberately slowed my pace, giving her a chance to recover before calling her bluff. Tossing my empty bottle into a bin, I waited for her to do the same.

"Fucking sauna out here," Evelyn muttered, squinting at the sky.

"Indeed. Ready?" I raised a challenging brow. She glared at the tree line like it had personally offended her.

"Born ready." That infuriating stubbornness. I gave her five miles tops before she'd break. We set off at a steady jog along the boundary wall marking our territory.

"This marks our eastern border. The wall encircles the entire pack lands."

"No laser grids? Motion sensors?" Evelyn bent over, hands on her knees.

"Just landmines and poison-tipped arrows." My lips twitched. "Need to stop?"

"Just admiring the... breathtaking... scenery." She straightened with visible effort and marched past me.

"Wonderful. You lead then." I fell in step behind her, thoroughly enjoying the view as she resumed jogging. The way her athletic shorts hugged her curves made this the most enjoyable patrol I'd ever run.

We continued until she suddenly grabbed a tree for support. "Fine! I surrender. No more jogging." Her glare could've melted steel as she took in my barely elevated breathing.

###Chapter 0114

"You made it six miles. I thought you'd give up at five, so color me impressed." I smirked, watching her legs tremble. "Though I’m shocked you lasted this long."

"Go to hell," Evelyn panted, glaring at me between ragged breaths.

I just chuckled at her defiance. "Come on." I held out my hand, and she took it, letting me steady her as we continued walking.

After a few minutes, she finally spoke again. "How are you not even sore?"

"I’m an Alpha. We don’t get tired." The lie rolled off my tongue easily.

She stumbled right then, but thankfully, my grip kept her upright.

"Need me to carry you?"

She shot me a withering look but ignored the offer. "I just haven’t trained in a week. And I was injured."

"Poor little Luna," I teased. "Let me show you something."

We reached a deep creek that cut through our territory. A small waterfall cascaded into a crystal-clear pond before the water continued downstream.

"This is beautiful," Evelyn murmured, releasing my hand to step closer to the edge.

"Yes. Beautiful." My gaze lingered on her, not the scenery.

She kicked off her shoes and socks, sitting on a flat rock to dip her feet into the water. A sigh escaped her lips as the coolness soothed her. "This feels amazing."

Tilting her head back, she closed her eyes, letting the sunlight catch the sweat glistening on her skin.

"Let’s go for a swim," I suggested.

She blinked at me. "What?"

"Yeah. A swim." I mind-linked the patrol. Stay clear of the pond.

Yes, Alpha. They knew better than to question me.

"What if someone sees us?" Evelyn glanced around nervously.

I was already pulling off my shirt. "No one will."

My shoes and socks followed. Then my shorts.

I stood there, completely bare before her, relishing the way her eyes raked over me. The heat in her gaze sent a shiver down my spine.

Without hesitation, I stepped past her and leaped off the waterfall, plunging into the pond below. The water was refreshing, crisp against my skin.

"It’s so damn hot out here," Evelyn muttered, shielding her eyes as she looked up at the sky.

"Yeah, it is." I arched a brow at her. "Ready?"

She eyed the woods like they were her enemy.

"Always."

Damn, she was stubborn. But I’d give her five more miles before she caved.

We started jogging again, following the perimeter wall that marked our pack’s boundary.

"This is the edge. It circles the entire territory," I explained.

"What, no lasers or force fields?" She was bent over, clutching her side.

"Nope. Just bombs and poison darts," I deadpanned. "Need a break?"

She straightened, brushing past me. "Nope. Just admiring the stunning view."

"Great. Lead the way, then."

I let her take the front, watching as she exhaled sharply before breaking into a run. The sight of her in motion—her tight form, the way her muscles flexed—was intoxicating. This was easily the most enjoyable run I’d ever had.

We kept going until she suddenly stopped, bracing herself against a tree.

"Fine! I give up. I can’t run anymore." She glowered at me, chest heaving, while I barely broke a sweat.

###Chapter 0115

"This isn't funny. The thought of losing you isn't a joke to me." I sank deeper into the water, my hand gripping Evelyn's a ss firmly.

"Mmm, can I make it up to you?" Her voice was husky as she traced my ear with her tongue. One hand braced against my shoulder while the other wrapped around my already hard d ick. Damn, I loved a woman who took charge.

"You can try," I growled as she pressed her t its against me, her l*ps crashing into mine. Her fingers stroked me with purpose, sending sparks down my spine.

I parted her legs, sliding two fingers inside her without hesitation. She gasped against my mouth, her grip on me faltering as I worked her relentlessly, my thumb circling her cl it.

"Oh f uck!" Her head fell back as her legs wrapped around me. I didn’t waste a second—I thrust into her in one smooth motion. Her nails dug into my shoulders as she cried out.

Lifting her, I carried her to a nearby rock, laying her half in and half out of the water. Her back arched against the stone, giving me full access. I slowed my pace, focusing on her t its instead, teasing the sensitive spot inside her left one that drove her wild.

Her hips bucked, but I wasn’t ready to let her finish yet.

I pulled her fully onto the rock, her a ss barely out of the water, just enough for me to taste her.

"Oh! Oh! Oh!" Evelyn moaned, her fingers tangling in my hair as she rode my face. Her thighs trembled around me, but I stopped just before she peaked.

Grabbing her, I dragged her back into the water and slammed into her again.

Our rhythm matched perfectly, my hands gripping her hips as I drove into her. Her legs were tired, so I took control, moving us both toward the edge.

When her climax hit, mine followed. I would’ve let her ride it out, but Evelyn suddenly wiggled free and pushed me against the wall.

"What—?"

She didn’t answer, just tried to lift me. Confused, I climbed out of the water and sat on the edge.

Without warning, she took my still-hard d ick into her mouth.

"F uuccckkk." My head fell back as she worked me expertly, her tongue swirling as she took me deep. Her fingers massaged my balls, pushing me closer until I came hard down her throat.

When I looked down, she was licking her l*ps clean, a satisfied smirk on her face.

"Fine." I treaded water as she stripped completely and jumped in after me. There was something about a woman emerging from the water that made my d ick twitch all over again.

"This does feel amazing."

I turned to show her something, but two hands shoved me under. As a wolf, I was a strong swimmer. I dove deeper, grabbing her ankle and pulling her down with me.

Kicking off the bottom, I shot back to the surface—but Evelyn was gone.

My heart stopped when I saw her lying motionless at the bottom, bubbles escaping her parted l*ps.

"F uck!" I dove down, wrapping my arm around her and hauling her up.

"Evelyn!" I laid her on a rock, shaking her slightly before pressing my ear to her mouth—only for something wet to wiggle inside. "EWW!" I jerked back as she burst out laughing.

"I scared you!" She grinned, still leaning against the rocks.

Growling, I pinned her against the stone, my hand at her throat, forcing her to meet my gaze. "Don’t ever do that again." My pulse was still racing.

Evelyn wrapped her arms around my waist, her arousal pulsing through the bond. "It was just a joke," she murmured, her eyes locked on my l*ps.

I wasn’t laughing.

###Chapter 0116
Evelyn POV

That damn bastard... My body trembled one final time before I lifted my head to meet Sebastian's amused gaze. His lips twitched with suppressed laughter, but his iron grip kept me from pulling away. My hardened nipples brushed against his chest, sending fresh sparks of desire through me.

"Mmm, I definitely enjoyed that," he murmured, finally letting that devastating half-smile break free. God, he was the most irresistible man I'd ever laid eyes on. That smirk alone had my legs trembling like jelly.

"Is that so?" I pressed myself flush against him again, purposefully making water splash up between my breasts to hit his face.

"This changes nothing," he said, blinking droplets from his lashes.

"What do you mean?"

"Nothing." His voice turned gruff. "Ready to continue our walk?"

"Can't we stay here a little longer?" I licked my lips deliberately, letting my gaze drop meaningfully to where his arousal strained against his wet pants.

Sebastian growled and suddenly seized the back of my neck, crushing his mouth to mine in a kiss that shot straight to my core. I wanted him—needed him—to take me right there against the rocks.

With brutal efficiency, he spun me around and pinned me against the stone ledge. His fingers plunged into me without warning. "OH GOD! DON'T STOP!" My scream echoed off the canyon walls as his relentless fingers worked me into a frenzy.

Then he was inside me, filling me completely while his other hand explored new territory that made me gasp. "Relax," he breathed against my ear as his fingers stretched me in ways I'd never experienced. The initial sting gave way to overwhelming pleasure as he moved in perfect rhythm.

I reached between us to heighten my own pleasure, clinging to his shoulders for support. When Sebastian added a second finger to that forbidden place, I shattered completely. My cries sent birds scattering from the trees as he followed me over the edge with a primal growl.

Only when our breathing steadied did he speak again. "I think you enjoyed that."

Resting my forehead against his shoulder, I teased, "You think?"

"Come on." He helped me stand on shaky legs. "We should keep moving. But I promise there'll be more of that later."

"We can dry off in the sun," I suggested as we waded to shore. Every muscle in my body ached deliciously—my thighs trembled and that new, sensitive area still burned from his attention.

After wringing out our clothes, we stretched out on the warm rocks. "Have you... done that before?" I asked hesitantly.

"Done what?" Sebastian lay with his arms behind his head, eyes closed against the sunlight. Even with our mate bond, his thoughts remained frustratingly opaque sometimes.

"Come out here to... you know." I couldn't meet his eyes, suddenly unsure I wanted the answer.

Sebastian turned his head to study me. "No. Believe it or not, I saved certain things for my mate. I wasn't a virgin, but I never went that far with anyone else."

"What about... the other part?"

"Yes."

My heart sank as I reached for my clothes. "Oh."

Sebastian didn't elaborate as we dressed in silence. I finished first and began braiding my tangled hair as he tied his boots. When I heard twigs snap behind me, I knew he'd caught up.

The forest truly was breathtaking—birds flitted between branches, squirrels chased each other up towering oaks, and butterflies danced across wildflowers. We walked for miles without speaking, simply enjoying nature's symphony.

To our right, an ancient stone wall rose about eight feet high, its surface covered in ivy and moss. Parts of it dated back to revolutionary times, with newer sections added over generations. The Blackwood territory held so much history—every rock and tree seemed to whisper secrets of the past.

###Chapter 0117

A sudden gust of wind carried a familiar scent that made my entire body tense. My instincts screamed danger. "Seb-?" Sebastian began to speak but I silenced him with a raised hand.

"Do you smell that?" I whispered through the mind-link.

"Smell what?" His green eyes darkened with concern as he scanned our surroundings, muscles coiled for action.

"Rogues."

Sebastian's head snapped toward me. I pointed silently at the stone wall, and understanding flashed in his eyes. He moved like shadow, fingertips barely grazing the rough surface as he pulled himself up for a quick peek. The moment his feet touched ground again, he signaled for me to take cover.

"You're right." I pressed against an oak tree, the voices of rogues now audible beyond the barrier. "Stay low. I've alerted our warriors."

"How many?"

"At least twelve." My stomach twisted. We could handle a few, but this was too many.

Sebastian's jaw tightened. "You need to retreat. Now."

"Like hell I will!" My whisper came out sharper than intended. "I'm not leaving you to face them alone."

His eyes burned with protective fury. "I won't risk you!"

Before he could argue further, I closed my eyes and summoned Luna. The shift came effortlessly - one moment human, the next standing on four silver-tipped paws. Sebastian transformed simultaneously, his massive black wolf form materializing beside me.

The first rogue cleared the wall just as Sebastian completed his shift. The attacker landed on his back with a snarl. Without hesitation, Luna launched herself through the air. Her jaws clamped around the rogue's throat as she used the wall to flip them both, landing with the enemy beneath her. Warm blood sprayed across her muzzle.

Snarls erupted around us. More rogues poured over the wall. Sebastian battled three simultaneously while two circled me.

They attacked in perfect coordination - one lunging for my throat while the other went for my hind legs. Luna twisted mid-air, her claws raking across one attacker's face while narrowly avoiding the other's snapping jaws. Then crushing weight slammed onto my back, sharp pain exploding through my shoulder.

Luna reared up, slamming the rogue against the wall with enough force to crack stone. The remaining attacker shifted to human form. "Don't kill her!" he barked. The teeth withdrew from my flesh. "That's the one we want! Take her alive!"

Panic ignited Luna's fury. She became pure, lethal motion - launching off the pinned rogue to tear open the shouting man's throat. Before his body hit the ground, she whirled to sink teeth into another's thigh, flinging him into a tree. A dark shape intercepted the falling rogue - our warriors had arrived.

"KEEP ONE ALIVE!" I howled to Sebastian. The tide turned instantly. Where Sebastian fought, his opponent went limp rather than dead. Our warriors followed suit.

My mind reeled. Why would rogues want me? This pathetic kidnapping attempt made no sense. Luna paced anxiously among the fallen, her silver coat streaked crimson.

"Evelyn." Sebastian's voice pulled me from my thoughts. He stood human again, holding out a t-shirt while warriors dressed around us. The lone surviving rogue groaned at his feet.

###Chapter 0118

I snatched the shirt and darted behind a thick oak tree. In seconds, I shifted back to human form and pulled the fabric over my head. My hands trembled slightly as I lingered there, trying to steady my breathing.

It wasn’t the ambush that unsettled me. Nor was it the metallic scent of blood or the lifeless bodies scattered across the ground.

It was his words.

The rogue’s chilling declaration echoed in my mind.

Taking a deep breath, I stepped out from behind the tree and made my way back to the chaotic scene.

"What the hell happened?" Alpha Benjamin’s voice cut through the air like a whip.

Sebastian spotted me and immediately gestured for me to come to him. The warriors parted to let me through, but my legs felt unsteady. One of them gripped my arm, guiding me forward until I reached Sebastian. His arm wrapped around my waist, firm and possessive.

"We were patrolling the border," I said, my voice steadier than I felt. "I wanted Evelyn to learn our territory."

"And?" Alpha Benjamin’s impatience was palpable.

"A sudden gust of wind carried their scent," Sebastian interjected. "I saw them—rogues. I told her to run, but she refused." His jaw clenched. "Good thing she didn’t. Seconds later, one was on my back."

I swallowed hard, remembering the terror of seeing him vulnerable.

"I’d already shifted by then. My wolf took over and killed the rogue. Then the rest attacked. Sebastian was fighting three, maybe four at once. So was I."

"You’re bleeding," Alpha Benjamin noted sharply, nodding at the dark stain spreading across my shirt.

Sebastian tugged at the collar, his fingers brushing my skin as he examined the wound.

"It’s nothing serious," I muttered. "One of them bit me, but another rogue shifted and stopped him. Said they weren’t supposed to kill me—that I was the one they wanted."

Sebastian’s grip on me tightened. His fingers dug into my side as he tore the fabric further, revealing the bite marks. They weren’t deep, but they burned like hell.

"What do you mean, the one they wanted?" His voice was a low, dangerous growl.

"I don’t know!" I snapped, frustration bubbling up. "That’s why I told you to keep one alive! He literally shouted ‘catch her’ before attacking!"

"I told you to run!" Sebastian snarled, his anger radiating off him in waves.

He wasn’t just mad—he was furious. Not at me, but at the situation. At the fact that I’d been hurt.

"And I told you no!" I shoved away from him, ignoring the sharp sting in my shoulder. "If I’d left, you’d be dead! Your warriors took too long to get here! You were outnumbered—no way you could’ve taken them all alone!"

"Luna, let’s get you to the infirmary," Oliver interjected carefully, stepping forward.

He was probably the only one brave enough to speak right now—or maybe he just wanted to defuse the tension.

"Don’t touch me, Oliver!" I swatted his hand away, glaring at Sebastian as I crossed my arms. The movement pulled at my wound, but I refused to show any weakness.

"Enough." Alpha Benjamin raised his hands. "Here’s what we’re doing. Take the surviving rogues to the cells. We’ll interrogate them when they wake up. Dispose of the dead ones." He turned to Sebastian. "Are you hurt?"

"No." Sebastian’s gaze never left me, his eyes burning with barely restrained fury.

"Good. We’ll handle this." Alpha Benjamin turned to me. "Evelyn, go to the infirmary."

I opened my mouth to argue, but he held up a finger.

"Your father and brother will have my head if anything happens to you. Go."

I exhaled sharply. "Fine."

I stormed past them, ignoring Oliver’s outstretched hand.

"Oliver, stay here," Sebastian growled before I felt his presence behind me, following close.

###Chapter 0119

The adrenaline that had been coursing through my veins was fading with every step I took. The blood on my arm had stopped flowing, drying into dark streaks under the summer sun. The rogue’s command echoed in my mind like a haunting whisper. "Catch her!"

Who would want me? The only name that surfaced was Dominic. The thought of being taken against my will sent a chill down my spine. My legs grew heavier with exhaustion, my vision blurring at the edges. When my foot caught on a fallen log, I stumbled forward, landing hard on my hands and knees.

Tears welled up, and a choked sob escaped my lips before I could stop it. Strong arms wrapped around my waist, lifting me effortlessly. The moment my body pressed against his, warmth spread through me like wildfire. Sebastian sat on the log, settling me onto his lap.

His hand moved in slow circles over my back. "I'm sorry."

I blinked up at him, confused. "For what?" A tear slipped free, tracing a path down my cheek.

"You had to kill someone. Even if he was a rogue... he was still a person."

I nearly laughed in disbelief. "That’s what you think is bothering me?"

"Isn’t it?"

"No." My voice was steady despite the tremor in my hands. "That wasn’t my first time. Remember the car crash?"

"I do, but you didn’t kill anyone then. And there weren’t a dozen of them."

"Sebastian," I said, gripping his shirt, "since I’ve known you, I’ve survived three rogue attacks. The first time, when Grayson was run off the road—I did kill someone. The second time, I saved your life when you were shot. And now, today." I swallowed hard. "I’m not afraid of rogues. I’m afraid of losing you. Seeing that rogue on your back—" My voice cracked as my fingers brushed over the nearly healed bite marks on his shoulder. "Sebastian, if I’m right, they wanted to kidnap me."

The word sent a violent shudder through me. Kidnapping. It was a nightmare on par with my worst fears.

"Shh." Sebastian cradled my face, his thumbs wiping away my tears. "I’d die before I let anyone take you. I swear it." He pulled me against his chest, and I let myself crumble, the last remnants of terror spilling out in silent sobs.

When I finally calmed, Sebastian stood, lifting me into his arms without a word. I didn’t protest. The world blurred around us until we reached the hospital. The sterile air raised goosebumps on my skin as nurses rushed forward with a gurney.

"Luna Evelyn, we’ll get you patched up, okay?"

"I’m fine," I insisted weakly. "This is overkill."

"Let them do their job," Sebastian muttered, rubbing his temples.

I exhaled sharply as the nurse pressed against my wounds. "Does that hurt?"

I shot her a look. "I was bitten half an hour ago. What do you think?"

She flinched. "S-sorry, Luna." She hurried out, replaced by another nurse who worked in silence.

"Evelyn," Sebastian sighed, arms crossed, his expression stormy.

"I don’t want to hear it," I cut in. "I did what I had to. These wounds will heal before prom. You won’t even see them."

"Do you want to call Alpha Alexander, or should I?"

"I’ll do it." I held out my hand for a phone.

Sebastian shook his head. "Don’t have mine. We’ll call when we get home."

The nurse finished cleaning the wounds, administering a shot before stepping back. "Anything broken?"

"I don’t think so." I flexed my arm experimentally.

"Up to you if you want an X-ray."

"I’m fine." All I wanted was to leave.

"Alright. No stitches, so let them scab naturally. If you notice redness, come back—it could be infected. I gave you antibiotics as a precaution. Any questions?"

I shook my head.

Sebastian scooped me up again, his grip firm. "Let’s go home."

###Chapter 0120

"No. I think I'm good."

"Alright, have a good rest of the day, Alpha Sebastian, Luna Evelyn." She gave a slight bow before exiting the room.

"Thank you," I called after her just before the door closed. Her steps faltered for a brief second, but she didn’t turn back.

Sliding off the bed, Sebastian reached out to steady me, his grip firm but gentle.

"Let’s go," he said, nodding toward the door.

I followed, my stomach twisting with dread. This phone call wasn’t going to be pleasant.

The walk to the packhouse was silent, the distance between us stretching wider than usual. His hands hung at his sides, his expression unreadable. Meanwhile, I felt painfully exposed in my torn shirt, the cool evening air brushing against my skin.

When we arrived, a warrior stood guard outside the door—an unusual sight that I made a mental note to question Sebastian about later. For now, I headed straight to our room.

Inside, I tore off the ruined shirt and pulled on a simple pair of shorts and a snug tank top with a built-in bra. Sebastian helped adjust the fabric so it wouldn’t irritate the bite mark on my shoulder.

"Let’s go to your father’s office to make the call," he said as we stepped out of the closet.

"Why?"

"He was going to contact him anyway about the rogue locations," Sebastian replied with a shrug.

"Fine. But it’s getting late. Can we just have food brought up to our room and turn in early?"

"That’s fine," he muttered, barely glancing at me before striding out of the bedroom.

Sebastian knocked once on his father’s office door before pushing it open.

"Alexander, your daughter just walked in, and she has something to tell you," Alpha Benjamin said, frowning. He hit the speakerphone button before setting the receiver down.

"Okay? What’s wrong?" My father’s voice filled the room.

"Hey, Dad," I said, my voice quieter than I intended.

"Evelyn? What’s going on?"

"Dad, I don’t want you to get angry."

"Damn it, Evelyn. What did you do?" His sharp tone made me flinch.

"Hey! I didn’t do anything!" I snapped defensively.

Sebastian let out a quiet snort before dropping into a chair.

"Yeah, okay. Just tell me what happened."

"Sebastian was showing me the perimeter of their land…" I began.

"Good. You need to know those things." I could practically see him nodding in approval.

"Yeah, well, a gust of wind hit us, and I caught the scent of rogues. Sebastian looked over, and there were about a dozen of them. He told me to run, but I didn’t listen. We had maybe a minute before they reached us. We shifted, but one rogue had already scaled the wall and landed on Sebastian. Luna jumped in and saved him, but I got bit on the shoulder in the process."

"I’m glad Luna acted quickly, but I don’t see why this is such a big deal. You’ve fought rogues before. I trust you handled it until their warriors arrived."

His confidence in my skills made me shoot Sebastian a smug told-you-so look. He rolled his eyes in response.

"Well, at one point, one of the rogues shifted back and said, ‘That’s her—get her!’ or something like that. Basically, they were after me."

"WHAT?" My father’s voice boomed through the office.

"As soon as I heard that, I told Sebastian to keep some alive. We have a few rogues in the cells and will interrogate them when they wake up."

"What’s being done about my daughter’s safety?" Dad demanded.

"She’ll have a guard with her at all times," Sebastian answered. "I’ve increased warrior posts around the pack and doubled border patrol. Once they wake up, I suspect we’ll find they were sent by Silvercrest Pack."

"You think so?" Dad asked Alpha Benjamin.

"Sebastian, Evelyn… why don’t you let me and Alexander handle this from here," Alpha Benjamin said, taking the call off speakerphone and turning his back to us.

I hated being dismissed like this.

Without another word, I stood and stormed out of the office, my footsteps heavy with frustration as I marched back to our room.

"Why are you mad?" Sebastian asked when he finally joined me, shutting the door behind him.

"I hate being brushed aside like I don’t matter," I growled, flopping onto the couch with a sigh.

Today had been exhausting.

###Chapter 0121

"What would you like for dinner?" Sebastian asked as he headed toward the bathroom.

"Maybe a wrap or a sandwich. Whatever they have is fine—I'm not picky."

"Got it." His voice echoed from the bathroom before the shower turned on. The door was slightly ajar, and for a moment, I debated joining him. Instead, I stepped out onto the balcony and sank into one of the plush lounge chairs. The evening air was warm, but I quickly grew restless.

"Sebastian, I'm just running to the library to grab a book!" I called out.

"Fine. But come straight back," he replied, his tone firm.

"Yes, sir," I teased, grinning at the small taste of freedom. The library was just down the hall, but it still felt like a tiny escape.

The moment I stepped inside, the familiar scent of aged paper and ink wrapped around me. I selected a book at random and hurried back to the bedroom. Sebastian was still in the shower, so I settled back onto the balcony and cracked open the book.

"What are you reading?" His voice startled me as he dropped into the chair beside me, clad only in low-slung shorts.

"A Brief History of Time," I answered. "Stephen Hawking. Call it a weird fascination."

"Space or the mechanics of the universe?" His question surprised me.

"You've read it?"

"Yeah. I like how everything connects."

"Same. It’s wild to think we’re just specks in something so vast." I leaned back, watching as the sun dipped below the treeline.

A soft knock interrupted us. Sebastian got up and returned with a cart of food. "Dinner is served," he announced, placing a plate beside me.

"Thanks."

"Mm-hmm."

We ate in comfortable silence, watching as the last streaks of sunlight faded and stars began to dot the sky. The warm breeze played with my hair, and I sighed.

"I'm going to shower real quick. Wash off the day."

"Sure." Sebastian poured himself a glass of scotch as I slipped into the bathroom.

The water was heavenly against my skin, though it stung where I’d been bitten earlier—still irritated that it had even happened. But the feeling of clean hair was worth it. After drying off, I pulled on silk pajama shorts and a matching tank before rejoining Sebastian on the balcony with my own drink.

"Better?" he asked.

"Much." The scotch burned pleasantly as it went down.

"I left whiskey out here for you."

"Thanks. Though this stuff is still disgusting." I downed the rest and went back inside, rummaging through the cabinets until I found the good stuff—Jack Daniel’s Gentleman. Pouring myself a generous glass, I returned to the balcony. "Now that’s better."

"What color’s your prom dress?" Sebastian asked suddenly.

"Black."

"Good."

"Good?"

"Means I don’t have to buy anything new to match you," he said, taking a sip.

"Lucky you," I deadpanned.

"School’s almost over," he mused, staring into his glass. I waited for him to continue. When I didn’t respond, he added, "With everything going on, maybe we should just have our finals sent to us and be done with it."

I didn’t answer. Instead, I tilted my head back, imagining myself on a beach somewhere—tiny silver bikini, drink in hand, warm sand between my toes, salt-kissed wind in my hair.

Sebastian stood abruptly and disappeared into the bedroom. I heard rustling but didn’t look until he called my name.

"Evelyn?"

His fingers were magic—gentle yet commanding. A moan escaped me before I could stop it. He worked his way up my other leg, pushing it open slightly wider than before. Confused, I didn’t react until his hand brushed higher, teasing before retreating.

The sheet slipped between my legs, covering only the most sensitive part of me as his fingers traced my inner thighs. Heat pooled low in my stomach, but I was too lost in the moment to notice the table tremble.

Only when the sheet slid away completely and something warm and wet pressed against me did my hips jerk forward, a deep moan tearing from my lips. Sebastian’s arms hooked under my legs, his hands sliding up to grip my waist.

His tongue was relentless, his hands roaming—kneading my stomach, gripping my hips. My breath came in ragged gasps as he pulled away, leaving me trembling.

###Chapter 0122

The massage table stood in the center of the room, draped in crisp white linen. Sebastian smoothed the sheet with practiced hands before glancing up at me.

"Come here," he said, his voice low and commanding.

Curiosity piqued, I rose from my seat and approached.

"Yes, Alpha?"

"Undress and lie down. I'll get the oil."

Sebastian disappeared into the adjoining room, and I didn't hesitate. Setting my glass aside, I shed my clothes and settled beneath the sheet just as he returned. My hair spilled over the face cradle as the soothing sound of ocean waves filled the air. The soft pop of the oil bottle opening sent a shiver down my spine.

He adjusted the sheet just above the curve of my backside, then began at my neck. His fingers pressed firmly, fanning outward as they glided down my spine. The oil made every movement effortless, his touch both deliberate and intoxicating. His hands were artists, sculpting tension from my muscles with each stroke.

Sebastian lifted my arm, settling onto the table beside me. He draped my wrist over his knee, one hand cradling the back of my head while the other worked my shoulder. My eyes fluttered shut, rolling back as pleasure coiled through me. He avoided my injuries, skirting each bruise with precision before moving to my legs.

The sheet slid away, exposing one leg—and the curve of my backside. Starting at my knee, he kneaded upward, his grip firm and unrelenting. Again and again, his fingers worked the tightness from my muscles. When they brushed my inner thigh, I bit my lip to stifle a moan. He lifted my foot, massaging every inch from my calf to my toes, leaving no muscle untouched. After the day's exertion, his touch was pure bliss.

Then he shifted, pressing his elbow into the curve of my backside as he rotated my leg. The new angle wrenched a gasp from me. He arched my leg to the side, his fingers teasing dangerously close to where I ached for him. By the time he moved to my scalp, tugging lightly at my hair, I was trembling.

"Turn over," he murmured, lifting the sheet.

I obeyed, flipping onto my back. He draped a towel over my chest before removing the sheet entirely, leaving one leg exposed while the fabric shielded my core. His hands traced my thigh, circling inward toward my stomach before gliding up to my shoulder. The pressure was perfect, following the natural lines of my body.

He took my arm, his fingers trailing down my side, skimming the swell of my breast before working down to my fingertips. Every touch was deliberate, leaving no patch of skin untouched. When he moved to my legs again, his grip was firm, rotating my foot to ease every last knot.

Then—without warning—he spread my legs wider.

Confusion flickered through me. He hadn’t done this before. His hands slid up my inner thighs, grazing the edge of my core before retreating. The sheet shifted, barely covering me as his fingers traced teasing circles along my sensitive skin. Heat pooled low in my belly, my breath hitching.

I was so lost in the sensation that I barely noticed the table tremble.

Until the sheet slipped away completely.

Something warm and wet pressed against me, and my hips jerked instinctively. A moan tore from my lips, raw and unfiltered. Sebastian’s arms slid beneath my thighs, lifting me as he ripped the towel aside. His hands claimed my breasts, squeezing as his tongue worked magic between my legs.

I arched into him, gasping as his fingers trailed down my stomach, teasing my hips. My breaths came in ragged bursts, my body alight with need—

Then he was gone, slipping off the table with a smirk.

###Chapter 0123

"Turn around," Sebastian commanded, his voice thick with desire.

My body responded instantly, as if under some primal spell. Anticipation coiled tight in my stomach, making my breath come in short gasps. His hands found my thighs again, already parted for him. Sebastian stepped back momentarily, and I heard the distinct sound of something being switched on—a low, steady vibration that sent shivers down my spine.

Before I could question it, he pressed the vibrator inside me.

"Holy hell," I moaned, arching off the table as the sensation rippled through me. His fingers returned, teasing, then slipping inside with practiced ease. "Oh, Sebastian!" His name spilled from my lips like a prayer.

He worked me slowly, coaxing my body to relax before adding a second finger. Meanwhile, his other hand guided the vibrator in and out, the relentless rhythm making me slick against the polished wood beneath me.

Just as I was teetering on the edge, he stopped—but left the vibrator humming inside me. He lifted one of my legs, then the other, tilting my hips upward. The shift in position left me exposed, vulnerable.

Then came three fingers, stretching me further. The table creaked under his weight as he climbed onto it. The pressure built, the vibrator pushing me closer to the brink. A soft pop sounded as his fingers withdrew, replaced by the blunt pressure of his cock against my entrance.

I gasped when he pushed inside, the stretch overwhelming. He gave me a moment, letting me adjust before reaching around to toy with the vibrator, distracting me from the burn. When my muscles relaxed, he began to move.

"Oh, SEBASTIAN!" I cried as he fisted my hair, his thrusts growing harder, deeper. "Fuck!"

"Say my name," he growled, slamming into me with enough force to make the table shudder.

"YES! Yes, yes, yes!" My climax hit like a storm, tearing a ragged moan from my throat. Sebastian followed, riding out his own release before finally pulling out.

"Turn over."

I flipped onto my back just in time to see him wipe himself clean before yanking the vibrator free and plunging back into me. His body covered mine, his mouth claiming mine in a searing kiss as my legs locked around him.

The pressure built again, relentless. Just as I was about to shatter, he broke the kiss. "Look to your right," he ordered gruffly.

I obeyed—and my orgasm crashed over me the second my gaze landed on the open balcony doors. Stars exploded behind my eyelids as pleasure consumed me. Then, darkness.

Birdsong woke me the next morning. Surprisingly, my legs didn’t ache as much as I’d expected. Stretching, the memories of last night flooded back, and I bolted upright.

Sebastian stirred beside me, blinking sleepily. "Morning," he murmured, his voice rough.

"Last night…" My eyes darted to the now-closed balcony doors.

"Hmm?" His arm snaked around my waist, tugging me back down.

"The entire pack might have heard us!" My face burned as I collapsed against the pillows.

"Probably." His smirk was infuriating. "I am that good." His lips found my neck, trailing slow, possessive kisses.

"What if your father heard? I can’t show my face outside this room."

"No one will mention it," he said dismissively, rolling out of bed.

"Oh, right. Did you mind-link the whole pack and order them to stay quiet? ‘Hey everyone, if you didn’t hear me wrecking your Luna last night, keep it to yourselves!’ Yeah, that wouldn’t be obvious at all."

Sebastian shot me a wicked grin over his shoulder. "Exactly."

###Chapter 0124

"Get moving, you've got a meeting with Mom in an hour." Sebastian rolled his eyes as he strode toward the bathroom.

I bolted upright in bed, scrambling after him. "A meeting? With your mother?" This had to be a joke.

Sebastian turned on the shower, his bare chest doing nothing to distract me from the panic rising in my throat. "Yes, my mother." He stepped under the water, leaving the glass door slightly ajar for me to join.

"About what?" I demanded, poking only my head inside, my mind racing.

"Evelyn, you're covered in massage oil and still smell like sex. Do you really want to meet my mom like this?"

"It's weird when you call me Evelyn," I grumbled, stepping under the warm spray. Sebastian shifted to give me space as I began scrubbing the oils away.

"What should I call you then? I don't have permission to use 'Scarlett.' 'Eve' sounds wrong. Besides, Evelyn is your name."

I liked when he called me "love," but I wasn't about to admit that. "Call me whatever makes your heart happy," I muttered. "Now tell me what this meeting is about."

"Your Luna ceremony." Sebastian lathered shampoo into his hair as he spoke.

I froze, blinking several times before the words fully registered. Grabbing the body wash, I mechanically began cleaning myself. A Luna ceremony? I suppose I knew it was coming eventually. "Oh."

"It's more of a commitment ritual. You'll formally sever ties with your father's pack and become part of ours. When I become Alpha, we'll have a joint ceremony."

My throat tightened. The thought sent equal waves of nervousness and excitement through me. I'd officially be free of Margaret. With everything happening, I'd completely forgotten about renouncing my father's pack. Part of me already felt detached from them anyway.

Sebastian cupped my chin, tilting my face up to meet his gaze. "Is that okay with you?"

"Y-yeah. I forgot about that part. After we mated, I stopped feeling like I belonged there, so it wasn't really on my mind."

He leaned down, brushing his lips softly against mine. "You belong here now." His forehead rested against mine as he spoke.

"Yeah, you're stuck with me." I gave him one last kiss before he straightened, allowing me to finish showering.

"What else is on the agenda today?" I asked as I toweled off.

"Figured you'd want to check on your shop." Sebastian sighed.

"I do, but what about the rogues? I want to be there for the interrogation."

Sebastian didn't respond immediately, shutting off the water and stepping out. "Why?"

"If it concerns me, I have every right to know. Plus, I'll cooperate better if I understand the full situation." I tried reasoning with him.

"Tell you what—Grayson will be at the shop. If he agrees, you can go." He wrapped the towel around his hips and left the bathroom.

Damn it. Grayson never wanted me near the holding cells. Standing before the mirror, towel wrapped around me, I began brushing my hair, strategizing how to convince my stubborn brother.

After applying light makeup and meticulously blow-drying my hair straight, I slipped into a sundress. Sebastian was texting when I emerged.

"Almost ready?" he asked without looking up.

"Just need to get dressed. Who are you texting?" It wasn't jealousy prickling at me, but fear he'd contact Grayson first and ruin my chances of pleading my case.

###Chapter 0125

Sebastian stepped into the closet just as I fastened my bra. "Your wounds are healing well."

My gaze dropped to them. They looked days old, as if they had never been fresh injuries. The pain was completely gone. "Don't change the subject."

I shot him a glare. Grabbing a lightweight romper, I slipped into sandals and buckled them quickly.

"Grayson texted, asking when you'd arrive."

"Did you tell him about the rogues?"

"No, I didn't." He even held out his phone so I could read the messages myself. Stepping closer, I scanned each one—not a single mention of the rogues.

"Good." I exhaled, satisfied.

"Can we go now?" Sebastian asked.

"Yeah."

I think I surprised him when I slid my hand into his. Physical affection wasn’t usually my thing. The way his expression shifted—first shock, then warmth—sent a ripple of satisfaction through me. Sebastian tightened his grip as he shut the bedroom door behind us.

To my surprise, he led me straight to the library instead of the front door.

"I thought we were meeting your mother?"

"We are." He released my hand to open the door for me.

The scent of fresh sandwiches, ripe fruit, and blooming flowers hit me instantly. Luna Amelia had transformed the library into an elegant brunch setting, complete with floral arrangements and a spread of food.

"Ah! Perfect timing!" She rushed forward and pulled me into a hug.

I stiffened for a second before awkwardly returning it. Until now, our interactions had been minimal—polite, but distant.

"What’s all this?" I asked, unable to hide my smile.

"Well, we have a ceremony to plan! I thought we could enjoy brunch while getting to know each other better." She gestured around the room, her expression hopeful.

For a moment, I was speechless. I’d never had a mother figure who cared enough to do something like this. My eyes traced the delicate table settings—bowls of fresh fruit, crisp salads, trays of assorted finger foods. There was even a separate table just for desserts.

When Sebastian’s hand settled on the small of my back, the electric jolt snapped me out of my daze.

BONUS

"What else is on the agenda today?" I asked, towel-drying my hair.

"I figured you’d want to check on your shop." Sebastian sighed.

"I do. But what about the rogues? I want to be there when you interrogate them."

He didn’t answer, shutting off the shower and stepping out. "Why?"

"If this involves me, I have a right to know. And I’ll cooperate better if I’m fully informed." I tried to reason with him.

"Fine. Grayson will be at the shop. If he agrees, you can come." He wrapped the towel around his hips and walked out.

Damn it. Grayson had never wanted me anywhere near the cells before.

Standing in front of the mirror, still wrapped in my towel, I started brushing my hair, brainstorming ways to convince him.

After applying light makeup and blow-drying my hair, I straightened it and slipped into a sundress. Sebastian was typing on his phone when I emerged.

"Almost ready?" he asked without looking up.

"Yeah. Just need to finish getting dressed. Who are you texting?"

It wasn’t jealousy prickling at me—just the fear that he’d talk to Grayson first and ruin my chances of pleading my case.

###Chapter 0126

"Is that the one you like?" Amelia's melodic voice drifted to my ears as she leaned closer.

"My wolf, Luna. She's silver while Sebastian's is black. It feels...right." I felt Sebastian rise and move behind me, his presence warm against my back.

"You've made a perfect choice." His fingers traced lazy patterns along my spine, sending electric currents through my body. When I met his gaze, I knew he sensed my hesitation.

"I'm thrilled about this! I just purchased fresh white linens and have been dying to use them!" Amelia snatched the photo and settled onto the couch, pulling out a massive binder overflowing with fabric swatches. Sebastian guided me back to sit beside her.

"I've brought various centerpiece and decoration designs. Sebastian mentioned how you've planned all the school events. You clearly have an eye for this. We can mix and match—whatever your heart desires." Her fingers danced across the pages, each turn revealing new textures and hues.

My biggest pet peeve with events? Overdone centerpieces. Most are so extravagant they become barriers between guests. And honestly? No one remembers them afterward.

"Just simple Baby's Breath vines with black candlesticks at each table's center."

"Brilliant! Now, fabrics?"

"Satin's not my style. I prefer matte finishes."

"Actually..." Amelia flipped to a shimmering black runner with silver threading. "This has some sparkle to it."

"A touch of glitter could work, but it might clash with the Baby's Breath."

"Good point. Shall I reserve this for the accent tables then?"

"Perfect." I nodded in approval.

"Marvelous! Any other requests?"

"Could we make it an evening affair? String the tent with solar lights that illuminate at dusk."

"Absolutely!" She produced tent layouts with optional walls, along with dance floor configurations that could transform into a raised stage.

"These all look wonderful." There were only so many ways to arrange a dance floor, after all.

"We can order different styles if none suit you."

"Oh no, please use what you have. No need for unnecessary expenses."

"These are our existing signage options. Again, we can customize if none appeal."

Nothing quite matched my vision. "What if we used black-painted wood planks? I've taken calligraphy—I could hand-letter each sign."

"Now that's creative!" Amelia beamed. "I'd also suggest a plated dinner rather than buffet. My culinary creations always receive rave reviews."

That drew a genuine smile from me. "Naturally."

"Now, over here..." Amelia stood, gesturing to menu displays. "For appetizers, I've prepared three options. First: smoked salmon and herbed goat cheese crostini. Second: chipotle-glazed meatballs with avocado slices in puff pastry. Third: crispy wild mushroom caps with truffle oil."

Each looked exquisite. While I'm adventurous with food, I'd never order these from a menu description. The portions were ideal—substantial enough to savor, yet petite for sampling multiples.

I picked up the salmon crostini without hesitation. Sebastian mirrored me. "Never tried these?" I asked around a bite. He shook his head. The flavors exploded—smoky salmon, sweet goat cheese, and crusty bread creating perfect harmony.

###Chapter 0127

I picked up a meatball, admiring its perfect presentation though the avocado garnish wasn't to my taste. After removing it, I popped the morsel into my mouth. Spicy yet succulent flavors exploded on my tongue, complemented by the flaky puff pastry. Sebastian devoured his portion whole, chewing thoughtfully with an approving nod.

"Not an avocado fan?" Amelia inquired.

"Not particularly, but these are divine." Setting aside the discarded garnish, I reached for a stuffed mushroom. The first bite surprised me - instead of mushy filling, crispy breadcrumbs mingled with sweet jelly, while the mushroom itself boasted a caramelized brown sugar glaze.

Amelia watched us expectantly. "Well?"

"They're all incredible, Mom." Sebastian spoke around another mouthful. My fingers twisted nervously in my lap. "What's troubling you?" His brow furrowed when I hesitated. "We can prepare something else if none appeal to you."

Amelia's expression turned anxious.

"Oh no! That's not it at all," I rushed to explain. "Everything's perfect, I just..."

"Evelyn, what do you want?" Sebastian prompted after my prolonged silence.

"I want them all." Snatching the rectangular tuna platter, I arranged single portions of each appetizer with military precision. "We could make smaller meatballs and slice the tuna thinner to stretch portions further."

The kitchen fell silent. When I dared glance up, both wore identical stunned expressions. "That never occurred to me," Amelia breathed.

"If it's too much trouble-" I began.

"Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant!" Amelia clapped her hands, her smile radiant. "This might be our most innovative menu yet!" She herded us toward the next tasting station where three silver-domed platters awaited.

The aromas alone made my mouth water. Lifting the covers revealed culinary masterpieces: duck confit atop creamy mash, eggplant stuffed with black bean sauce, artfully arranged sushi, herb-crusted lamb with cauliflower purée, and golden beef Wellington.

Sebastian prepared tasting portions. Each bite surpassed the last in perfection. "Thoughts?" he asked between samples.

"The eggplant's too earthy. The duck and lamb are similar profiles." I nibbled my lower lip in consideration.

"The Wellington's perfectly medium-rare," Sebastian noted.

"True, but heavy for summer. The sushi offers a lighter alternative. Though the duck edges out the lamb slightly."

"Excellent choices," Sebastian agreed.

Amelia beamed as I savored another piece of torched salmon nigiri. "This is progressing wonderfully!"

"Everything's exceptional."

Amelia's smile warmed as we moved to the salad course. "I typically serve one salad option post-appetizers, but prepared three today. First, a deconstructed Waldorf with Granny Smith apples, walnuts, and blue cheese. Next, a summer berry salad with goat cheese and pine nuts. Lastly, a cranberry-pear combination with candied walnuts and red onions."

The Waldorf's tart apple slices glistened with honey vinaigrette. Sebastian speared a perfect bite and lifted it to my lips. The crisp apple delivered balanced sweet-tart notes, though essentially remained a dressed-up fruit plate.

"Verdict?" Sebastian asked after sampling himself.

The clatter of silverware filled our thoughtful silence as we evaluated each option. Amelia's excitement grew palpable as we neared the final decision-making phase, her culinary vision taking glorious shape through our collaborative tasting.

###Chapter 0128

"Oh, it's just an apple," I shrugged, poking at the Waldorf salad with my fork. "Still tasty though." I sampled the other two salads, letting the flavors dance on my tongue. "The Summer Salad is absolutely divine."

"I prefer the Cranberry Pear, personally, but both are excellent," Sebastian murmured between bites.

"Well, it's not your party," I teased.

Audrey laughed, jotting down 'Summer Salad' on her notepad. "Now, onto desserts!"

She gestured to the array of sweet treats. "First, we have a Chocolate Pistachio Dome—slice into it, and you'll find German chocolate mousse layered over a brownie base, all encased in chocolate ganache. Next is a Passionberry Parfait with a graham cracker crust. Then, a Lemon Tart topped with fresh raspberries. And finally, these adorable Blueberry and Lemon Cake Shooters."

Sebastian cut into the chocolate dome and lifted a bite to my lips. The rich chocolate melted instantly, drawing a soft moan from me. "This is heavenly," I mumbled, savoring the decadence.

"If you moan like that again, I won’t be responsible for what happens right here in front of her," Sebastian's voice purred in my mind through our link.

I choked mid-swallow, coughing violently. "Oh no! Are you alright?" Audrey gasped, patting my back.

(Cough! Cough!) My eyes watered as I waved her off. "Fine—just went down wrong." Ignoring Sebastian's smug grin, I moved to the Passionberry Parfait. It was creamy and indulgent, but too heavy for my taste—the kind of dessert you could only finish half of before feeling overwhelmed.

The Lemon Tart was, well, tart. Perfect for lemon lovers, with its sweet, smooth filling and crisp graham cracker crust. The raspberries added a nice contrast, but lemon desserts just weren’t my thing.

The Blueberry and Lemon Shooter, though? Perfection. Moist cake, just the right amount of frosting, and a subtle lemon note that didn’t overpower. I could easily devour two of these.

"So?" Sebastian prompted.

"The chocolate dome is to die for, and this shooter is amazing," I declared.

"The parfait is my favorite," he mumbled, already stealing another spoonful.

"Should we go with three desserts?" Audrey asked, arranging the top contenders on a fresh plate.

"Yes! That would be perfect!" My excitement bubbled up as I imagined the final menu.



Sebastian sliced us samples of each. Every bite was a revelation. "Thoughts?" he asked.

"I hated the eggplant. The duck and lamb are too similar," I mused.

"The beef is juicy," he countered.

"But it’ll be too heavy in summer. Maybe the sushi for something lighter? I think I prefer the duck, but barely."

"Agreed. Solid choices," he nodded.

"This is going so well!" Audrey beamed as I nibbled another piece of sushi.

"Everything’s incredible."

"I’m thrilled you like them." She smiled warmly before moving to the next table. "I usually serve salad after appetizers, but with just one option. Today, I’ve prepared three: a stacked Waldorf, a Summer Salad with berries, goat cheese, and pine nuts, and a Cranberry Pear with fresh onions and walnuts."

The Waldorf was elegant—crisp Granny Smith apples layered with walnuts and cheese crumbles, drizzled with vinaigrette. Sebastian fed me a bite. Sweet, tangy, but ultimately... just a fancy apple.

"Verdict?" he asked, taking his own forkful.

###Chapter 0129

"Thank you. I adore that kind of thing." I barely suppressed another moan as I took another bite. Sebastian arched a brow at me, but I quickly averted my gaze.

"What else do you enjoy doing?"

"I thrive on staying busy. A day with nothing planned feels wasted. So, I fill my time however I can. For the past few years, I've been organizing school events."

"That’s impressive!"

"Well, I plan them and handle some of the execution, but I have a team under me to delegate to. Actually, Audrey—my brother’s mate—was my personal assistant. Now I’ll need to find a replacement."

"How do you choose who to hire?" Luna Amelia seemed genuinely intrigued by my work.

"I usually hire scholars like myself—people who lack creative outlets. Some even get into trouble because they aren’t challenged or given opportunities to shine."

"You have such a compassionate heart." She finished her salad and set the bowl aside. "What changes would you like to see here?"

I froze, the last bite of dessert hovering near my lips. "Changes?" I asked before finally taking the bite.

"Yes! Have you noticed anything in our pack that you’d want to improve?"

"Oh… um… Honestly, I haven’t given it much thought. There’s still so much I haven’t explored. Though when I helped Sophia, she had a few ideas."

"She shared them with me, and we’ve already started implementing some!"

"That’s incredible!"

"We’re always open to new ideas. Growth is essential for the pack’s success. If you have suggestions, please share them. As you step into the Luna role, I’ll be here to guide you. But from what I’ve seen, you’re already excelling. You have a natural gift for comforting others, and you don’t hesitate to stand up to Benjamin!"

"Oh, was Alpha Benjamin upset?"

"Perfect! Feel free to eat whatever you’d like. Anything left will be thrown out, so help yourself. I’ll jot this down and be right back!" Luna Amelia beamed before slipping out the door.

I grabbed a plate of sushi and settled onto the couch. "Surprised you didn’t go for the chocolate," Sebastian teased, reaching for the duck.

"I’d rather not be naked when she returns," I muttered, shoving a sushi roll into my mouth.

Sebastian sat beside me, smirking. "So… did you enjoy last night?"

"I did, actually."

"What parts stood out?" He took a bite of duck.

"The massage was the best," I quipped.

"Oh, really?" His brow lifted.

"Mm-hmm. You’ve got talented fingers." I popped another roll into my mouth.

"I see," he murmured just as his mother reentered.

"All set! What are your plans for the rest of the day?" She grabbed the cranberry pear salad and sat down.

"Checking on the shop’s progress." I finished the last bite of sushi, stood, and returned the plate before snagging the chocolate dessert.

"Wonderful! I hope it’s coming along well. Did you have many clients to reschedule?"

"Quite a few. I’m usually booked weeks in advance."

"That’s fantastic. What drew you to tattooing?"

"I love drawing and designing. It was a creative way to make a living—and escape the packhouse for a while."

"I can’t believe you built such a successful business from scratch!" Luna Amelia praised.

###Chapter 0130

Sebastian's warm hand settled on the small of my back as he leaned forward. His touch instantly soothed me, though my nerves still buzzed beneath my skin. "Mom, we already talked about this."

"Talked about what?" I pulled away from Sebastian, glancing between them.

"You're going to keep tattooing. That's not up for discussion." His voice held steel. They wanted me to quit my art?

"You misunderstand, Sebastian." Amelia's gaze locked onto mine. "We don't want you to stop tattooing. Benjamin and I did discuss the shop taking too much time from your Luna duties. But we have a proposal for you both." She adjusted her position, the leather couch creaking.

"Which is?" Sebastian's restrained anger vibrated through his words.

"Given current circumstances, Benjamin isn't ready to step down as Alpha yet." Amelia's fingers twisted in her lap. "We'd planned for him to relinquish the title when you found your mate or reached thirty. You've proven yourself capable, but with the target on Evelyn's back..." She trailed off meaningfully. "We thought this would be perfect timing for a vacation. School ends soon - why not take that Italian trip after graduation? Once you're Alpha and Luna, travel becomes impossible. As for the tattoo shop..." Her eyes sparkled. "We'd love to see you expand it, hire more artists. Just ensure your Luna responsibilities come first."

"So I'm holding Sebastian back from becoming Alpha?" The words tasted like ash. Logically I understood, but the emotional sting burned.

Amelia shook her head. "The transition was never guaranteed upon mating. Even without these complications, Benjamin would've wanted to train you both for months, possibly years."

"Then why promise him the title?" My hands fisted in my lap.

"Evelyn," Amelia sighed, "you're an Alpha's daughter. Plans change daily. Didn't your father intend to wait until Grayson turned twenty-five? After Margaret's public displays, don't you think he's pushing Grayson harder now?"

I stiffened further, spine rigid. The comparison stung - my father risking his mate bond while Benjamin played it safe. Stepping down wouldn't remove the threat against me.

"Listen," Amelia softened. "This isn't the news you wanted. Evelyn, I'm thrilled you're Sebastian's mate. You'll make an extraordinary Luna. But these roles are lifelong commitments. Travel first. Learn each other's rhythms. Let Benjamin and Alexander handle Theodore. You'll still be included in all pack decisions."

The tension in Sebastian's shoulders eased slightly as his thumb traced circles on my back. Italy did sound tempting...and expanding my shop? A dream I'd never voiced aloud. Maybe this delay held unexpected gifts.

Amelia smiled knowingly as she rose. "Think about it. The world will still be there when you return."

###Chapter 0131

Shocked didn’t even begin to describe what I was feeling. I understood the words coming out of Amelia’s mouth, but they still cut deep. They were holding Sebastian back from becoming Alpha—because Dominic wanted me. My gaze dropped to her half-empty teacup, the murky brown liquid reflecting the turmoil inside me.

"What aren’t you telling us, Mom?" Sebastian’s voice was sharp, edged with frustration.

"Mind your tone," Luna Amelia snapped back, her eyes flashing. "At the end of the day, Dominic wants Evelyn. Benjamin and I are concerned he’ll challenge you for her. If you’re Alpha and Luna, that could extend to the entire pack. We don’t want him to have the opportunity to challenge for both. If he wants the Alpha title alone, that’s one thing—but if she’s Luna…"

The implication hung in the air like a slap.

"Anyone could challenge for that at any time," Sebastian countered, his voice tight. "Why isn’t Dad here for this?"

"Your father can be… aggressive," she admitted. "This wasn’t meant to upset you, but we wanted to be honest. You both deserve that much. I’m sorry we’re in this position. All I want is for you two to take over and be happy. But we still have a pack to protect. This isn’t what we wanted for either of you, but we’re trying to make the best of it. You wanted to travel—we’ll cover the costs. Just… think about it?"

Luna Amelia stood, smoothing her dress. "Your choices for the commitment ceremony will be honored. We’ll need to schedule a dress fitting soon. Let me know what you decide." With that, she left, the library door clicking shut behind her.

Sebastian immediately began pacing, hands on his hips, tension radiating off him.

"Did you know?" I asked quietly.

"No. I swear." He turned to face me, his expression raw. "They asked if you still wanted to travel, if you planned to keep tattooing. I told them I wasn’t sure about the travel plans since we hadn’t discussed it, but that you’d definitely keep working."

"I’m so sorry," he murmured, dropping to his knees in front of me. He took my hands, his eyes searching mine.

I pulled away, sliding past him to stand. The hurt that flickered through our bond was sharp, but I didn’t know how to process any of this. She wasn’t wrong—but it still felt like a betrayal. I was the reason Sebastian couldn’t become Alpha. My thoughts were a tangled mess, emotions warring inside me.

"Let’s go check on the shop," I finally said, needing an escape.

Sebastian didn’t argue. He stood, opening the door for me, his anger simmering beneath the surface. I couldn’t tell if it was directed at his parents, Dominic, or even me. He held the car door open, waiting until I was settled before shutting it gently—only to slam his own door and peel out of the driveway.

Between his stormy silence and my own churning emotions, I didn’t know what to say. Taking their offer of a getaway felt wrong, like running away. I kept my eyes fixed on the passing trees, letting the blur of green numb my mind. Leaning back, I forced myself to shut down, refusing to think or feel. Instead, I focused on the shop—on the future I could control.

The street was packed when we arrived, forcing Sebastian to park farther down. The moment the car stopped, I was out, the wind carrying the scent of sawdust—proof of progress. Sebastian joined me but kept his distance, not reaching for me.

The tension between us was thick, unspoken words hanging heavy in the air.

###Chapter 0132

I took a deep breath and nodded, forcing myself to walk toward my shop. Just as we approached, Grayson and Audrey stepped out. "I was wondering when you two would show up," Grayson said, extending his hand to shake Sebastian’s.

Ignoring them, I peeked inside the shop. It looked incredible.

"Scarlett?" Grayson placed his hand on my shoulder.

"What?" I snapped, turning to face him. His eyes narrowed.

"Something’s wrong," he said, studying me like he could see straight through me. It was irritating.

"Nothing," I muttered, shrugging his hand off and stepping inside.

"I don’t think so." Grayson grabbed my arm and pulled me back—not hard, but enough to stop me.

"What’s going on?"

For some reason, I didn’t feel like explaining what had just happened with Sebastian. "Sebastian doesn’t think I should be at the rogue interrogation. I told him I want to be there." It wasn’t a complete lie, but it wasn’t the full truth either. The whole thing had me fuming.

Grayson released me but kept his gaze locked on mine. "Why do you want to be there?"

"Because I deserve to know why they’re after me! If this whole damn mess is about me, I have every right to hear it from them myself!" My anger flared, feeding off the frustration still simmering beneath my skin.

"Calm down. We can talk about this without losing our heads," Grayson said, holding up his hands after I practically snarled at him.

I rolled my eyes and stormed inside the shop.

The floors were finished, and the walls had fans blowing to dry the fresh paint. Workers were assembling my desk and chairs. The sight lifted my mood slightly—at this rate, I could place an order and start tattooing soon. The deep emerald green I’d chosen was perfect, exactly the vibe I wanted. This place felt like me.

The only odd detail was the extra chairs. There were three tattoo stations now, separated by a low half-wall.

"What do you think?" Audrey’s voice pulled me from my thoughts. I turned to see her walking toward me while the guys watched from the doorway.

"It looks amazing. I should probably place an order soon."

"Already done!" Audrey grinned. "It should arrive by Wednesday. Maybe even sooner." She frowned slightly, trying to recall the exact delivery date.

"You’re a lifesaver," I said, forcing a smile.

"Are you okay? You seem off. Don’t you like something?" She glanced around, suddenly uncertain.

"No, it’s not that at all. You’ve done an incredible job."

"You sure?" She narrowed her eyes, pressing the issue.

"I’m fine, thanks," I said, trying to keep the edge out of my voice. She must have caught it because she retreated to Grayson, who wrapped an arm around her.

All three of them were staring at me. I turned my back, but the mirror betrayed me—their gazes burned into my reflection.

I was reaching my breaking point. I wasn’t some damn puppet for them to control. No, I was going home, changing into workout gear, and taking my frustration out on a punching bag. And if someone got in my way? Well, I wouldn’t hesitate to break a jaw. I didn’t care what Grayson or Sebastian thought.

Spinning on my heel, I held my head high as I marched toward them. I saw Grayson mouth oh, for fuck’s sake before shaking his head. Sebastian shot him a confused glance.

"We’re leaving," I said firmly to Sebastian as I strode past him. I didn’t stop until my hand was on the car door.

"Scarlett, can we talk about this?" Grayson called after me.

"I’m done talking," I snapped, yanking the door open and sliding inside. Sebastian wasn’t far behind, thankfully, so I didn’t have to wait long before he got in and started the engine.

He drove back to the packhouse at an annoyingly slow pace, as if trying to prolong the tension.

###Chapter 0133

The entire car ride was spent with my arms tightly crossed. Sebastian didn't attempt to touch me or even speak. Part of me was annoyed by his silence, but the larger part just wanted to be left alone. His phone buzzed several times, and though curiosity gnawed at me, my stubborn refusal to engage with him won out.

The moment the car rolled to a stop in front of the packhouse, I flung the door open before it fully halted. "Damn it, Evelyn," Sebastian muttered under his breath as I stormed inside, my legs carrying me faster than I thought possible.

"Evelyn!" My father's voice boomed through the foyer, startling me so badly I nearly tripped over my own feet.

"D-Dad?" I blinked, taking in the scene. Luna Amelia, Alpha Benjamin, and Luna Margaret stood in the center of the foyer, deep in conversation. Pack members milled about, though none dared interrupt the alphas.

"Have you forgotten your manners entirely? I swear, I didn't raise you to—" Margaret began her usual tirade. But today, my patience had evaporated. Before I could think, my fist shot out, connecting squarely with her jaw. She crumpled to the ground, unconscious.

Instant regret flooded me, but I wasn't sticking around for the fallout. Ignoring my father's shocked expression and the gasps echoing around me, I pushed past everyone and bolted up the stairs. My vision blurred with unshed tears, rage boiling beneath my skin.

Fumbling with the lock, I finally managed to wrench the bedroom door open. I slammed it shut behind me—or at least, I tried to. A hand caught it at the last second. Sebastian slipped inside before I could protest.

Hands on my hips, I braced for the yelling. Instead, he strode to the bar, poured two glasses of whiskey, and grabbed the bottle. Setting everything on the coffee table, he sank onto the couch, one arm draped over the back, legs crossed. He took a slow sip, watching me with an unreadable expression. After a long moment, he leaned forward and pushed the second glass toward me.

I was too stunned to move. Where was the shouting? The punishment? All he offered was a drink.

Maybe this was the calm before the storm. Cautiously, I approached, downed the whiskey in one go, and set the glass down with a sharp clink. Sebastian refilled it without a word.

I knocked that one back too, then finally broke the silence. "Aren’t you going to yell at me?"

"I don’t plan to," he replied, his voice eerily calm.

"Why not?" This time, I poured my own drink.

"Nothing to yell about." He shrugged, settling deeper into the couch.

I didn’t know how to react. Should I sit? Keep standing? After an awkward shuffle, I perched on the far end of the couch, putting as much distance between us as possible. "How can you just sit there?"

"You can literally feel my every emotion," I snapped, more bitterly than intended.

"True. But I’d rather hear it from you." His gaze never wavered.

"Oh, so now you’re Dr. Phil?" Sarcasm dripped from my words.

"Don’t." His eyes darkened, a warning flashing in them. He hated when I used sarcasm against him, but right now, I couldn’t care less about his feelings.

"What the hell do you want me to say?" My anger flared again. I shot to my feet, pacing as words tumbled out unchecked.


###Chapter 0134
My Mate

"I have a fucking psychopath after me, possibly sending rogues to kidnap me. But no, my pack thinks I shouldn’t worry about it or be involved in questioning because I’m a girl. My future mother-in-law doesn’t want me to be Luna yet, or let her son become Alpha—all because they’re terrified Sebastian will lose the challenge to Dominic. So everything’s at a standstill just because I exist. And then, I thought I’d finally escaped Margaret by mating with you, that I was safe here from her venomous words—only to find out that was a fucking lie. So yeah, I snapped, okay? I can’t take it anymore. I’m not some fragile doll that needs coddling. I’ve been trained as a warrior my whole damn life. I’ve seen just as much bloodshed as you have! Just because I have a vagina doesn’t mean I don’t deserve the same respect!"

Before I could stop myself, I hurled the glass against the wall with all my strength. It shattered into a thousand glittering shards, mirroring the fractured state of my heart.

Sebastian leaned forward, sliding his untouched drink toward me before reclining again. I stared at it, confusion cutting through my rage. "W-what?"

"Drink." His voice was calm, steady.

"I don’t want another drink." My anger was already ebbing, soothed by his composure—and the half-bottle of whiskey I’d just downed.

"No one’s mad at you." He rested his chin on his hand, watching me with those piercing eyes.

"Why not?" I’d punched a Luna in the face. I should be in chains right now.

"Couple reasons." He stood, closing the distance between us. His hands settled on my shoulders, sliding down my arms in a slow, grounding motion. "First, you don’t belong to that pack, and she disrespected you. You had every right to handle it however you saw fit. Second? She had it coming. Honestly, I’m surprised you didn’t do it sooner." His thumbs brushed my wrists. "I’m proud of you, Evelyn. You finally put her in her place. If you want, we can ban her from ever setting foot here again."

"But your dad… Luna Amelia…" My brain was still struggling to catch up.

"Amelia thinks she deserved it. And your dad wasn’t even that upset." He tipped my chin up, forcing me to meet his gaze. "It’s okay."

I opened my mouth, then closed it as Sebastian stroked my cheek, flooding me with calm through our bond. "I still want to be there when they interrogate the rogues," I muttered stubbornly.

"Okay."

"Just like that?" I searched his face for the catch.

"Like you said—if you didn’t have a vagina, no one would’ve questioned you being there. Don’t blame me for wanting to protect my girl. I forget sometimes that you’re just as lethal as the rest of us."

"Good." I didn’t know what else to say.

"After that, want to ride up to the construction site? Check on the event center?" There was a hopeful edge to his voice.

A bike ride. Yes. "I guess that’s fine." I tried to sound indifferent, but Sebastian saw right through me. His lips twitched as he pulled me into a hug, his chest vibrating with silent laughter. The more amused he got, the more the tension bled from my shoulders.

When he finally released me, he kept hold of my hand as we left our room and headed for Alpha Benjamin’s office. A flicker of embarrassment pricked at me, but mostly? I felt smug. That bitch earned what she got.

Sebastian knocked twice before pushing the door open. Inside, Dad and Alpha Benjamin were deep in conversation. Margaret sat in a chair, an ice pack pressed to her jaw, while Luna Amelia stood behind her mate.

"Come here, kid." Dad opened his arms, and I crossed the room faster than I meant to. Nothing in the world compared to the safety of a parent’s embrace.

###Chapter 0135

"Don't you dare touch that woman!" Margaret shrieked, glaring at me with one swollen eye.

"Keep talking, and I'll make sure the other one matches. This is my pack, and you will show me respect." My grip tightened around my father's waist. "One more word, and you'll be banned from these grounds."

"You wouldn't banish your own father!" Margaret gasped, her face paling.

"No, I wouldn't. But I will banish you." This time, I released my father and turned fully toward her. My voice was ice. "Try me."

"Alpha Benjamin!" Margaret whirled toward Alpha Benjamin and Luna Amelia, desperation in her voice. "Are you going to let her speak to me like this?"

"Actually, yes." Alpha Benjamin's tone was firm. "From the moment we met Evelyn, we've witnessed the abuse she's endured at your hands—verbal, emotional, even physical. That ends now. She's no longer under your authority. She's ours to protect. And if she says you're banned, then you're banned. My advice? For once in your life, shut your mouth."

Margaret recoiled as if struck. She looked to my father, tears welling in her eyes.

"Go sit down," my father sighed, exhaustion lining his face. "Let us finish this meeting."

With a choked sob, Margaret stumbled to the couch, positioning herself as far from us as possible. The occasional sniffle reached my ears—her pathetic attempt to guilt us.

"Anyway," Alpha Benjamin continued, "the rogues are awake and ready for interrogation."

"I'm going," I declared.

Every head in the room snapped toward me.

"What? Why?" My father frowned.

"They were sent to kidnap me. I deserve to hear what they have to say. I'm a trained warrior—I've fought, I've killed, and I sure as hell can handle an interrogation."

"Fine. Let's go." Alpha Benjamin shrugged and stood. Luna Amelia's eyes widened, but she stayed silent. Margaret, thankfully, didn't utter a word.

"Amelia," Alpha Benjamin murmured to his mate, "keep our... guest company." He pressed a quick kiss to her cheek.

"Of course," Luna Amelia said stiffly, crossing her arms as she took a seat.

"After you." Alpha Benjamin gestured for me to lead the way. Sebastian held the door open, his expression unreadable.

We were halfway to the interrogation cells when my father spoke again.

"Are you sure about this, Evelyn?"

"Positive."

"Interrogations aren't always clean. They'll use any means necessary to get answers."

That gave me pause—but only for a second. "I can handle it."

"Just remember—there's no shame in walking away if it gets too much."

I exhaled. "Dad... I promise, if it gets bad, I'll leave. Okay?"

Some things never changed—no matter how old I got, he'd always worry.

Satisfied, he nodded.

What I didn't expect was the transformation in the men around me.

Sebastian's warm green eyes turned black—predatory, hungry for blood. The moment my father stopped speaking, his own demeanor shifted. His chest expanded, his shoulders broadened, and an aura of raw dominance pulsed around him. It was almost enough to make me step back.

Alpha Benjamin seemed to grow taller, his presence magnifying tenfold.

A guard stood at the entrance, an AK-47 gripped tightly in his hands. The wind tousled his hair, but his stance was rigid—knees bent, shoulders squared, finger hovering over the trigger.

This wasn't just an interrogation.

This was a hunt.

###Chapter 0136

The moment we stepped inside, Sebastian locked eyes with Alpha Benjamin and shifted to the side. Two sharp knocks later, the heavy metal door swung open, revealing another armed guard holding it for us. Every few feet, a stone-faced sentry stood at attention, weapons ready—just waiting for an excuse to unleash violence.

The deeper we ventured, the stronger the stench of filth, sweat, and blood became. Moans and muffled cries echoed from the cells lining the corridor. Only once did a prisoner lunge forward, fingers clawing toward me. Sebastian yanked me back just as a guard slammed his baton against the bars. The man’s laughter faded into silence as we entered the interrogation room.

The space was a grim, cracked concrete box, illuminated by a single flickering fluorescent light dangling from a frayed wire. A large one-way mirror dominated the wall opposite three naked men strapped to metal chairs. Though we stood in shadow, their nostrils flared—they could smell me.

"I thought there were more," I mind-linked Sebastian.

"There were." His grim tone told me everything—the others hadn’t survived.

Nathan and Alpha Benjamin stepped into the harsh light while Sebastian remained beside me, his arms crossed, barely containing his fury.

"Let’s skip the pleasantries," Nathan growled. "Who sent you to attack my pack?"

Something glinted in the light—brass knuckles, but not the ordinary kind. These had sharp, conical spikes over each knuckle.

I recognized the tactic. Find the weakest link. Break them first.

Alpha Benjamin delivered brutal punches to each man before stepping back, waiting.

The middle prisoner subtly tucked his left foot behind his right, as if shielding it. "We don’t know nothin’!" he spat.

"Shut up, Fred!" the one on the right snarled.

"I ain’t dying for some lowlife!" Fred jerked against his restraints.

"Then start talking!" Nathan roared.

Alpha Benjamin moved to a table I hadn’t noticed before, setting down the knuckles and picking up something long and white—a cattle prod, its twin metal prongs crackling with blue electricity.

"Counteroffer," the middle man sneered. "I’ll talk—but only to her." His gaze locked onto me, as if he’d known exactly where I stood in the dark.

"Not happening." Nathan drove his fist into the man’s nose.

"It’s fine," I mind-linked him. I didn’t want to undermine his authority, but we needed answers.

"Then we got nothin’ to say!" The prisoner spat blood onto Nathan’s chest.

Stepping forward, I emerged into the light, forcing my nerves down. They couldn’t sense my fear—this had to go smoothly.

"Talk."

Their eyes raked over me before Sebastian let out a vicious growl.

"Oooh, big bad mate gonna kill us?" The right one laughed.

"You wanted me. So speak." I crossed my arms, waiting.

"Now I see why he wants you," the left one leered, licking his lips. My skin crawled, but I kept my expression cold.

Alpha Benjamin jammed the cattle prod into his ribs. The man convulsed, urine soaking the chair beneath him.

"Let’s start with you." I stopped in front of the middle prisoner, my voice icy.

His grin was all teeth. "Oh, sweetheart. You have no idea what’s coming for you."

###Chapter 0137

"Do your best!" I nodded and approached the table, scanning the items laid out. A bat rested near the edge. I picked it up and tapped Sebastian's left leg with it. Despite his efforts to hide it, he flinched.

"You can try to hide it all you want, but I know that leg is already hurt. Tell me what I want to know, or I'll make sure it's broken beyond repair before I cut it off."

His face paled. "You don't have the guts."

Calling his bluff, I grabbed a length of rope from the table. His eyes widened as I bent down to secure his leg. His right leg thrashed wildly, making it difficult to tie properly. Thankfully, my father, Alpha Benjamin, stepped in, pinning his right leg down while I secured the rope. Sebastian yanked against the restraints, but Grayson tightened his grip, pulling the rope taut.

"Last chance," I said, adjusting my stance to get the right angle for a swing.

"You're weak," he spat, though his gaze flickered nervously to his bound leg.

I swung the bat with all my strength, aiming directly for his shin. The sharp crack of bone echoed through the room, followed by his agonized scream. The other two rogues winced and looked away, but I didn't stop. Two more brutal swings, and I finally stepped back, breathing hard.

"Still think I'm weak?" I asked, waiting for his sobs to subside.

He glared up at me, tears streaking his face. "Fuck... you."

I swung three more times before he finally broke. "OKAY! I'LL TALK!"

"Good choice," I said, setting the bat down. My hands trembled slightly from the exertion.

"Everything was handled remotely—phone calls, encrypted messages. No face-to-face meetings. That's all we know."

"Shut up!" the rogue on the right snarled, his face twisted in fury.

Alpha Benjamin didn't hesitate. He grabbed a knife and drove it deep into the man's thigh, twisting before yanking it free. Blood sprayed, and the man gasped. "I'm bleeding out!"

"That's the point," I said flatly.

The middle rogue watched in horror as his companion's blood pooled beneath the chair. Within moments, the man's eyes rolled back, and he slumped forward, unconscious.

"Our phones—they're in an old elm tree, about a mile outside your territory. Near a stream. You'll find everything you need there!" The remaining rogue was ghostly pale.

"I'll even draw you a map!" Clarence added frantically as Grayson released his leg.

"Why me?" My voice wavered, and I hated how vulnerable I sounded.

"We don't ask questions. We get paid to do a job, and we do it. If you hadn't been right there, things might've gone differently. Stupid bastard didn't even check before climbing the wall. Now we're all paying for it." Clarence shook his head. "Just make it quick. I told you everything."

Sebastian pulled me back into the shadows as Alpha Benjamin took notes on the location of their phones. My father stood behind them, silent and waiting. The rogues kept glancing back at him, their fear palpable.

"Are you holding up okay?" Sebastian mind-linked me.

"Yeah, I'm fine." But the truth was, this was getting to me. In battle, it was kill or be killed. This? This felt cold. These men would've killed or kidnapped me if we hadn't stopped them, but watching my father wait for the right moment to end them was different.

"Actually, I need to go."

Sebastian didn't argue. He opened the door quietly, letting me step out first. The moment the door closed behind us, I quickened my pace, desperate to leave that place behind. None of the guards met my eyes as we passed.

Only when the crisp night air filled my lungs did I finally feel like I could breathe again.

###Chapter 0138

"You didn't need to follow me," I muttered, leaning against the rough bark of an oak tree.

Sebastian shrugged, his piercing gaze never leaving me. "No point staying down there with all that tension."

"I'm not fragile," I snapped, watching a pair of sparrows dart across the cloudless sky.

"I know."

"Then why are you hovering?" I turned to face him, catching the way his brows furrowed.

"Waiting for you to attack me."

"Now who's deflecting with sarcasm?"

"Learned from the best." His lips twitched in a failed attempt at a smile.

"If I can't use sarcasm, neither can you."

"Fine. Then I'm waiting for you to admit what we both know you're feeling."

"Nothing to admit. It just... felt wrong. Logically, I know they had to die. But seeing it happen—watching the life leave their eyes—it changes you."

"That's exactly why I didn't want you there."

"I never said I couldn't handle it! And I did damn well down there!" Heat flared in my chest.

"You were brilliant. Got them talking. But brilliance comes at a cost."

"I'm fine. Really. Mission accomplished. Once your father gets back with those phones, we'll have leads. We should check on the construction progress anyway."

"Alright. Let's go." As I pushed off the tree, the packhouse door swung open. Nathan and Alpha Benjamin emerged.

"We were just heading to inspect the building site," Sebastian said smoothly.

"Good plan. I'm rallying warriors to hunt down this tree." Alpha Benjamin brandished a crumpled map.

"Keep me posted," Nathan said, extending his hand.

Their handshake was firm. "Of course. The moment we find anything, you'll be the first to know."

"Dad?" My voice wavered.

"Yeah, sweetheart?"

"She's not banned, but I don't want Isabella near me again."

"Very soon..." Nathan's hands settled on my shoulders. His jaw worked silently before he sighed. "Everything's going to fall into place. Just remember—I love you. Your safety is my priority." His lips brushed my forehead before he strode away.

Confusion swirled in my gut. Alarm bells rang as I locked eyes with Sebastian. His gaze tracked Nathan's retreating form with unsettling intensity.

"Dad?" Sebastian pressed Alpha Benjamin.

"Not my story to tell, son. Focus on the construction site."

The walk to the packhouse was eerily quiet, save for the occasional birdsong. Our motorcycles gleamed in the driveway.

"I need to change," I told Sebastian. He nodded, holding the door open.

Inside, Isabella's lackeys scattered like roaches when we entered. Yesterday's brawl still fresh, they weren't stupid enough to test me again.

We took the stairs two at a time. Finding my riding gear proved frustrating—not in the dresser, not on the shelves.

"Looking for these?" Sebastian dangled my leather pants from a hanger.

"Why are they hung up?" I snatched them, grabbing a black tank top.

"I prefer organized gear. Staff probably mirrored my system." He laced his boots with practiced ease.

"Hmm." I tucked in my tank, then reached for my boots.

"That outfit?" Sebastian's voice dropped as he watched me. "My favorite on you."

"Wait till you see my prom dress."

"Nothing could top this." His hands found my hips, pulling me flush against him. Through the thin fabric, I felt his hardening length press into my back.

###Chapter 0139

"You prefer this over me being n*ked?" I teased, spinning around to face him. Sebastian's fingers tangled in my hair, tilting my head back with a gentle tug that sent shivers down my spine.

A low growl rumbled in his chest as his other hand pressed possessively against the small of my back, keeping me flush against him. "Nothing beats you bare, but this outfit is making it impossible to focus on the road." He leaned in, his breath warm against my skin.

"Too bad I can't give you road head on a bike," I murmured, just as his lips crashed into mine.

Sebastian pulled back just enough to mutter, "We could take the car instead," before claiming my mouth again in a kiss that left me breathless. My fingers dug into his biceps as we lost ourselves for long, heated moments before I finally broke away.

"If we keep this up, we'll miss our ride."

"So?"

"Then we won’t get to have any fun in the woods," I whispered against his ear, grinning as his lips trailed down my neck.

Sebastian’s grip tightened on my a ss, squeezing hard enough to make me gasp before he released me. "Fine. But move your a ss before I lose control."

I laughed, darting toward the door. "How did you manage last time?"

"Because you wouldn’t have let me do what I wanted to you then." His voice was rough, sending a thrill through me. "Now? You’re putty in my hands. One kiss in the right place, and you’re done for."

I nearly stumbled on the stairs, caught off guard. "I am?"

"Absolutely." He smacked my a ss as he passed me, holding the door open with a smirk.

I hurried to my bike, swinging a leg over the seat. "Prove it when we get there."

Sebastian’s eyes darkened as he pulled on his helmet. "You’ll regret challenging me."

His voice echoed in my mind through the pack link as we revved our engines and tore onto the open road.

"Guess we’ll see who’s better," I shot back, already imagining all the ways I’d make him pay for that remark.

"Evelyn, what the hell are you thinking about?" Sebastian demanded after twenty minutes of my mental teasing. He could feel every wicked thought through our bond.

"Just how much you love it when I use my tongue on your—"

"Enough," he cut in, his grip tightening on the handlebars. "Or I’ll pull over right here on the highway and take you."

I laughed, gunning the throttle as we hit a straight stretch. "Looks like I’m winning." The wind whipped past me, the roar of the engine beneath me, the freedom of the open road—it was pure exhilaration.

A wave of warmth flooded through me from Sebastian, his happiness and desire mingling with mine. I’d found my other half, though I’d never admit it out loud.

"Slow down or you’ll miss the turn," he warned.

"I want to take a cross-country trip on our bikes," I blurted. "Ride wherever we go for vacation."

Sebastian’s surprise flickered through our bond. "So… you’re taking your parents up on their offer?"

I grinned beneath my helmet, already picturing the adventure ahead.

###Chapter 0140

"I never said that," I declared, pulling off my helmet. The air buzzed with the sounds of drills and saws, the sharp scent of sawdust filling my lungs. In the distance, the skeletal frame of the building loomed against the sky.

"Oh?" Sebastian arched a brow as we began our ascent up the hill.

"I just meant we could ride our bikes whenever we travel. Honestly, I haven’t given much thought to what your mother said."

"Alright." His tone was neutral, giving nothing away.

"What do you think we should do?" I pressed.

"That’s entirely your call." Sebastian remained unyielding.

"This should be a joint decision."

"No, it shouldn’t." He stopped walking, turning to face me. "From the moment we met, you’ve done things your way. If I insisted on something, you’d immediately resist. I know you, Evelyn. You need to move at your own pace, on your own terms. That’s why I was irritated when my mother even brought it up."

We reached the metal fence surrounding the construction site. Ignoring the warning signs, Sebastian strode straight to the trailer where a generator hummed loudly. He knocked once before pushing the door open.

"Who the hell— Oh, Mr. Sebastian. I wasn’t expecting you today." A burly man emerged from behind a cluttered desk, wiping his hands on his jeans before shaking Sebastian’s.

"Maxwell, this is my wife, Evelyn."

I blinked at the term wife—human formalities didn’t recognize mate. "Hello," I offered my hand, which Maxwell shook with a barely concealed frown.

"Didn’t know you were married," he muttered, eyeing Sebastian. His suspenders strained against his belly, barely keeping his jeans in place.

"You never asked." Sebastian’s voice was cool. "I’m here to check progress. Walk me through where we stand."

"Of course." Maxwell snatched his baseball cap and led us outside. I lingered a step behind, observing. "Framing’s all done."

Blueprints lay sprawled on a makeshift table. While Sebastian and Maxwell debated structural details, I slipped over to study them. The event center was massive—according to the plans, it would house a football-sized—

"Evelyn." Sebastian’s voice cut through my thoughts. "What the hell are you thinking about?"

Twenty minutes of very inappropriate mental images had apparently leaked through our bond.

"Just how much you love it when I lick you just right, or when I’m on to—"

"Enough," he growled. "Or I’ll take you right here. On this highway." It wasn’t a threat. It was a promise.

I laughed, revving my engine. "Looks like I’m winning this." With a burst of speed, I shot past him, the wind whipping through my hair, gravel crunching beneath my tires.

Freedom.

A wave of warmth flooded our bond—Sebastian’s mix of amusement and affection. I’d found my other half. Not that I’d ever admit it.

"Slow down, or you’ll miss the turn," he finally said over the comm.

"I want to ride cross-country," I blurted. "Take our bikes everywhere we go on vacation."

"So… you’re accepting my parents’ offer?" Surprise colored his voice.

"What are we doing here?" I asked, glancing around the familiar forest path.

Sebastian grinned, his eyes sparkling with mischief. "I have a surprise for you."

We followed the same winding trail as before, the scent of pine filling the air.

I paused when we reached a clearing, the city sprawling below us like a glittering jewel. "I’ll never get tired of this view."

"You won’t have to," Sebastian said, already a few steps ahead, waiting for me to catch up.

"What do you mean?" I quickened my pace, curiosity tugging at me.

"Come see." He led me another hundred feet before stepping off the path.

My breath caught.

Nestled among the towering trees was a massive treehouse cabin, its frame sturdy and waiting for the final touches—electricity, plumbing, and finishing details. It stood proudly beside the convention center, a hidden sanctuary in the woods.

"What is this?" My voice was barely a whisper as I reached out, my fingers brushing the smooth wooden handrail that would soon lead to the front door.

Sebastian stayed back, watching my reaction. "You said you loved this place. I know it’s not the beach, but this will be our private escape. Just ours. A home away from home."

"You did this? For me?" I turned to him, still struggling to process it.

"For us," he corrected with a soft smile. "Come inside."

He guided me up the sturdy steps. The flooring was mostly in place, making it easy to navigate as we climbed higher.

"This is the living room," he said, gesturing to the open space. "Over there is the master bedroom. Two more bedrooms there, and two bathrooms. The kitchen will be right here." He walked to the center of the living area, arms spread wide.

"Two bedrooms?" I raised an eyebrow.

"For our kids," he said casually, "or if you want to invite Sophia and Oliver over."

He grabbed a folded blanket I hadn’t noticed before and carried it outside to what would become the front porch. He spread it out, and I sat beside him.

The view was breathtaking—unobstructed sky above, the city lights twinkling below, the treetops swaying like ocean waves in the breeze.

"This is perfect," I murmured.

Sebastian wasn’t looking at the view. His gaze was fixed on me. "Beautiful," he agreed softly.

Our eyes met, and emotion swelled in my chest. Tears pricked at the corners of my eyes. Before he could react, I threw my arms around him, knocking us both onto the blanket in a tangle of laughter.

Later, as we explored further, I studied the blueprints, noting the layout—bathrooms, open spaces, everything meticulously planned. But when I reached the attic and roof structure, something felt off.

"Sebastian?" I called, frowning at the design.

The workers stopped talking and turned to me. "Yeah?"

"I think there’s a problem." I pointed to the roof design. "The angles won’t support the weight of the space."

"Impossible!" Mr. Maxwell, the contractor, bristled. "We ran those calculations multiple times!"

"I don’t doubt you did," I said carefully. "But the spacing between the arches and the type of joints you’re using—this wood won’t hold under pressure. Snow, a full house—it’ll fail here and here." I indicated the weak points. "Possibly more."

"They’re holding up fine!" Mr. Maxwell gestured to the structure.

"Because there’s no sheetrock or people inside yet," I countered, frustration creeping into my voice. "You need additional support beams in these spots."

Mr. Maxwell opened his mouth to argue, but Sebastian cut in. "That’s a great idea. Make sure it’s done, Mr. Maxwell. And we’ll be checking in more often." He took my hand, leading me away.

The rest of the tour was uneventful. Electrical and plumbing hadn’t been started yet, but the rooms matched the blueprints perfectly, each joint seamless.

An hour later, we finished our inspection. Mr. Maxwell was clearly annoyed, but I ignored him, letting Sebastian handle the conversation.

As we left, Sebastian tugged me toward the forest, his grip warm and reassuring.

The surprise wasn’t over yet.

###Chapter 0141

"I need you." My thighs trembled as arousal soaked through my panties, the intoxicating scent filling the air between us. Sebastian inhaled deeply, his pupils dilating into black pools of desire as he pinned me with that predatory gaze.

"Fucking irresistible." The words were a rough murmur against my skin as he lowered his mouth to my inner thigh. His fingers traced featherlight circles just above my core, never quite giving me what I craved. "Right here," he growled before dragging his tongue along that sensitive spot.

My back arched off the bed. "Christ, Sebastian!"

His lips curved against my skin. "Think I can make you come without even touching you properly?" He moved up my body, hovering over my flushed face with dark amusement.

"If you don't fuck me right now, I swear I'll—"

"Promises, promises." That infuriating half-smirk appeared before he shifted to my side, finding another erogenous zone near my hipbone. My legs shook violently, trying to pull him closer, but the bastard still wore all his clothes.

Just as I reached for his shirt, his teeth grazed that sweet spot below my navel. White-hot pleasure shot through me, coiling tight in my core. "Sebastian! Please!" My hand slid between my thighs in desperation.

A low growl vibrated against my skin as he captured both my wrists effortlessly. With one fluid motion, his belt slid free—I barely registered the movement before the leather looped around my wrists, securing them above my head. "No cheating," he purred before descending again.

When his teeth closed over the sensitive skin near my right hip, I nearly came off the bed. "SEBASTIAN! I'm so close—"

"I know." His breath ghosted over my soaked panties before he bit down hard. The orgasm ripped through me like lightning, my body bowing off the mattress. Only then did he finally yank my underwear aside, his tongue replacing where his teeth had been.

"Holy fuck!" My vision whited out as he worked me through the aftershocks, adding two fingers that curled just right.

"Look at me." His command snapped my eyes open to find him hovering above me, his gaze burning with primal possession.

"Harder," I begged, my voice breaking.

This time he obeyed, sheathing himself in one brutal thrust. I didn't know when he'd gotten naked—didn't care. All that mattered was the punishing rhythm as he claimed me completely.

Later, with my face buried in his neck, embarrassed tears leaked out. Sebastian chuckled darkly before rolling us over, cradling my head in one arm while his thumb wiped my cheek. "I love you."

The kiss I gave him wasn't about lust—it was everything I couldn't say. When we broke apart, my thumb traced his swollen lips. "I love you too."

His response was another searing kiss as his hands rediscovered my body. "Never enough," he muttered against my throat, yanking my tank top upward. I helped him strip it off, gasping when his mouth closed over one peaked nipple.

"Your hands—"

"I know every inch of you." His teeth scraped the underside of my breast, sending shockwaves through me. "Like here..."

My vision blurred as pleasure short-circuited my brain.

"And here..." His mouth moved lower, near the crease of my thigh. When I tried to sit up, he pushed me back down with effortless strength. "Patience."

"This isn't fun," I panted as he removed my boots with frustrating slowness.

Sebastian's laugh was pure sin as he finally peeled my pants away, leaving me bare except for the belt still restraining my wrists. "Oh darling, we're just getting started."

###Chapter 0142

"That..." Sebastian was still catching his breath when his phone rang sharply. Our eyes simultaneously dropped to where it vibrated in his jeans pocket. I shifted off him as he reached for his pants, retrieving the phone while undoing the belt restraining my wrists.

"Hello?"

"Sebastian, you both need to return immediately. We've received the ballistics report on the bullet that shot Evelyn." His gaze locked onto mine as my lips parted in shock.

"Understood. We're heading back now." He ended the call.

"That was fast," I remarked, hastily gathering my scattered clothes.

"It's been a week. If they already have results, it must match an open case." He yanked his jeans up.

I tugged my tank top back on, struggling with my pants. "We already suspect Alpha Damian's pack. They're shady as hell."

"Hopefully, this gives us concrete evidence against them."

"Are we still executing the plan during prom?" I asked.

Dominic

"Yes. Everything's already in motion." Sebastian nodded as I laced up my boots. My hair was a tangled mess, but I'd fix it during the walk back.

"Ready?" He offered a hand to pull me up.

"Let's go." Without hesitation, I strode ahead, weaving through the trees while finger-combing my hair.

Only when we were securing our helmets did Sebastian speak again. "Hey, love?"

That nickname always sent a thrill through me. "What?"

"I made you come without even touching you." His smirk was infuriating.

"Oh?" Closing the distance, I fisted his shirt and yanked him down until our lips barely brushed. "Next time, it's my turn—and I fight dirty." I traced his lower lip with my tongue before turning away.

Sebastian seized my wrist, spinning me back into a bruising kiss. "You're fucking perfect," he growled against my mouth as I mounted my bike. A wicked idea formed as we revved our engines.

But earlier hadn't been enough. The belt had just enough slack for me to lock my legs around him, halting his thrusts before leveraging all my strength to flip us. The sudden movement caught him off guard, his cock still buried inside me as I used the belt for leverage, riding him ruthlessly.

"Fuck!" Sebastian's claws pierced my hips as I rolled my pelvis, building friction. Every snap of my hips wrenched pleasure from him until—

"SEBASTIAN!" I screamed as my climax shattered me. His release followed instantly, hips jerking upward. Collapsing over him, I glimpsed his clenched jaw and tensed body through half-lidded eyes. It took a full minute before he exhaled, muscles finally relaxing.

###Chapter 0143

My gaze lifted to meet Audrey's, but she stubbornly avoided my eyes. Grayson stood beside her, close but not touching. "Audrey?"

Tears shimmered in her eyes as she finally looked at me. "I swear I don’t know anything! You know I was an orphan—you literally found me in the woods!" Her voice trembled with desperation. "I don’t even know who my family is!"

"The DNA results show a parental match," Alpha Benjamin clarified coldly. "Meaning her father is the one who loaded the gun that shot you." His piercing gaze shifted to me. "How did you find her?"

"She was at the orphanage when I volunteered there. Just a troubled teenager—almost fifteen, always sneaking out, stealing..."

"I stole books!" Audrey cut in defensively. "Not drugs!"

"Advanced books, at that," I continued. "No one cared what she took, only that she took anything at all. But I noticed. So I took responsibility for her—made her work for me. When she proved herself, I started paying her. Not much, but enough for clothes and food. Eventually, Dad helped get her into a young adult housing program, out of the orphanage." The words spilled out mechanically, as if I were recounting someone else’s story.

"I don’t remember any family. I swear! Only the orphanage!" Audrey’s tears spilled over.

"We found her as a baby on the edge of our territory," Dad said, staring at the paper like it was written in another language. "No one claimed her. We ran her DNA through the system, but there were no matches—until now."

"Grayson, is she lying?" Alpha Benjamin demanded.

"No. She’s telling the truth." Grayson’s jaw clenched, his eyes lifting to the ceiling in silent agony. The conflict was written all over him—loyalty to his sister warring with his bond to his mate.

"G-Grayson?" Audrey looked shattered, but Alpha Benjamin didn’t hesitate. His dominance surged, a crushing wave of power that forced Audrey to her knees in instant submission.

"Have you lied to us?" he commanded.

"NO!"

"Are you hiding anything?"

"No! I love Evelyn—she’s the only sister I’ve ever known! I would never betray her!"

My mind-link buzzed.

"Sebastian?" I murmured, injecting a teasing lilt into my tone.

"What?"

"You know why I love riding my bike so much?"

"Why’s that?"

I glanced at him, smirking. "Because of the power between my legs." His eyes darkened as I twisted the throttle and shot forward, leaving him behind.

~

"You won’t be walking tomorrow," Sebastian promised as he caught up, his voice thick with promise. I didn’t answer, just grinned. The winding road ahead hugged the hillside, sharp curves beckoning. With effortless precision, I leaned into each turn, my bike an extension of myself. Knees skimming the pavement, we flew as one.

By the time we reached the packhouse, the air was thick with tension. Sebastian and I exchanged wary looks as we pulled off our helmets and headed straight for Alpha Benjamin’s office. He knocked once before pushing inside.

The room was packed—Dad, Grayson, Audrey, Nathan, Oliver, Sophia, and Luna Amelia stood in suffocating silence, all staring blankly at the wall.

"Where’s Cassandra?" I asked Nathan.

"Kitchen," he muttered, voice hollow.

"What’s going on?" Sebastian pulled me against him, protective.

"This." Alpha Benjamin flung a sheet of paper at Sebastian. It fluttered to the floor. He snatched it up, holding it so we could both read.

"I don’t understand."

"It confirms the bullet came from a 9mm Smith & Wesson—we knew that. But this gun is linked to a string of murders across the U.S." Sebastian’s finger tapped a line of fine print at the bottom. "And this is the problem."

My stomach dropped. "That can’t—no. I must be reading it wrong."

"It says there’s secondary DNA on the bullet," Sebastian growled, his body vibrating with fury. "A familial match to Audrey Blackwood."

###Chapter 0144

My gaze lifted to meet Audrey's, but she kept avoiding eye contact. Grayson stood beside her, maintaining a careful distance. "Audrey?"

She finally looked up, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. "I swear I don't know anything! You know I was abandoned! You literally found me in the woods!" Her voice trembled as she pleaded with me. "I don't even know who my parents are!"

"The DNA match indicates a parental connection," Alpha Benjamin clarified, his tone grave. "Meaning her father was the one who loaded the gun that shot you." He turned to my father. "How did you find her?"

"She was in the orphanage when I volunteered there," my father explained. "She was a troubled teenager—almost fifteen, constantly sneaking out, stealing..."

"I only stole books!" Audrey interjected, her voice cracking. "It wasn't like I was into drugs or anything!"

"The books she took were advanced academic texts," my father continued. "No one paid attention to what she was taking, only that she was taking them. I noticed, so I took responsibility for her. Made her work for me to earn trust. When she proved herself, I started paying her—not much, but enough for clothes and food. Eventually, I helped get her into a young adult housing program to get her out of the orphanage." The words spilled out mechanically, as if I were reciting a script.

"I don't remember any family. I swear! The orphanage is all I've ever known!" Audrey's tears spilled over, streaking down her cheeks.

"We found her as an infant on the edge of our territory," my father added, staring at the DNA report like it was some alien artifact. "No one claimed her, so we entered her DNA into the system in case of a match. There wasn't one—until now."

"Grayson, is she lying?" Alpha Benjamin demanded.

"No," Grayson answered, his voice strained. He looked up at the ceiling, jaw clenched. "She's telling the truth. You can command her if you need to."

"G-Grayson?" Audrey's face twisted in betrayal, but Alpha Benjamin didn't hesitate. His aura surged forward, wrapping around Audrey like an invisible force. She crumpled to the ground instantly, submitting under the weight of his dominance.

"Have you lied to us?" he commanded.

"No!"

"Are you hiding anything?"

"No! I love Evelyn—I would never betray the only sister I've ever had!"

Alpha Benjamin scanned the room. Everyone shook their heads before he finally withdrew his aura. Audrey slapped Grayson's hand away when he tried to help her up, curling into herself as if trying to disappear.

I ached to go to her, but something held me back. "I thought the ones who shot me were rogues?"

"They were," my father confirmed. "But we haven't traced them back to whoever ordered the hit. We assume it's connected to the rogue attack here."

"So we still don't know who killed Liam," I murmured, more to myself. "Did you find the phone?"

"We did," my father sighed. "It's still being analyzed—tracing the IP. Everything was encrypted."

"So we have nothing," I said flatly. "And now Audrey's DNA triggered a match. Whoever her family is, they'll know where she is now."

"To be fair," Nathan chimed in, "they left her at our gates. They've always known where she was."

"All we know is that the gun used to shoot you was loaded by Audrey's father," Alpha Benjamin stated.

"At least it wasn't the gun that killed Liam," I mind-linked Sebastian. I glanced up at him, but he barely acknowledged me, his expression unreadable.

"But we don’t know if the rogue who fired it was her father?" I pressed.

"No," my father admitted.

"So we could have killed him already. Where’s the body?"

"You know we burn them," he said, frowning. "There's no way to confirm if the rogue was her father or just someone who handled the gun."

I knew that. But I had hoped I was wrong. My heart ached for Audrey. Slowly, I moved toward her and knelt in front of her. "Please believe me," she whispered through her tears. "I didn’t know. I would never betray you."

###Chapter 0145

"I trust you, Audrey. But you need to understand the gravity of this situation. Don’t hold it against Grayson. This was necessary to clear your name."

She lifted her gaze to Grayson before turning back to me. "I know. I just feel so ashamed."

"Things might get tougher before they get better, but trust Grayson to guide you through it." I placed a reassuring hand on her knee, watching silent tears trail down her cheeks. Standing, I moved back to Sebastian, pressing my back against his for comfort. His fingers curled around my shoulders.

"Safe to say, we’ll be investigating her family. Blackwood was mentioned—that’s our starting point."

Alpha Benjamin sighed as he took a seat.

"Agreed. Keep us updated," my father said, signaling for his group to leave. Audrey stood, slipping her hand into Grayson’s as they walked out. Grayson gave me a stiff nod, guilt and turmoil written across his face. No words could fix that—only time.

"What’s the plan for the week?" Alpha Benjamin asked.

"Evelyn?" Sebastian looked down at me.

"I should go to school to grab my things, then we can head home. It’s safer this way, and we can take our exams there." I exhaled sharply, hating that I was being forced into this. If I’d wanted to test remotely, I would’ve skipped classes altogether.

"Smart move," Alpha Benjamin said, dismissing us with a wave. Annoying, but not worth arguing over.

As we stepped out, Oliver caught up to us.

"Any dinner plans?"

"Not that I know of…" I glanced at Sebastian for confirmation.

"Nope. Why? Got something in mind?"

"Movie night?"

"Sounds good." Sebastian looked at me, and I nodded.

"Grab some snacks from the kitchen and meet us in our room?" I suggested.

"Sure. Sophia will be thrilled."

"Perfect." I smiled as Oliver turned away. Following Sebastian, we headed to our quarters.

"Ever decide if you want to change anything in here?" Sebastian asked, pulling off his shirt.

"Like what?" I scanned the space—my belongings sat neatly on the nightstand. Sebastian had framed our birthday photo above the bed, but otherwise, it was exactly as I’d found it.

"New colors? Bedding? Paint?" He tossed out ideas. "You went with sage green for your shop—completely different from this."

"That was the vibe I wanted for the shop. Not my bedroom."

"Your old room at the other pack was pretty bare," he remarked as I stepped into the closet, pulling out my favorite silk pajamas.

"I knew I wasn’t staying there long, so I didn’t bother personalizing it," I called out, changing quickly.

"Well, now you can. What do you want to change?" Sebastian leaned against the doorframe.

"I like black and red," I shrugged.

"Come on, there’s nothing else?" He pushed, convinced I was holding back.

Stepping back into the room, I surveyed it. "I’m serious, Sebastian. The silk sheets are perfect—you’ve noticed my love for silk pajamas. We could upgrade the couch and chairs, though. They’re worn, and I prefer deeper seating. The white isn’t my favorite, but the red balances it. Maybe add a few more pictures to the walls…"

###Chapter 0146

"I'm glad you mentioned that." Sebastian snapped his fingers and disappeared into the closet. When he returned, he carried two large framed pictures. Turning them around, I recognized my old sketches—one of a wolf’s head and the other of a soaring eagle. "These were my favorites from your sketchbook. I had them framed. Thought they'd look perfect up on the wall."

My breath caught. He had chosen the perfect frames—a distressed light gray wood, thick and sturdy, highlighting every pencil stroke. I stepped closer, taking the wolf’s head in my hands. That piece had taken me weeks, back when I avoided the packhouse during the height of summer.

Glancing around, I pointed to the empty space above the dressers. "What about there?" It was the ideal spot.

"Perfect." Sebastian set them down and went to the kitchenette, returning with a hammer and nails.

He had planned this well. After helping him level them, we stepped back to admire the result.

"They fit perfectly," I murmured, slipping my hand around his arm.

"I agree. They’re stunning." A knock at the door interrupted us. Sebastian went to answer it while I settled onto the couch. Now that he mentioned it, maybe upgrading the furniture wouldn’t be a bad idea. It wasn’t uncomfortable, but it didn’t have the deep sink-in feel I loved for movie nights.

"Dinner’s here!" Sophia’s cheerful voice rang out as she walked in, balancing takeout containers.

"Oh, you got them up already!" Oliver followed her inside, his eyes immediately locking onto the artwork.

Setting the food down, Sophia glanced up and grinned. "Ah, the infamous wolf’s head."

"Why do you say it like that?" Oliver asked as he started unpacking the food.

"Because she was a nightmare to deal with while drawing it," Sophia teased, handing me my meal. "Moody for weeks because the eyes weren’t right."

"Hey! If the eyes are off, the whole piece is ruined," Sebastian defended, sitting beside me. Oliver passed him his food before taking the armchair.

"So, what movie did you pick?"

"We haven’t yet. Got distracted hanging these," I admitted before biting into my Italian sub.

"I’m in the mood for something scary!" Sophia scrunched her nose at me.



Later that night, Sebastian peeled off his shirt and turned to me. "So, have you thought about changing anything in our room?"

"Like what?" I glanced around. My belongings sat neatly on the nightstand. The only personal touch was the framed photo from my birthday above the bed. Otherwise, it was exactly as I’d found it.

"New colors? Bedding? Paint?" He tossed out suggestions. "You went with sage green for your shop—completely different from this."

"That was the vibe I wanted for the shop. Not the bedroom."

"Your old room was pretty bare," Sebastian pointed out as I slipped into the closet for my favorite silk pajamas.

I changed inside, raising my voice so he could hear me. "I knew I wasn’t staying there long, so I didn’t bother."

"Well, now you can. What do you want to change?" He leaned against the doorframe, watching me.

"I like black and red," I said with a shrug.

"Come on, there’s got to be something else," he pressed, as if I were holding back.

Stepping out, I scanned the room. "I’m serious, Sebastian. The silk sheets are perfect. And you’ve noticed my pajama preference." I smirked. "But we could upgrade the couch and chairs. They’re worn, and I prefer deeper seating. Maybe add more artwork to the walls..."

###Chapter 0147

"That's alright. I have my ways to persuade you." Oliver teased as he started the movie.

"What's going on?" I asked Sebastian through the mind-link. He didn’t respond but handed me his phone. I glanced at the screen and saw an email.

Sebastian,

I’d like to request a meeting with you tomorrow afternoon to discuss my potential advancement within the pack. Several positions are open, and I’d appreciate your guidance on which might suit me best. If 3 PM works for you, please confirm.

With all my love,
Isabella

"What did you reply?" I asked. Sebastian took his phone back, typed something quickly, and handed it to me again.

Isabella,

3 PM is acceptable. Luna Evelyn and I will both be present.

Alpha Sebastian

"Why don’t you have your own office?"

"Never really needed one," Sebastian shrugged, settling behind me on the couch. The movie began, and Oliver dimmed the lights.

"I think we should get one. I need space to manage my shop’s finances, and with all the new responsibilities I’m taking on, having a dedicated workspace would help."

"Fine, I’ll look into it," Sebastian murmured, wrapping his arm around me and pulling me close.

The movie started slow, like most horror films. Losing interest, I turned and rested my head against Sebastian’s chest. His fingers traced lazy circles on my back, lulling me into sleep.

"Wake up, sleepyhead!" A firm shake jolted me awake, but I refused to open my eyes.

"I know you’re awake," Sebastian chuckled.

"I don’t want to be awake. How did I even get here?"

"I carried you. You were dead to the world." The bed dipped as he stood.

"Why am I awake?" I groaned.

"We have school."

"Changed my mind. Let me sleep." I yanked the blankets over my head, only for them to be ripped away seconds later. Cold air hit my skin, and I bolted upright. "WHAT THE HELL?"

"Rise and shine," Sebastian smirked at my glare before disappearing into the closet.

Grumbling, I dragged myself to the shower—and locked the door out of spite. The sound of the handle rattling confirmed he’d noticed. The hot water helped wake me up, and by the time I finished my makeup and straightened my hair, I was almost human again.

"How much longer?" Sebastian called through the door.

I turned on the blow dryer and pretended not to hear. Eventually, his footsteps retreated.

Dressed in a romper and buckling my sandals, I finally emerged. "Hi," I offered a small smile.

"Talking to me again?" He set a cream cheese bagel in front of me.

"What do you mean?" I played innocent, taking a bite. "Thanks."

"Sure. We need to go—Grayson’s meeting us at 8:30, and I hate being late."

"Where’s your mom? I need a tote for mine and Sophia’s things."

After a pause, he answered. "Dad’s office. We’ll meet her at the front door—she’ll bring you one."

"Perfect!" I grabbed my purse and phone, and we headed out.

At the foyer, his mother wasn’t there yet. Sebastian checked his watch repeatedly. "Where is she?" he muttered.

"Relax, we’re not late for class. We’re just grabbing our stuff and coming back."

"I don’t like cutting it close," he sighed—just as Amelia rounded the corner.

###Chapter 0148

"Here! I found these two bags. They should work perfectly!" Amelia Blackwood approached me with a warm smile.

"These are exactly what we need. My backpack alone couldn't fit everything. Thank you so much."

"Anytime, dear. Though I do need to dash now."

"So do we." Sebastian practically herded me out the door before I could say another word.

"Bye!" I waved at his mother as he gave a curt nod and shut the door behind us. The car was already idling at the curb.

As we drove, Sebastian's grip on the steering wheel tightened until his knuckles turned white. His stormy expression would have sent most people running, but I found it irresistibly attractive. Still, I didn't press him about his mood. This tension went deeper than just being late—which we weren't. We pulled up to the school precisely at 8:30 AM. Grayson was waiting by the entrance.

"Hey, Scarlett." Grayson stepped forward as we exited the car and pulled me into a brief hug.

"How are you holding up?" I asked.

"Could be better." He sighed, draping an arm over my shoulders as we walked inside.

"Where's Audrey?" I kept my voice low.

"At home. I had to stop by the bank and take care of some things."

That puzzled me. "But that's Dad's responsibility..." We reached my locker. I spun the combination and started transferring my belongings inside.

"Not anymore." Grayson shrugged, his eyes darting around the hallway as if expecting trouble. Sebastian mirrored his vigilance, though he occasionally glanced my way.

"Why would Dad make you handle that?" I shoved a stack of books into the locker with more force than necessary.

"Don't worry about it." His tone was distant.

As I finally closed my freshly emptied locker, realization struck like a lightning bolt. "You're stepping into the Alpha role, aren't you?"

Grayson turned slowly, his eyes reflecting a pain so deep it made my chest ache. "Getting there."

"That means..." Dread pooled in my stomach as our father's words echoed in my mind, the pieces clicking into place. "He's going to abandon Margaret, isn't he?"

Grayson's jaw clenched. Sebastian continued scanning our surroundings but flicked his gaze toward me. "This isn't the place for that conversation."

"Sebastian's right. Let's grab your things and go." Grayson hoisted my bag onto his shoulder.

"We need to stop by Sophia's locker first," I muttered.

The walk there was silent. I'd known her combination for years—it took seconds to open the locker and clear it out. Tucked in the door's corner was a photograph. It showed all of us from three years ago: Grayson and I in the center, Sophia beside him, Liam next to me with Nathan completing the group. We were grinning in swimsuits during a carefree day at the lake. My eyes zeroed in on the dark bruise marring my hip—fresh from when Margaret had shoved me down the stairs the previous day.

"What's that?" Grayson asked.

"That day at the lake." I handed him the photo.

A bittersweet smile crossed his face as he studied it. Sebastian peered over his shoulder before resuming his watch. "That was a good day," Grayson murmured, returning the picture.

"It was." After closing Sophia's locker, we headed toward the office.

"I ran into Liam's father this morning," Grayson said hesitantly.

"Oh?" I wasn't sure I wanted to hear the rest.

###Chapter 0149

"They're burying the tree today." My chest ached knowing I couldn't be there, but I understood why.

"Where?"

"On the hill overlooking our territory."

"That’s perfect."

"He told me to tell you he forgives you. I expect he’ll call soon." Grayson gave me a half-smile as I froze mid-step. We stood outside the office.

"What?" Tears pricked at my eyes, but I swallowed them down.

"Well, isn’t this cozy?" A voice I never wanted to hear again yanked my attention away from Grayson. The office door swung open, and Dominic stepped out.

"Dominic." Grayson’s tone was sharp.

"I was hoping to run into you today." His gaze locked onto me. Sebastian moved closer, blocking Dominic’s path.

"We were just leaving," I said.

"Why the hurry?"

"You have class, and I’ve got a packed schedule. Excuse us." I brushed past Grayson and slipped into the office. No one followed, giving me a moment to breathe.

"Ms. Evelyn. How can I help you?" The secretary, an older woman with silver-streaked hair and glasses perched on the tip of her nose, smiled warmly.

"We need to take our exams remotely. I wanted to arrange for them to be emailed to us so we can take them tomorrow."

"That can be arranged. Who all needs them?" She pulled out a sheet of paper.

"Sebastian, Sophia, Oliver, and me. I’m not sure about my brother—I think he’s doing the same, along with Audrey and Nathan."

"Got it. I’ll send them over. Anything else?"

"That’s it. I’ve cleared out our lockers, and we’re still withdrawing for now. I’ve turned in all my extra assignments."

"Actually, they might want a proctor to supervise the exams." She glanced nervously at the principal’s door.

"If that’s necessary, it’s fine. Just let me know, and I’ll coordinate a time that works for everyone." It wasn’t a big deal.

"Thank you for understanding." She visibly relaxed.

"Of course. Have a great day." I stepped out of the office and rejoined the three men.

"Done?" Sebastian asked, his eyes never leaving Dominic.

"Yeah. Can we go now?"

"Let’s move," Grayson answered, gripping my arm a little tighter than necessary.

"I’ll be in touch." Dominic smirked at me before turning and strolling down the hall as the guys closed ranks around me.

Sebastian was furious, and Grayson wasn’t far behind. Their strides were so purposeful I nearly had to jog to keep up.

By the time we reached the cars, they’d cooled slightly. "Grayson, we need to talk," I said, giving him a pointed look.

"I know. I’ve got a few things to handle first, then I’ll swing by?" He glanced at Sebastian for confirmation.

"We’ve got a meeting at three. Otherwise, we’re free." Sebastian was forcing himself to relax.

"Alright. I’ll call when I’m ready—might be late afternoon or evening, but I’ll come by." Grayson met my eyes, making a silent promise.

"Okay." He pressed a kiss to my forehead, shook Sebastian’s hand, and headed to his car.

Sebastian held the door open for me, and we climbed in. Just as he pulled out, I spotted Dominic watching me through a window. A chill ran down my spine, but Sebastian sped away before I could dwell on it.

Needing comfort, I rested my hand on Sebastian’s thigh. The contact steadied my nerves. To my surprise, he released the wheel and laced his fingers through mine, shifting our joined hands to my lap—his palm warm against my thigh.

###Chapter 0150

"Are you alright?" I asked, tightening my grip on his arm as if my life depended on it.

Sebastian glanced at me, his expression unreadable. "I should be the one asking you that."

"If Dad actually lets Grayson take over and he abandons Margaret… he might not make it."

"I know," Sebastian murmured, his voice barely above a whisper.

"What happened while I was in the office?"

"Nothing major. He kept provoking us, hoping Grayson or I would snap. But we didn’t give him the reaction he wanted." Sebastian’s jaw clenched, his irritation still simmering.

"Need me to make it better?" I leaned closer, my lips brushing his ear.

Sebastian shot me a look, fighting back a smirk. "We’ll be home before you can finish. Besides, I doubt you’d want me driving through the gates with your head in my lap."

"Ugh, no." I flopped back into my seat, staring out the window.

"I’d rather not stay outside our territory longer than necessary. But once we’re home… that’s a different story." His fingers traced the hem of my shorts teasingly.

"Sorry, that offer’s expired." I grinned as he rolled his eyes.

We pulled up to the gates, and Sebastian rolled down the window to exchange words with the guards. Their conversation centered on patrols, but my mind drifted to Audrey. My chest ached for her. She didn’t choose the family she was born into. Yet, something gnawed at me—her father wasn’t the one who died. No, he was still out there. And I wondered if he even knew about her… or cared.

The car lurched forward, snapping me out of my thoughts. "What’s the plan for today?"

"I’ve got something to show you first. Then I need to get some work done."

"What’s Oliver up to?"

"Helping Sophia with some pack duties, I think."

"Like what?" The car rolled to a stop in front of the mansion.

"Beta Female responsibilities, mostly."

We stepped inside, and I moved toward the stairs, but Sebastian tugged me down the hallway instead.

"Just curious," I said.

"Want to join them?" He pushed open a door, revealing an unused conference room—now more of a storage space, really.

"Nah, I’d rather sketch today. I’ll just sit with you and doodle while you work."

"What do you think of this?" Sebastian asked.

"The storage room? A little dusty…"

"For our own office."

My brows shot up as I scanned the space. "Oh good, you’re back! What do you think? Will this work?" Amelia’s sudden appearance made me jump, my heart hammering.

"Jesus!" I sidestepped as she strode in.

Laughing, she rested a hand on my forearm. I stiffened—I wasn’t big on physical contact—but she didn’t seem to notice. Sebastian did, though. "Sorry, didn’t mean to startle you."

"It’s fine. This could be a great space."

"There’s another option I’ve been considering." Amelia motioned for us to follow her.

"There is?" Sebastian asked.

"Yeah. I’ve been looking at unused rooms, and there are a few we could renovate to fit your needs." She led us upstairs to a guest bedroom right off the staircase.

"This is a bedroom?" I frowned in confusion.

"I know, but since it’s so close to the stairs, it rarely gets used. Last time was, what, three years ago? It already has a bathroom, so you wouldn’t need to leave. Plenty of space for two desks and a small seating area. Maybe even a mini bar against that far wall. And the balcony’s a bonus. We could knock out the closet to make it bigger."

Sebastian crossed his arms, considering. "Not bad."

I bit my lip, already picturing the possibilities. "I like it."

Amelia beamed. "Perfect. I’ll get the renovations started."

As she walked away, Sebastian pulled me close. "Looks like we’re getting our own space."

I smirked. "About time."

His fingers tangled in mine. "Let’s make it ours."

###Chapter 0151

"I prefer this room, actually." I ran my fingers along the smooth wall. "Having our own bathroom will be convenient."

"Perfect!" Amelia clapped her hands together, her eyes sparkling. "I have a renovation team that just wrapped up another project. They can start on this today. All we need is flooring and paint. If you decide on the designs today, I'll place the order immediately. Oh, and don’t forget to pick out desks too."

Sebastian leaned against the doorframe. "I was planning to work from Dad’s office today since he’s busy."

"That works out perfectly." Amelia glanced at her watch. "Here, take my laptop. Browse through the options and order whatever you like."

"Sounds good," Sebastian said, already stepping out of the room.

We followed Amelia to the office, where Sebastian settled into his father’s chair. Amelia set her laptop on the coffee table in front of me.

"This is the company we usually order from. Just add whatever you want to the cart and check out." She straightened up and headed for the door.

I hesitated. "What’s the budget for this?"

Amelia paused, turning back with a warm smile. "Don’t worry about that. Choose whatever makes you happy. This is your space—your home. I want you to feel comfortable here."

Her words caught me off guard. The kindness in her eyes was something I wasn’t used to. My lips parted slightly as she left, and I stared at the door for a moment before looking down at the laptop.

"Still not used to her?" Sebastian’s voice pulled me from my thoughts.

I glanced at him but didn’t answer. Amelia and I had barely spoken before. The last time hadn’t exactly gone smoothly.

Grabbing the laptop, I settled it on my knees and started browsing. I had no idea what kind of office design I wanted, so I searched for inspiration—professional, sleek, modern. The options were overwhelming.

"What do you think?" I asked Sebastian.

He shrugged. "I don’t care. Just no neon colors."

"Why not?" I smirked.

"Just not my style."

I rolled my eyes and kept scrolling.

"Do you want to join them?" Sebastian suddenly opened a door, revealing an unused conference room that had been turned into storage.

"No, I’d rather sketch today. I’ll just sit with you while you work."

"What do you think of this?" he asked.

"The storage room? A little dusty..."

"For our office."

I blinked, surprised, and started examining the space more carefully.

"Oh good, you’re back!" Amelia’s voice made me jump as she appeared behind us.

"Jesus!" I stumbled to the side as she walked in, laughing.

She placed a hand on my arm, and I stiffened slightly—I wasn’t big on physical contact. Sebastian noticed, but Amelia didn’t seem to.

"Sorry, didn’t mean to scare you," she said, still smiling.

"It’s fine. This could be a great space."

"There’s one more option," Amelia said, motioning for us to follow her.

Sebastian raised an eyebrow. "There is?"

"Yes. We have a few rooms that barely get used. We could renovate one to fit your needs."

She led us upstairs to a guest bedroom right by the staircase.

"This is a bedroom?" I frowned.

"I know, but it’s hardly ever used. The last time was years ago. It already has a bathroom, so you won’t have to leave for one. There’s enough space for two desks and a small seating area. Maybe even a mini bar against that wall." She gestured to the far side. "And we can knock out the closet to make it bigger."

Sebastian crossed his arms, considering. "What do you think?"

I looked around, imagining the possibilities. "I think... this could work."

Amelia beamed. "Wonderful! Let’s get started."

###Chapter 0152

"Absolutely." Sebastian rose from his chair and settled beside me on the couch.

"Perfect. Here's my inspiration photo." I clicked over to the tab displaying the g****e aesthetic I'd chosen.

He studied it for a moment. "Interesting choice. Didn't expect you'd go for this style."

"Why not?"

"Figured you'd pick something more like your tattoo shop aesthetic."

I shook my head. "No way. I want my office to feel completely different." I flipped to the next tab showing paint swatches and rug options.

"Looks cohesive. What about the desk?"

"Keep an open mind." With a smirk, I revealed the final tab.

Sebastian's eyebrows shot up. "Seriously? That's your choice?"

"They'll need restoration work," I said confidently, tracing the image of antique desks with my finger.

"No denying that. But if we can pull it off, they'll be stunning pieces." He nodded slowly.

"Do you even like this style? I can find something more contemporary if you prefer." I offered, suddenly uncertain.

"No, I love your vision. It'll just be... challenging." His lips quirked.

"Because I don't have enough on my plate already?" I deadpanned.

Sebastian gave me that half-smile that always made my stomach flip. "Something like that."

"Jerk." I shoved him playfully.

"You forgot about flooring."

"Oh shoot! Can't we just match the existing floors?"

"Possibly." He rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "Ask my mom when she gets back."

"Okay, be honest - did I go over budget?"

"You barely scratched the surface." Sebastian returned to his desk and resumed working. I hit purchase, and the confirmation screen promised Wednesday delivery - apparently my membership qualified for express shipping.

"I'll start with these pieces, then we can finalize decor details once everything's in place."

"Mmm-hmm." He was only half-listening, engrossed in paperwork.

"I'm going to grab my art supplies." I stood and headed for the door.

"Want company?" Sebastian glanced up.

"I'll be five minutes tops."

"I'll send out a search party after six." He grumbled, already refocusing on his documents.

"Promise?" I teased as I exited. He shot me a mock-threatening look that dissolved into a smile before returning to his work. I dashed upstairs, collected my supplies, and was back before he could miss me.

"Thirty seconds to spare." Sebastian noted dryly when I reappeared.

"Oops, let me try that again." I joked, settling onto the couch. Sketchpad in lap, I froze. What to draw? My mind drifted to Liam and his father planting that sapling earlier. Inspiration struck, and I began sketching what the tree might look like decades from now - a towering elm with sprawling branches, vibrant and full of life. The drawing consumed me until lunchtime.

"That's incredible." Sebastian's voice startled me - I hadn't noticed him behind me as I added final shading touches.

"It's how I imagine Liam's tree will look when it matures."

Sebastian took the sketchpad, studying it intently. "This deserves to be framed in our new office."

My breath caught. He'd never reacted negatively when I mentioned Liam before. Setting the sketchpad aside, he met my gaze. Without thinking, I threw my arms around his neck, kissing him fiercely. He caught me effortlessly, returning the kiss with equal passion.

"Thank you," I whispered when we parted.

"For what?"

"For not minding that I drew this... for Liam."

He cupped my face. "I made peace long ago that while I might not have been your first love, I'll be your last. Besides, Liam was your best friend and protected you countless times. He died saving you - for that, I'll always be grateful. If hanging your artwork helps you heal, then we'll display it proudly."

Words failed me, so I pulled him down for another searing kiss - until the door burst open revealing Oliver and Sophia.

"Oh! Sorry!" Sophia squeaked.

"Don't worry about it." I laughed as we separated. "What's up?" Sebastian carefully removed the sketch from my pad as they entered.

###Chapter 0153

"Just checking if you've had lunch yet. We're heading down to the kitchen now."

"We were about to do the same."

"Perfect!" Sophia grinned as she waited for me to grab my phone. Leaving my purse behind, we stepped out of the office and made our way to the bustling kitchen. The buffet was packed with options—pastas, fresh salads, warm bread, and an array of meats for sandwiches. A separate bar overflowed with colorful fruits and crisp vegetables.

I grabbed a piece of bread, assembled a quick sub, and scooped some pasta onto my plate before finding a seat. Just as I settled in, a little girl with long brown hair and deep chocolate eyes approached me shyly.

"Hello, Evelyn Andrews."

She couldn’t have been more than six or seven, with an adorable button nose and an innocent smile.

"HANNAH!" A woman I assumed was her mother rushed over, flustered. "I’m so sorry—she shouldn’t have bothered you."

"Wait!" I called out before she could pull her away. "I don’t mind at all. In fact, I love when people say hello." Standing, I crouched down to Hannah’s level and held out my hand. "How are you today?"

Her face lit up as she shook my hand. "I’m great! We’re going swimming later!"

"That sounds amazing! Do you like going underwater?" I noticed the entire kitchen had gone quiet, watching our exchange.

"I do! I can blow bubbles! But Mama says I can’t go in the deep end yet." She pouted, glancing up at her mother, who flushed in embarrassment.

"Well, mamas usually know best. Maybe we should always listen to her, right?"

"Oh yes, Luna! I always listen!" She nodded vigorously.

"Good girl. That makes me so happy." I smiled warmly at her.

"I made this for you at school." She held up a bracelet—pink and green beads spelling out Evelyn in white.

"You made this?" I gasped, accepting the gift.

"Yep! I like making new friends."

Sliding it onto my wrist, I admired it. "It fits perfectly! I’m so glad we’re friends now."

"Me too!" She threw her arms around me in a tight hug, which I returned with a laugh.

"Did you finish your lunch so you can swim?" I asked.

"Yep! Now that we’re friends, can I ask you something?" She suddenly grew nervous, fiddling with the hem of her mermaid swimsuit.

"Of course. What is it?"

"Mama’s really sad because she can’t find any new books to read me. She says our library is too small."

Her mother groaned, burying her face in her hands.

"Is that so?" I stood, glancing at her mom. "You need a bigger library?"

"It was just an offhand comment ages ago. I can’t believe she remembered."

"It’s okay." I knelt back down to Hannah’s level. "I love books. Let me see what I can do to make your mama happy, alright?"

"Thank you, Evelyn Andrews!" She beamed before looking up at her mother. "See, Mama? I told you she was nice."

"Oh, sweet heavens, child. Let’s go swimming." Her mother looked like she’d reached her embarrassment limit for the day.

"I have to go now. Bye, friend!"

"Bye!" I waved as she skipped off, then returned to my seat. The kitchen slowly buzzed back to life as I resumed eating.

"She was adorable," Sophia remarked with a smile.

"She really was. And now I have a bracelet—something you don’t have." I smirked.

"Guess I’ll have to start volunteering at the school to outdo you."

Sebastian leaned over, pressing a kiss to my forehead before going back to his sandwich. "Sophia, how’s the pool expansion coming along?"

"Great. Plans are finalized, and construction starts in the fall."

"Perfect. So, what’s next on your list?"

Sophia popped a strawberry into her mouth and grinned. "Something tells me it’s going to be a new library."

###Chapter 0154

The afternoon sun streamed through the windows as I leaned back in my chair, studying the architectural plans spread across the desk. "Let's assess the existing libraries first," I said, tapping the blueprints. "If we can upgrade them instead of building from scratch, that would be ideal. You can't replicate that kind of history."

Sebastian nodded, but his expression was distracted. "Give me this week. I took over the prom seating arrangements from Audrey. I still need to finalize everything and confirm with everyone."

My brows shot up. "Why didn’t you tell me?"

"It just happened this morning," he admitted with a shrug. "She called me in tears, saying she was overwhelmed. She asked if I could take some of the workload off her hands." A small smile tugged at his lips. "The system you set up for me is actually making this a lot easier."

"Come to the office this afternoon," I said, exhaling sharply. "I’ll help you finish the seating charts and make the calls." A pang of guilt twisted in my chest. "I wish she had called me instead."

Sebastian hesitated before answering. "She wanted to, but she didn’t want you to think she was weak or failing. She looks up to you, Scarlett. The last thing she wanted was to disappoint you."

The words hit me harder than I expected. Maybe I needed to do something for her—something to remind her she wasn’t alone. "That’s ridiculous."

"Is it?" Sebastian countered. "You pulled her out of that orphanage. You gave her a life. She owes you everything. So do dozens of others. You might not see it, but you’ve saved so many kids from falling into darkness."

I fell silent, absorbing his words. Then, a thought struck me. "Sebastian, tell Ethan to bring me his drawings today."

He didn’t respond verbally, just gave me a curt nod. Clearly, I needed to step in and relieve Audrey of her responsibilities. She had taken over my shop when I was drowning, and now it was my turn to carry the weight. If she was reaching out to Sebastian for help, she needed a break—badly.

We finished our meal in comfortable silence. Oliver cleared our plates as we stood, heading toward the office. Sophia dashed off to gather her prom materials while Sebastian and I settled in.

I picked up my phone and dialed Audrey’s number.

"Hello?" Her voice was thick with exhaustion.

"Audrey, are you okay?" I asked, sinking into my chair.

"I’m fine. Just taking it one day at a time."

"Audrey," I said softly, "don’t lie to me."

A choked sob escaped her. "I’m sorry—"

"Stop," I interrupted firmly. "You have nothing to apologize for. I know how much stress you’re under. Where’s Grayson?"

"Right here," he answered. I must have been on speaker.

"Good. Listen, I know you asked Sebastian to handle the prom stuff."

"I didn’t want him to tell you," Audrey rushed out. "I can handle it! I just—"

"Audrey, stop," I cut in gently. "It’s okay. I’m not mad. In fact, I’m proud of you for recognizing when you needed help. Asking for support doesn’t make you weak." Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Sebastian smirk and point a pen at me. I flipped him off without breaking stride. "I’m calling because I want you to take a break. Focus on yourself—and on Grayson."

"What do you mean?" she asked, confusion lacing her tone.

"I’m taking the shop back," I said simply. "You’ve already done most of the work, and it’s incredible. This isn’t a punishment—it’s a thank-you. You carried me when I was drowning. Now let me do the same for you."

Audrey’s quiet sobs filled the line.

"Thank you, Scarlett," Grayson murmured. "This will help her more than you know."

"Of course," I said. "If there’s anything else I can do—"

"Just stay safe," Grayson sighed.

"I will."

"Okay. Love you," he said.

"You too," I replied before hanging up.

Before I could say another word, a sharp knock echoed at the door.

It wasn’t even three yet. Who could that be?

###Chapter 0155

Sebastian's brow furrowed as he rose to answer the door. "What do you want?" He growled before turning back to his desk.

Isabella sauntered in and slammed the door shut. "I was hoping to catch you alone without that witch around."

"Did breaking one side of your face not teach you how to address your Luna properly?" I drawled from the couch without looking up.

She completely ignored me. "I came to discuss a promotion. Maybe working in the kitchen or something more prestigious within the pack."

I stood and deliberately settled onto Sebastian's lap, blocking her view of him entirely. Her glare could have melted steel.

"Actually," I said sweetly, "as Luna, packhouse staffing falls under my jurisdiction. So you'll need to speak with me." I rolled the chair forward and propped my elbows on the desk while Sebastian leaned back, clearly amused.

Isabella's face flushed crimson. "I wasn't talking to you."

Releasing my alpha aura, I watched it coil around her like smoke, forcing her to her knees in submission. "There, was that so difficult? Now about your request - you want a position."

"Y-yes," she ground out through clenched teeth. Sophia and Oliver chose that moment to enter, taking seats to observe the spectacle.

"Which department?" I inquired.

"The kitchen."

"Why there specifically?"

"I enjoy cooking," she spat, still pinned by my aura.

"Planning to poison me?" I joked lightly, not expecting her response.

"Y-yes." The whispered confession made Sophia and Oliver gasp. Sebastian shot up so fast I crashed into the desk, knocking the wind from me.

"YOU WHAT?" His roar shook the walls.

"I love you! Without her in the way, we could be happy together!"

"You're fortunate this was just talk," I said, straightening my shirt. "But since you've threatened your Luna's life, I have grounds to banish you. However..." I let the word hang. "I'd prefer to keep you where I can watch you. You'll clean the cells daily. You're banned from the packhouse kitchen - permanently. Understood?"

"Yes."

"Yes, what?"

"Yes... Luna," she seethed.

"Get out." I withdrew my aura and she scrambled up.

"One more misstep and I'll end you myself," Sebastian promised as she fled.

"Scarlett, you certainly know how to bring out people's true colors," Sophia joked weakly. Sebastian growled low in his throat as he pulled me back onto his lap, clearly still agitated.

"I do my best," I agreed. When Sebastian gave my thigh a reassuring squeeze, I moved to join Sophia. "What do we have?"

Oliver positioned himself behind Sebastian as they reviewed documents.

"Here's the finalized guest list with plus-ones, categorized by pack affiliation and humans." Sophia spread a map across the table showing circular six-top arrangements in staggered rows divided into four sections.

"We'll need head tables," I mused. "Our group here, Dominic's faction on the opposite side. Our table will seat us four plus Zachary and his date. Grayson's table will have him and Audrey with Nathan and Cassandra - though I doubt she'll attend, we should include her. Let's place Anthony and his date with Grayson since he's likely next in line for beta or gamma. Fill remaining seats based on known alliances."

###Chapter 0156

The seating chart took longer than anticipated, but it was finally completed. After multiple revisions, I sent it off to the committee for approval, making sure my name was clearly attached to prevent any last-minute changes. With all the calls made and vendors confirmed, prom preparations were officially wrapped up—until setup day, at least.

Knock! Knock! Knock!

Glancing at my phone, I saw it was 4:34 PM. "That must be Ethan," I murmured as Oliver walked past to answer the door.

"Luna Evelyn asked to see me," Oliver said, letting Ethan inside. The young wolf hesitated, casting a nervous glance at Sebastian before approaching me.

"Hey, Ethan. Did you bring your sketches?" I asked.

"Y-yes, Luna." His hands trembled slightly as he handed me the sketchpad.

"Why are you so nervous?" I flipped through the pages. The drawings were decent, though his shading needed work.

"Being summoned to the Alpha’s office… usually doesn’t end well, Luna."

Fair point. "These aren’t bad," I said, handing them back. "What are your plans for the summer?"

"Uh… not sure. Maybe warrior training by late summer?"

"How about an internship with me instead?" I suggested. "You could refine your technique and pick up some responsibility along the way. It might help you in the long run."

His eyes widened. "M-me? Why?"

"You’ve got potential, but you also have a knack for trouble," I said with a smirk. "I’ve worked with plenty of troublemakers who turned into top performers. I think you could thrive under my guidance—prove to Alpha Sebastian and everyone else what you’re capable of."

Ethan’s lips curled into a small smile. "Yes, Luna."

"Perfect. Leave your number, and I’ll call you when you can start—hopefully next week." He scribbled it down quickly.

"Thank you, Luna!" He beamed before turning to leave, then paused. "I can… go now, right?"

I chuckled. "Yes, you’re dismissed." He bolted out the door, nearly slamming it behind him.

"He’s going to be a handful," Oliver laughed, settling beside Sophia.

"Like someone else I know," I teased, dodging Sophia’s playful swat before retreating to the armchair.

My phone buzzed with an email notification. It was from the school—they needed in-person testing scheduled for Thursday. "Guys, we’ve got school exams on Thursday, proctored here."

Sebastian shrugged. "Fine by me."

I dialed Grayson’s number. Three rings later, he answered.

"Hello?"

"How’s it going?"

"Busy. What do you need?"

"Call me back when you’re free."

"I’ll swing by the pack in an hour. We’ll talk then."

"Okay."

"You good?"

"Yeah, fine. See you soon." I hung up, frowning.

"What’s wrong?" Sebastian asked.

"That call felt off. Grayson sounded… tense. I asked how he was, and he brushed me off."

"That’s not like him," Sophia muttered.

"I know. He said he’d be here in an hour. If he doesn’t show, we’re going to him."

"At least he answered instead of texting," Oliver pointed out.

"True." I exhaled, willing the next hour to pass faster.

Sophia clapped her hands. "Let’s grab dinner for all of us—including Grayson—and have a picnic under the oak tree. I’ll handle the setup. Meet me there in an hour!"

###Chapter 0157

"Thank you." I flashed her a grateful smile as they stepped out.

"Come here." Sebastian twisted in his chair, making space for me on his lap.

"What if it's about Dad?"

"Sweetheart, death comes for us all eventually." His voice softened. "I know you're not ready to lose him, but look at the life he's living—constantly shackled to someone like Margaret. He endured her for you and Grayson, but now Grayson can take over. If he passes, he’ll finally be free."

"I wish he’d just lock her up somewhere, keep her from poisoning the world with her presence."

"She’d just command someone to release her. Until Grayson becomes Alpha and strips her of her Luna status, there’s little anyone can do." Sebastian was trying to reason with me, but all I wanted was to hear she’d been thrown into a dungeon.

"I don’t know…"

"Why don’t you work on a sketch until Grayson gets here?" Sebastian suggested, nudging my thoughts away from Dad and my brother.

"I’ll try." Reluctantly, I stood and moved to the couch. Picking up my sketchpad, I began drawing Sebastian—starting with his eyes, though his entire face soon took shape. Normally, I stuck to black and white, but for him, I reached for the greens. Layering shades of black and emerald, I captured the intensity of his gaze—not anger, but something deeper.

So absorbed in perfecting the shadows, I nearly missed Sebastian rising to answer the door. "Grayson." He extended a hand.

Relief washed over me. "GRAYSON!" I leapt up and practically tackled him. He caught me, stumbling back a step. "I was so worried—"

Setting me down, he frowned. "Why? I told you I’d be here."

"You said you couldn’t talk to me! You never do that. I thought something happened." Grayson guided me back to the couch while Sebastian locked the door behind us.

"You caught me at a bad time." Grayson looked like he’d aged a decade.

"What’s going on?" Ignoring me, he picked up my sketch.

"This is incredible." Sebastian had settled beside me, lounging against the cushions. Grayson handed the drawing to him. "Have you seen this?"

"No." Sebastian studied it intently.

"I literally just finished it. Like, in the last hour." I watched him examine my work. "Do you like it?"

"I love it. This is stunning." He returned it to me.

"Just wait until it’s done." Setting it aside, I turned to Grayson. "Now, spill." My nerves spiked as he dropped his head, elbows on his knees.

"It’s been hell. Margaret’s shifted her focus from you to Audrey now." He still wouldn’t meet my eyes.

Guilt crashed over me. My hand flew to my mouth. "No…" I whispered.

"Yeah. It’s brutal. Dad’s threats mean nothing—she thinks she’s untouchable. I can’t be with Audrey every second, not with Dad piling responsibilities on me, and…" He trailed off, shaking his head.

"Oh, Audrey… and then everything with her father—" Sebastian leaned forward, his hand warm on my back, a silent anchor against my rising anxiety.

"Evelyn, Dad’s out of options." Grayson’s eyes pleaded for understanding. The fact he’d used my full name said everything.

"Oh, Dad…"

###Chapter 0158

The morning sun cast golden rays through the window as Grayson leaned against the desk, his expression solemn. "Sunday morning," he began, his voice low. "Dad is officially stepping down as Alpha. There will be a ceremony—one where I take his place, and Audrey becomes Luna. Only us, you, and your parents know about this." His gaze flickered to Sebastian before hardening. "Once it's done, he's going to reject Margaret, and I'll have her locked in the cells."

My breath hitched. "He won't survive the night." The words barely escaped my lips.

Grayson exhaled sharply. "He knows. But he won't let this continue. You've found your mate, and so have I. Dad hoped this would wait until I was closer to twenty-five—until he saw a grandchild. But this is how it has to be." His eyes darkened for a split second before clearing. "If Audrey got pregnant and Margaret caused her to lose the baby..." His jaw clenched. "This is the only way to stop her. Besides, Dad has wanted to be free of Margaret for fifteen years. He stayed to make sure you were safe—that you had a mate who would protect you—and that I was ready to lead. His duty is done." He rubbed his temples as if trying to erase the weight of their last conversation.

"Why Sunday?" I whispered.

Grayson's voice softened. "He wants to see his mission through. And... he wants to see you in your dress one last time." His eyes shimmered, but he blinked the moisture away before it could fall.

"Why am I only hearing about this now?"

"Because you're happy, Evelyn." His tone was firm but gentle. "For the first time in your life, despite everything, you're truly happy. Dad didn’t want to take that from you. You're loved here. Treated like the princess you are—" I shot him a look, and he smirked. "—and you're happy."

I couldn’t argue. Sebastian had given me more joy than I ever thought possible. He was everything I could have dreamed of in a mate—and more. "What does Margaret know about Sunday?"

"She thinks it's just a family brunch." Grayson sighed, sinking into the chair. "We'll hold the full ceremony later. Right now, the priority is protecting Audrey and doing what's best for the pack." He sounded like he was still convincing himself.

"Audrey can stay here this week," I offered.

Grayson shook his head. "Thank you, but I can't leave the pack right now—and I won't spend a week away from her. Could you stay away from Sebastian for that long?" He raised a brow.

I didn’t answer, just leaned back into Sebastian’s embrace. His arms tightened around me, warm and steady. "I don’t even know what to say."

"Only Alpha Benjamin and Luna Amelia know. Oliver and Sophia can’t find out until after. Only the four of you can be there. Oliver and Sophia will have to stay here."

Silence settled between us, heavy with unspoken thoughts. My mind drifted to memories—Dad pushing me on the swings, buying my first set of paints, proudly displaying my artwork for the whole pack to see.

"Evelyn." Grayson’s voice pulled me back.

"What?"

"After Dad... if he..." He swallowed hard. "Once I'm Alpha, all the property and investments transfer to me. We have to change the names on everything so Margaret can’t claim a single thing." He pulled out a binder I hadn’t noticed before. "This is for you and Sebastian only. Not even Alpha Benjamin can see it." His eyes locked onto Sebastian, demanding confirmation.

"You have my word." Sebastian sat up, though his arm remained around me.

Grayson slid the binder toward us. "Everything’s laid out inside. Audrey and I have already signed. There’s also a copy of Dad’s will." He hesitated. "I wish I could give you more time, but the lawyer needs this notarized immediately. That way, Margaret gets nothing—no claims, no rights."

The weight of his words pressed down on me. Sunday was coming. And with it, the end of an era.

###Chapter 0159

My fingers trembled as I flipped open the black binder. The first page bore the title of my father’s will. Pressing my palm against it, I had to steady my breathing before turning to the next page.

LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT

I, Alexander Jefferys, Alpha of the Crimson Fang Pack, being of sound mind and body, hereby declare this to be my final will and testament, revoking all prior versions.

Item I
Upon my passing, ownership of Fang Tattoo shall be transferred to my beloved daughter, Evelyn Jefferys. She shall have sole authority over the shop to pursue her dreams as she sees fit. It is my deepest wish that she continues to flourish and achieve greatness.

Item II
The bar, Moonhowl, shall be inherited by my children, Grayson Jefferys and Evelyn Jefferys. Grayson shall receive 51% of the profits, while Evelyn shall retain 49%. May they work together to build a prosperous future beyond the confines of our pack.

Item III
My precious daughter, Evelyn, has always been the light of my life. In appearance, she mirrors her mother, but her heart is mine. Her kindness reminds me daily of the woman I once loved. With each passing year, she grows more like her—both in beauty and generosity.

For this reason, I bequeath five million dollars to her. May she use it to travel, expand her business, or simply bring herself joy.

Item IV
The bulk of my estate, including leadership of the Crimson Fang Pack, shall pass to my firstborn, Grayson Jefferys, with an estimated net worth of twenty-five million dollars. Upon my death, he shall assume the title of Alpha without interference from any mate.

This includes 150,000 acres of farmland beyond our territory. However, should Grayson perish without an heir, ownership shall transfer to Evelyn. If an heir exists but is underage, Evelyn shall act as regent until they come of age.

Item V
Though these items hold no monetary value, I trust they will be treasured.

To Evelyn Jefferys:

The contents of 318 Crestview Drive, Destin, Florida. The key is enclosed in the attached envelope. While I leave it solely to her, I hope she shares it with her brother.
To Grayson Jefferys:

920 SW Washington Ave, a home once owned by Adalynn’s family. When she passed, I held it in trust until now. May Grayson and his mate raise a family there, fulfilling Adalynn’s wish—and the life I longed to give my children. The key is in a separate envelope.
The remainder of my personal profit shares. A full list is provided on the following page.
This concludes the LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT of Alexander Jefferys, Alpha of the Crimson Fang Pack.

Alexander Jefferys, Alpha of Crimson Fang Pack.

I exhaled sharply. "I... I have so many questions." Where to even begin? How was Crimson Fang worth so much? What other investments did Dad have? And what was in Florida? Why had he never mentioned Mom’s house?

Grayson sighed. "I know. I can’t stay much longer. All I can tell you is that Dad kept Mom’s family home a secret—he didn’t want Margaret destroying it. I only found out yesterday when he gave me these papers."

He paused, as if reading my mind. "He wouldn’t tell me what’s in Florida. The next page lists all his investments."

Flipping to it, my jaw dropped.

###Chapter 0160

"Did you have any idea about this?"

"None at all." Grayson exhaled sharply, running a hand through his hair. "I knew the pack's income didn't match what was coming in. I was aware of the farmland—technically owned by Dad, but worked by humans."

My fingers traced the long list of investments my father had made. "Yale? University of California? Why?"

"I'm not entirely sure what his involvement was, but I did some digging. They're two of the top art schools in the country." Grayson hesitated, glancing at Sebastian. "I think Dad wanted to ensure that... if your mate had been Liam, you'd have had an escape route. A way to leave the pack through art school. It was his way of securing both income and a backup plan for you."

The rest of the documents detailed restaurants, convention centers, even a luxury hotel. None of it added up.

"Evelyn," Grayson said quietly, "Dad told me he didn’t owe me explanations, but I believe he did all this because he saw how we were living. The first investment was made when we were seven—two years after Mom died, two years after he mated Margaret. I think he knew then that he needed an exit strategy. If everything fell apart, we’d have enough to survive—or disappear."

He flipped a page, revealing a contact list. "Some of these are human government officials."

"I know." Grayson's voice was steady, but his hands weren't. "Dad wasn’t as brilliant as you, but he was where you got your mind. He wanted you to learn responsibility, not just inherit wealth. And he hid it all so Margaret couldn’t touch it."

A bitter laugh escaped me. "You're going to be a very rich man."

"Dad knew I’d take care of you regardless. You have your share, but what’s mine is yours. Though," he added with a smirk, "Sebastian is more than capable of handling your needs. But if you ever—"

"When did Dad write this?" I interrupted, my throat tight.

"On our birthday. The day he found out you’d completed the mating bond with Sebastian." Grayson’s voice softened. "After everything that happened leading up to that day, Dad saw how committed Sebastian was to you. He told me Sebastian was already falling for you when he got shot. We both knew you’d be safe. Happy."

My chest ached. "He planned this for years."

"Since we were seven. Dad played the long game." Grayson turned the final page toward me, his hand trembling as he held out a pen. "Now, I need you to sign."

Evelyn Andrews

###Chapter 0161

"There, it's done." I pushed the will away, feeling a wave of disgust wash over me.

"I have to go, but I needed to tell you—Sebastian's father wants you to call him." Grayson stood, gathering his things.

"You think that's a good idea?" Sebastian asked, his voice cautious.

Grayson sighed. "I think he's ready to apologize. To forgive. He needs this closure. The tree is already planted. I had a plaque made in your name, so if he thanks you, that’s why."

"Are you okay?" I studied Grayson’s exhausted face. "You’re under so much stress right now."

"I’ll manage. I just need to get through this week. If luck is on our side, Dad might hold on a little longer."

I stood and pulled Grayson into a tight hug. He held me back like it might be the last time.

"Stay safe," he murmured against my hair. "I can’t afford to worry about you too." His eyes were haunted.

"She will be." Sebastian stood and wrapped an arm around me. Grayson nodded before turning to leave.

I buried my face in Sebastian’s chest, my heart aching.

"This whole thing has turned into a disaster," I muttered.

"I know." He guided me back to the couch. "You should probably just get the call over with."

"You’re right." With a shaky breath, I pulled out my phone and dialed Benjamin’s number. It rang twice before he answered.

"Hello?"

"Hi. It’s… Evelyn."

"Evelyn. Thank you for calling." His voice was softer than I expected.

"Of course. What did you need?" My fingers trembled around the phone.

"I wanted to apologize. For everything. I appreciate you letting me say what I needed to say. But I’m sorry for how I acted. I know you loved Liam. Not the way I wanted, but the Moon Goddess knows best. You’re a good person, and you deserve happiness. I hope you’ve found it."

"I have," I whispered, tears slipping silently down my cheeks.

"Good. And thank you for the plaque. You’ll always be like a daughter to me."

"Thank you."

"Take care." The line went dead.

"That went better than expected," Sebastian said as I leaned back against him.

"Yeah." My gaze drifted to the will on the table. "I still can’t believe what I just read."

"Neither can I. Your father really came through for you. Made sure you were taken care of."

"It doesn’t feel real. I never saw a cent of that money. Everything for the shop, I paid back myself. Dad gave me the start, but I didn’t earn a dime until I repaid him."

"You learned the value of hard work. Most alpha females expect everything handed to them."

"True."

"Does this change your travel plans?" Sebastian asked.

"I still want to see Florida."

"We can start there," he agreed.

"And my mother’s family house."

"We can, but we have to wait until after Saturday. We can’t risk anything going wrong."

"Okay. But I don’t know how I’m going to keep this from Sophia." The whole situation was unbearable. Just two weeks ago, my biggest concern was where I wanted to travel. Now, I wouldn’t trade Sebastian for anything, but the stress was overwhelming.

"You’ll be busy with the shop. Before you know it, Saturday will be here."

"Right." I didn’t even have the energy to work today.

"Do you want to watch movies this afternoon?"

"Seriously? You don’t have work?" I looked up at him.

"Nothing that can’t wait until tomorrow." He stood and held out his hand. "Come on. Let’s just relax. I have popcorn."

"What did I do to deserve such an amazing mate?" It was a rhetorical question, but Sebastian answered anyway.

"I am pretty great, aren’t I? Guess the Moon Goddess really loves you."

"Anyway…" I rolled my eyes. "What movie are we watching?"

As we headed to the couch, I let myself forget, just for a little while, about the chaos waiting outside.

###Chapter 0162

"What do you feel like watching?" Sebastian asked, stretching out on the couch.

"Something that'll make me laugh," I replied, curling my legs beneath me.

"Let me see what we've got." He unlocked the bedroom door with a smirk. "Why don’t you start the popcorn?"

"Yes, sir," I drawled, rolling my eyes.

"What happened to yes, Alpha?" He didn’t even glance at me, but I could hear the amusement in his voice.

"That’s reserved for the bedroom."

"Technically, we are in the bedroom."

I shot him a look. "When we’re naked in the bedroom and your dick is in my mouth—then you get the yes, Alpha."

"That can be arranged." He popped in a movie and flicked off the lights just as the opening credits rolled. The microwave beeped as the popcorn started popping, and he strolled over to me. "Water or Dr. Pepper?"

"Dr. Pepper, please." I grabbed a bowl and drummed my fingers on the counter. "What did you pick?"

"Bridesmaids."

"Seriously?" I blinked at him before breaking into a grin.

"What? It’s hilarious when she shits in the street."

The microwave dinged. Sebastian flopped onto the couch while I dumped the popcorn into a bowl. The buttery scent alone made my stomach growl. I shoved a handful into my mouth before settling beside him—close, but not touching. Instead, I placed the bowl between us, angling my body toward him as he hit play.

This was nice. Right. We didn’t need to be tangled up or fucking to enjoy each other’s company. Just sitting side by side, sharing popcorn, laughing at the ridiculous scenes, and judging the hideous bridesmaid dresses—this was its own kind of intimacy. The kind you only get when you’re completely comfortable with someone.

I knew I loved him. I knew we were still learning each other. But watching his face light up with laughter, I finally understood what it meant to have a second half. A soulmate.

This… this was my forever.

The next morning, my phone buzzed incessantly, jolting me awake. An email alert. Groaning, I cracked one eye open and squinted at the screen.

"What’s that?" Sebastian murmured, rolling over and dragging me against him.

"An email," I grumbled.

"About?"

"My store shipment’s arriving midday. They need a signature." I tossed my phone aside and burrowed deeper into him.

"Sweetheart, we need to get up. You’ve probably got a million things to do before then."

"But I’m comfortable," I whined, wiggling impossibly closer.

"Who knew you were the clingy type?" He chuckled.

"Excuse me?" I shoved him away and vaulted out of bed before he could react. "I am not clingy." I planted my hands on my hips, glaring—but he was biting his lip, fighting a laugh. "What’s so funny?"

"You are clingy. Now that you’ve let your walls down, you’re practically glued to me."

"Am not!"

"You love me." He gave me that infuriating, knowing look.

"Not right now!" Huffing, I stormed into the bathroom and slammed the door. His laughter followed me, echoing down the hall.

I refused to let him join me, so I made my shower quick—barely five minutes. Just as I stepped out, he walked in, towel slung low on his hips. My traitorous eyes flicked downward before I forced them away.

Nope. Not cracking already.

"Fast shower," he remarked, raising a brow.

"Got things to do." I breezed past him.

"Really? You’re going with the petty attitude all day?" Amusement rolled off him in waves.

"No idea what you’re talking about." I yanked on spandex and a workout tank, then twisted my hair into the side braid he loved. No makeup—just the necklace he’d given me.

By the time I laced up my shoes, he was out of the shower, towel dangerously loose. I averted my gaze.

Game on, Sebastian.

Tonight, he’d be the clingy one.

###Chapter 0163

Sebastian pulled on a pair of workout shorts and a sleeveless tank. As he bent to tie his sneakers, I saw my chance.

I let my phone slip from my fingers, sending it clattering to the floor.

Deliberately, I bent over to retrieve it—just out of his reach, but close enough to give him an eyeful. The sudden spike of arousal from him told me he noticed, but it was quickly smothered by amusement.

"Ready?" I asked, straightening up and heading for the bedroom door.

Sebastian rose, his gaze lingering on the necklace at my throat before meeting my eyes.

"Oh yes." His expression remained unreadable.

Damn. This might be tougher than I thought.

We stepped into the hallway, and he locked the bedroom door behind us.

"We have time for breakfast before heading to the store," I said.

"You want breakfast?" He sounded genuinely surprised.

"Maybe a muffin or something. Why?" His reaction puzzled me.

"You're not exactly a morning person. You barely eat breakfast, and lately, you’ve been picking at food like a bird." He shrugged.

Well, shit. When had he been paying that much attention?

"Maybe I’m tired of moping and want to feel happy for once," I said, sarcasm dripping from my words.

"I’d love for you to be happy, but life hasn’t exactly been kind lately. I half expected you to still be brooding."

"Glad to know I can still surprise you after all this time." I smirked, pushing open the kitchen doors.

Sebastian shot me a look that said he wasn’t buying it. Thankfully, he didn’t argue as we made our way to the buffet.

True to my word, I grabbed a double-chocolate muffin and a bottle of water, then sat down to wait for him.

By the time I finished eating, he still hadn’t joined me. Glancing over, I saw two girls had cornered him—and from the look on his face, he wasn’t thrilled.

Before he could escape, Oliver and Sophia strolled over to my table.

"Hey, girl. You’re up early. What’s the occasion?" Sophia gave me a knowing look.

"First, don’t say that in front of Sebastian. I’m making a point. Second, I got an email—our order’s being delivered today, and they need a signature. We’re heading over after he eats. Though at this rate, he might starve."

"What do they want with him?" Oliver asked.

"No idea. They walked up to him, and I didn’t care enough to eavesdrop." I shrugged, leaning back in my chair.

"You really don’t get jealous, do you?" Sophia shook her head.

"Not usually. Maybe I’m just weird like that."

"Don’t worry, I love it when you get jealous over me," Oliver murmured, tracing a finger down Sophia’s cheek before kissing the tip of her nose.

"Ugh. Disgusting. Literally disgusting."

Sebastian finally sat down as I spoke.

"What’s disgusting?"

"Them. Just… them."

"Don’t hate on us just because you’re incapable of being an affectionate mate!" Sophia shot back.

"Sebastian, am I an affectionate mate?"

"Absolutely," he said, taking a bite of his food.

"See?"

"Then why don’t you kiss him? Prove it!" Sophia challenged.

"It’s like you don’t even know me." I rolled my eyes, refusing to give in to her peer pressure.

"Sebastian, doesn’t it bother you that she never gets jealous?" Sophia pressed, irritation creeping into her voice.

"No. Why would it? That’s not who she is." He shrugged.

"We’re not the weird ones here. You two are the odd ones," she huffed, crossing her arms and pretending to glare.

"Are you the jealous type, Sebastian?" Sophia switched tactics.

###Chapter 0164

"She hasn't given me a reason to be jealous," Sebastian said after a pause.

"So, you'd be totally fine if some random guy walked up and hugged her?" Sophia challenged, crossing her arms.

"If a stranger tried to touch her, she'd probably break his nose before he got close," Sebastian replied without hesitation. Sophia huffed but couldn't argue with that.

"Whatever. One of these days, one of you is going to snap, and I'll be there to say I told you so." She jabbed a finger at us. "Mark my words—it will happen, and you two will deserve it." With that, she stormed out, though Oliver barely hid his smirk as he followed her.

"When was the last time she got laid?" Sebastian asked dryly.

"Clearly, Oliver isn't keeping up with his duties," I laughed as Sebastian finished his meal. Then, curiosity got the better of me. "Do you ever get jealous?"

"Only before we were mates. Back when you were still keeping me at arm's length, and I couldn't figure you out." He shrugged, but I knew there was more to it. He’d never admit it, but I was sure Liam had gotten under his skin.

"Hmm…" That almost sounded like an invitation to test him, but I respected him too much to play games.

"Don’t you dare try it," he warned, reading my thoughts effortlessly.

"Me? I would never," I gasped, feigning offense. Sebastian rolled his eyes as he stood and tossed our trash away. Nearby, a group of girls giggled—I hadn’t even realized we had an audience.

"Ready?" he asked, pushing in his chair.

"Yeah." I stood and walked ahead of him to the car. Part of me wanted to take our bikes, but if we needed to haul anything back, that wouldn’t work. Plus, this gave me the perfect opportunity to mess with him.

The moment he pulled out, he hit the gas hard enough to send my phone flying into the backseat.

"Seriously?" Sebastian arched a brow. "A bit dramatic, don’t you think?"

"Oops, sorry," I said, twisting around to grab it. I made a show of struggling, deliberately shoving my backside toward him.

"Need help?" he asked after a minute.

"Nope, got it!" I chirped, sitting back up.

"Good." His hand settled possessively on my thigh.

"Have you seen my—"

"No, why?"

"Just curious."

"You’re unusually chatty today," he muttered.

"Sorry?" I frowned, turning to the window.

"Not complaining. Just saying you’re acting… different."

"Different like Sophia?"

"No one is like Sophia," he deadpanned.

"True." Deflated, I slumped against the seat and sulked, just to match his expectations. The rest of the drive passed in silence, which surprised me. I was annoyed, but he didn’t even acknowledge it.

When we arrived at my shop, I didn’t wait for him, marching inside alone.

Everything was exactly as I’d ordered—still wrapped, untouched. The chairs needed assembling, my office laptop sat sealed in its box, and a fine layer of dust coated every surface.

Starting at the front, I took it all in. The reception desk was taller than I’d imagined, giving me a clear view of the shop while maintaining privacy. Behind it was my office—small but efficient, with a compact desk against the wall.

Then I noticed it—a large object in the corner, draped with a blanket. A sign taped to it read: Scarlett—Keep Out.

Moving on, the 360-degree mirror beside the bathroom was flawless. They’d expanded the bathroom slightly but kept the layout intact. The sage green walls were perfect—exactly how I’d envisioned.

The cabinets were stunning. The ink room was narrow but lined with shelves, and a single waist-high counter provided the perfect workspace.

It was everything I’d wanted.

Everything I needed.

###Chapter 0165

I scanned the newly renovated tattoo parlor, my fingers tracing the freshly painted walls. Sebastian stood nearby, observing my reaction with those piercing blue eyes. "Well?" he prompted.

"It's incredible." I grabbed a box cutter and began slicing through the protective plastic covering the leather chairs.

"Just incredible?" His eyebrow arched in that infuriatingly perfect way.

"Breathtaking? Spectacular? What exactly were you hoping I'd say?" My voice carried an edge I couldn't disguise.

Sebastian sighed dramatically. "Your emotional pendulum is exhausting."

The box cutter clattered to the floor as I whirled on him. "You want to talk about exhausting? Let's recap my week, shall we? Signed my father's death warrant, got told he might not survive Sunday, watched my shop get demolished, buried one of my closest friends, survived two rogue attacks and car accidents. Oh, and let's not forget the psychopath who thinks he owns me. Frankly, I think I'm handling this remarkably well considering."

My wolf stirred beneath my skin, and I saw Sebastian's pupils dilate in response to my shifting eyes. The rage built like a storm inside me.

"I tried being positive earlier and you hated that. Now I'm upset and you're still complaining. What the hell do you want from me? I've given you everything - my heart, my body - and now you're grading my trauma responses?" My voice cracked. "You've been my rock through all of this... until now. What more can I possibly give?"

Sebastian raised his hands in surrender as he approached. "You're right. I'm sorry."

"Don't apologize!" I stepped back, crossing my arms. "Tell me how you think I should be reacting to all this. Enlighten me."

His hands settled on my shoulders, and despite my anger, the familiar warmth of his touch immediately soothed me - which only pissed me off more. "I just want you to process this properly. Using humor or sex as coping mechanisms won't change what's happened. Bottling everything up isn't healthy."

"I'll deal with my emotions when I'm damn well ready," I snapped, shrugging him off. "Did you see Grayson earlier? My always-composed, level-headed brother looked ready to shatter. That alone should tell you how bad things are. And where am I? Not there helping him. No, I'm hiding here like a coward while Audrey takes my place as Margaret's emotional punching bag."

I started counting off on my fingers, each digit representing a fresh wound. "Guilt for abandoning Grayson. Heartbreak over my father. Confusion about Florida. Rage at Dominic for what he did to you. Grief for Liam - one of my best friends died protecting me, Sebastian. And yet somehow I still feel guilty for being happy with you when all this is happening."

My voice dropped to a whisper. "I'm terrified that because of me, you haven't completed your Alpha transition. Your mother made it clear - any challenger could come for you now. I know you'd win, but the thought of our bond transferring if..." I couldn't finish the sentence.

"And through all this, I'm still expected to celebrate the pack's victories, be thrilled about the shop renovations, rejoice for Sophia's pregnancy. What exactly is left of me to give, Sebastian? I'm running on empty." The tears wouldn't even come anymore - I was too drained.

Sebastian's expression softened as he pulled me into his chest. The steady rhythm of his heartbeat beneath my ear grounded me. "You don't have to be anything right now," he murmured into my hair. "Just be here. With me."

For the first time in days, I let myself collapse against him, my fingers clutching his shirt like an anchor in the storm. Maybe tomorrow I'd find the strength to face everything. But for now, this was enough.

###Chapter 0166

Sebastian didn’t move, his piercing gaze locked onto me. His expression was unreadable, giving away nothing of what he was feeling. After what felt like an eternity of silence, I exhaled sharply and turned back to my task. Dropping to my knees, I pulled out the assembly instructions and began unwrapping the packaging.

No matter how hard I tried to ignore him, Sebastian remained rooted in place, watching my every move. Finally, he turned away, grabbing a handful of rags and methodically wiping down the surfaces.

We worked in tense silence for nearly an hour before a sharp knock echoed from the front door. I had just finished assembling one of the chairs when I realized my order had arrived. Sebastian set his things aside and went to answer it. After signing the delivery slip, three men hauled in multiple boxes, stacking them in the center of the shop.

This was far more than just ink.

As they left, I stared at the pile, bewildered.

"What in the world did she buy?" I muttered under my breath. Snatching a pair of scissors, I tore into the boxes. Inside, I found a bathroom mirror, a toilet paper holder, and other small fixtures. There was even a sleek bookstand—for a portfolio I didn’t own yet. Audrey had practically furnished my entire office.

While Sebastian organized the ink supplies, I kept breaking down boxes and cleaning up. At one point, he stepped outside to take a call.

I wasn’t sure what to feel about him anymore. A strange loneliness settled over me, an ache for reconciliation. I wanted to bridge the gap between us, to just hug him—but my stubborn pride kept me rooted in place.

Once everything was unpacked and the cardboard flattened, I carried the pile to the back for recycling. When I returned, Grayson stood in the middle of my shop.

"Grayson?" I frowned, flicking a glance at Sebastian. Neither man gave anything away. "This can't be good."

"Nothing's wrong," Grayson assured me, though his small smile did nothing to ease my nerves.

"Then why are you here? Is Audrey okay?"

"She's fine. I sent her to stay at our mother’s house. She’s not allowed to leave, and I visit when I can. This way, she’s out of the packhouse but still close enough that my wolf doesn’t lose it."

A dozen questions swirled in my mind, but none made it past my lips. Instead, I studied both men, trying to piece together what was happening.

"I’m literally the smartest person I know, and right now, I’m completely lost. Someone better start talking."

"You’re not okay," Grayson finally said.

My eyes snapped to Sebastian. "You called my brother because I yelled at you?"

"It’s not me you need comfort from right now," Sebastian replied, his tone edged with frustration—and something else. Resignation?

Grayson exhaled. "Everything’s official. Copies were made. Now, we wait. Until Saturday, the only thing we have to look forward to is Thursday’s tests." His arms dropped to his sides as he spoke, but he made no move toward me.

"Audrey’s safe?" I pressed.

"Yes. She’s under guard, but the house is incredible. You’ll love it—two stories, full basement. A little outdated, but it’s exactly like what we imagined our mom’s place would be. Remember when we were kids, designing our pretend mother’s home? That’s this house." A faint smile tugged at his lips.

"And Dad?"

###Chapter 0167

"Father has been organizing his office. Setting up encrypted files for me to access. Essentially preparing to transfer the Alpha title. Honestly, he seems happier than I’ve seen him in years."

"Happy?"

"Yes, Scarlett. He’s genuinely happy. Finally free of Margaret. I learned more of the story. Margaret and Dad dated when they were young, but when he discovered his true mate was Mom, he ended things with her. Margaret never moved on. So when Mom passed, guess who swooped in to 'comfort' him? His wolf was suffering, and she was there. One night, when it got unbearable, Dad agreed to mate with her just so he could stay alive to raise us. Back then, she did everything for us, so he thought she’d be a decent mate. But as we grew older, it became obvious she resented us for not being her own. That’s when he started investing—because he barely survived mating with her, and he refused to leave us orphaned. Now that we’re capable, he’s relieved. He’s ready to let go, whatever happens."

"But earlier, you said—"

"I know what I said. But Dad and I talked last night. He told me everything. This isn’t a choice he regrets—it’s one he’s been waiting for. I think he’ll be grinning when he finally cuts ties with her."

I lowered my gaze, processing his words. It made sense. That didn’t make it easier, but at least I didn’t feel as guilty. "And Saturday?" I asked, looking back up at him.

"We don’t scare easily. We’ll strike, and we’ll enjoy every second of it. But you have a role to play, Scarlett. Dominic won’t see it coming, so we all need to be careful. Still, I have a feeling Saturday’s going to be a damn good night." Grayson smirked, rocking back on his heels as he glanced at Sebastian. Sebastian nodded but kept his eyes locked on me.

It was a bitter truth to swallow. I understood why he’d want freedom, but I’d never comprehend why he endured eighteen years of misery. Maybe someday, if I had children, I’d get it. But right now, my heart ached for him.

"Did you find anything with the phones?" I asked.

"They’re linked to a building in the city. No confirmation yet, but it’s one we’ve been watching for connections to Alpha Damian. The messages were clear—they wanted to kidnap you."

"So, I was right." I glanced between the two most important men in my life.

"You were. Your life is in serious danger," Grayson confirmed. "But you can finish up here. We’re not asking you to shut down your shop—"

"—but keeping it open puts me and others at unnecessary risk," I finished for him.

"Exactly." Grayson slid his hands into his pockets.

After a long pause, I sighed. "I’ll hold off until this is over."

"Smart move." He couldn’t resist teasing. I scowled in response. "This place is really coming together, though."

"Thanks to Audrey. She pulled through." My frustration faded as I admitted it.

Grayson stepped closer, wrapping his arms around me. "Everything will be okay. Sometimes, it’s okay to be selfish and protect yourself. The only reason I can handle what’s coming is because I know you’re safe here. Are you happy?"

I peeked at Sebastian. "Mostly."

Sebastian rolled his eyes. "Scarlett?" Grayson nudged me lightly.

"Yes, I’m happy."

He tilted my face toward his. "Do you feel safe?"

###Chapter 0168

"That's all that matters to me. Seventeen years of my life have been dedicated to watching over you, making sure you were safe and happy. I love you, but damn, you've taken up a huge chunk of my existence." Grayson teased, his grin lopsided.

"Wow, how touching," I deadpanned, fighting the urge to smile.

"Knowing you're safe and happy here lets me focus on what I need to do. Yeah, I was pissed, stressed, and frustrated—but look at me now. Twelve hours later, and I'm back to my usual charming self. All problems solved. Your only job is to worry about yourself and acing that test on Thursday."

"I could've passed those when I was ten," I muttered, annoyed but still biting back a smirk.

"If you had, you wouldn't have met Sebastian," Grayson pointed out smugly.

"I met him here, not at school," I countered.

"But it was school where he first heard about you."

"That's a stretch, but fine. Since I'll score higher than you ever did, I'll let you have that one." I gave his arm a playful pat.

"What a sweet little sister!" Grayson ruffled my hair before yanking me into a tight hug.

"Can't—breathe!" I gasped dramatically after a few seconds.

"You good now?" He pulled back but kept his hands on my shoulders, studying me.

"Yeah."

"You could stand to have a little more faith in me," Grayson fake-pouted. "I lose my cool one time, and this is how you react?"

"Hey! It wasn’t just you—it was everything. The last two weeks have been… a lot." I smacked his arm lightly.

"Fair. But remember—it’s okay to not be okay. I need you strong in public, but behind closed doors? You don’t have to hold it together. I’d say cry, but…" He trailed off with a smirk.

"Okay, we’re done talking about this." I rolled my eyes, emotions already too raw after he’d just pieced me back together.

"Love you, sis."

I hesitated.

Grayson raised a brow. "Thought you were over that?"

"Over what?"

"Your whole I-don’t-say-I-love-you phase."

"I save it for real heartfelt moments," I shot back, giving him a look.

"This isn’t heartfelt?"

"You’ve always been the cheesy one." I laughed.

"Alright, fine. Love you, but I gotta go."

"L-love you too," I muttered sarcastically.

"Needs work, but I’ll take it." He shook his head, amused, before turning to shake Sebastian’s hand. They even did that obnoxious bro-hug thing before Grayson finally left the shop.

I stood there awkwardly, avoiding Sebastian’s gaze until he sighed and closed the distance between us.

"Better now?"

"Maybe," I mumbled, staring at the floor.

A low growl rumbled in his chest before he bent down, gripping the backs of my thighs and lifting me effortlessly. My legs wrapped around his waist as he carried me to the counter and set me down, caging me in. One hand cupped the nape of my neck, fingers tangling in my hair, forcing me to meet his eyes. A soft sound escaped my lips as I drowned in his gaze.

"I’ll never understand the hold Grayson has on you," Sebastian murmured, voice rough. "But this body? It’s mine to take care of." His lips crashed against mine, stealing my breath. My hands slid under his shirt, tracing the hard planes of his skin. Too soon, he pulled back, searching my face.

"I’m sorry," I blurted without thinking.

"Nothing to apologize for." His thumb brushed my cheek.

"Feels like there is."

"Are you happy with me?" The question caught me off guard.

"What kind of question is that?" I frowned. "After everything we’ve been through, you’re seriously asking me that?"

###Chapter 0169

"No, I'm not questioning it. I just wanted to hear you say it."

"Sebastian, you make me the happiest woman alive." My fingers slipped from his shirt to trace the sharp lines of his jaw. "You're my mate, the missing piece of my soul, the love of my existence. You get all of me—the good, the messy, the unpredictable. Lucky you, dealing with my ever-changing moods."

Sebastian cradled my face between his hands as I spoke. His thumbs brushed my cheeks, his gaze unwavering. "You know I'd die before letting anything happen to you," I murmured, as if he needed the reassurance.

"You took a bullet for me. I don’t need convincing." I tugged him down, sealing my words with a slow, lingering kiss.

When we finally pulled apart, he exhaled roughly. "We should get back to work."

I smirked, gripping the hem of his shirt. "Let me help with that." I tugged it off him, tossing it aside. "Much better."

"Me being shirtless is better?" He arched a brow, though amusement flickered in his eyes.

"Absolutely. Eye candy makes manual labor more bearable." I flashed him a grin, and despite his attempt to stay stern, the corner of his mouth twitched.

"Get your ass back to work," he growled, though his hands lingered on my waist as he lowered me to the ground.

"Yes, Alpha." I sauntered away, deliberately swaying my hips. His gaze darkened, but he turned back to sweeping up the dust, his muscles flexing with each movement.

Fifteen minutes later, the first tattoo chair stood assembled. "Only three more to go."

Sebastian strode over, inspecting my handiwork. "Looks solid."

"Thanks. This one’s mine." I wiped my hands on my jeans just as the bell above the door chimed. A group of teenagers filed in, led by Ethan.

"We heard you were setting up today. Need any help?" Ethan grinned, his friends glancing around in awe.

"Actually, yes. You guys can tackle these chairs!" Relief flooded me.

Ethan studied the instructions. "Shouldn’t be too hard."

"That one took me over an hour," I admitted as Sebastian helped me to my feet.

"Damn. Okay." The kids immediately got to work, freeing me to organize the rest of the shop. Sebastian hung mirrors and arranged the decor Audrey had picked out. While he set up the ink stations, I rearranged them to my liking before retreating to my office.

As I unboxed the laptop, my elbow knocked something over. "What was that?" I reached behind the desk, retrieving a framed photo—Sebastian and me, smiling under the moonlight.

"I had it printed. Thought it’d look good in here." Sebastian leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed, looking unfairly attractive.

"That’s… really sweet." I set it back in place, warmth spreading through my chest.

"Everything’s cleaned up. Bathroom’s ready too." He didn’t move, watching as I powered on the laptop.

"You’re incredible." I shot him a grateful smile.

"Can we talk?" He stepped inside, shutting the door behind him. My office wasn’t spacious, but with him this close, it felt cozy rather than cramped.

"Uh-oh." I eyed him warily.

"Next Monday, I want us to go to Florida. For a week." My entire body locked up. The laptop chimed, prompting for setup confirmation. I mechanically clicked through, my mind racing.

"Why?"

"You’ve been under constant stress. Don’t even try to argue." He knew me too well. "If your dad takes a turn for the worse, we’ll go. If not, we’ll wait."

###Chapter 0170

"This isn't exactly a vacation, nor would I call it relaxing." Sebastian leaned against the counter, watching me. "I think your father left something for you there. I looked up the address—it's a storage unit. My guess? He took all your mother's belongings and hid them there. With Margaret gone, you can finally have them. You should go and see what's inside."

"A storage unit?" I turned to face him, my heart skipping a beat. He knelt on one knee, his dark eyes serious.

"Yes. This isn’t about getting you away from anything. Whatever’s in there, your father thought it was important enough to hide. Somewhere Margaret obviously never knew about. If he left it for you, he wanted you to have it. To cherish it."

"I always assumed my mother’s things would still be in her house," I murmured, chewing my lip.

Sebastian shook his head. "That house was on her territory. As Luna, she could’ve destroyed everything if she wanted to. This way, he kept them safe. Even if the house burned down, her memories would still be there."

"That... makes sense, I guess."

"Just think about it, okay?" His voice softened.

"I will."

"Good." He stood, stretching. "How much longer do you need here?"

"Why?"

"I was thinking we could take the bikes out this afternoon." A slow smirk curled his lips.

I grinned, shutting my laptop. "I like the way you think."

Sebastian held the office door open for me as we stepped out.

"We're done!" Ethan announced proudly, wiping his hands on his jeans. The three chairs were secured to the floor, and the other kids had already cleared the trash and swept up.

"Looks amazing!" I beamed, admiring their work.

"Everything’s pretty much set," I said, glancing around. My stomach growled—I hadn’t eaten since breakfast.

"When are you opening?" Sophia asked, leaning against the counter.

Sebastian tugged his shirt back on. "Not sure yet."

He held the door open as Ethan and his crew filed out. We followed, locking up behind them.

"That was a good thing you did for him," Sebastian said once we were in the car.

"Someone had to step in for Audrey."

"Is that even possible?" He chuckled, pulling onto the street. I rolled down the window, letting the breeze rush over my fingers.

"Nope. She was one of a kind." I sighed. "Any updates on her father?"

"Nothing yet. We’re keeping it quiet until after Saturday." His hand settled on my thigh, warm and reassuring.

"I’m starving," I admitted.

"Now that’s a first." He smirked. "BBQ sound good?"

"Yes, please."

"Alright. Let’s change first, then head out."

"Should we invite Sophia and Oliver?" I asked.

Sebastian frowned. "We haven’t hung out with them in a while."

"Plus, we kind of pissed Sophia off this morning. Might be a good peace offering."

"She pissed herself off this morning," he grumbled.

I burst out laughing, and soon, he joined me. "You’re not wrong," I gasped, wiping my eyes as we pulled into the garage.

"Are you going to ask them, since I still can’t mind-link anyone?" I teased as we headed inside.

"We really need to fix that," he muttered.

"Well, your mother’s handling it. You’ll have to ask her when you finally claim me." I smirked, nudging him as we climbed the stairs.

We stopped on the second floor, knocking on Oliver’s door.

###Chapter 0171

"We could just have a small ceremony in dad's office for the mind-linking," Sebastian suggested as he knocked on the door.

"Though I'm not sure I want Ethan to have that kind of access to my thoughts," I laughed as Oliver opened the door.

He was only wearing shorts. "Did we interrupt something?"

"No," Oliver shrugged, stepping aside to let us in. Sophia sat on the couch, typing furiously on her laptop. "We're just working from our room today."

"Why?" I walked over to her, noticing the glare she shot my way. "Still mad?"

"I was never mad."

"Good, because we were about to invite you two to grab some BBQ with us." Leaning over, I saw she was designing a new pool. "You can't put the slides there. They need to be here," I pointed out immediately.

"What? Why?"

"You can't have the slide drains overlapping the pool drains."

Sophia frowned, slamming her laptop shut as she stood. "I could use some air and food. But if you're going to glance at my blueprint and find a flaw in two seconds, then you're coming to the pool with me this afternoon to help fix it."

I studied her. She'd been unusually moody lately—her face slightly puffy, her skin glowing. "Are you pregnant?"

Both guys' jaws dropped. Sophia paled, her mind racing. "Pregnant? You think I'm pregnant?"

"Your mood swings... just, when was your last period?"

Sophia opened her mouth but hesitated. "Sophia?" Oliver asked, clearly stunned.

"You two have been together long enough that if you got pregnant the first time, you could be. Wolf pregnancies move fast—especially for ranking members." I shrugged.

Sophia bolted to the bathroom, slamming the door. Drawers opened and closed before a shaky voice called out, "Yeah. It's early, but... possible. You've been mated a week longer than us."

Oliver paced as I moved to stand beside Sebastian. The clock ticked loudly, each second stretching. Oliver looked ready to explode when Sophia finally emerged, trembling. She covered her mouth, nodding.

"You're pregnant?" Oliver confirmed, stepping closer.

"I am..." She handed him the test, her hands shaking too much to hold it steady.

"Oh, Soph." Oliver pulled her into a tight hug, his own emotions raw. "I'm going to be a dad?"

Loosely slipping my arm through Sebastian's, we watched them process the news. Tears streamed down Sophia's face faster than Oliver could wipe them away. "Let's give them space," I whispered. Sebastian nodded, and we quietly left for our own room.

"You could be pregnant too," Sebastian said after a moment.

"Too early to tell. But yeah, maybe. Not ideal timing—we should be more careful." I tugged off my pants and grabbed a tank top.

"I don't know. A little kid running around sounds fun. They'd be the same age as Oliver and Sophia's—best friends."

"You want a kid now?" I raised a brow. "What happened to traveling?"

"The kid can come with us. I want a whole pack of them." Sebastian wrapped his arms around me from behind. "You'd look so damn sexy carrying my child."

"Slow down—there's no baby yet!" I pushed him away to pull my pants back on.

"There will be if you keep wearing those." He made a show of eyeing me up and down as I tucked my tank top in.

###Chapter 0172

"I thought you preferred me without any clothes?" I teased as Sebastian stuck out his tongue and lunged at me playfully. Dodging his advance, I snatched up my boots from the floor.

"Oh, I do," he admitted with a smirk, pulling his shirt over his head. "But I love the anticipation—seeing what I want and then having to work for it."

"Well, I doubt Sophia and Oliver will be up for swimming, but we could always sneak back to that hidden pond in the woods after dinner," I suggested, sauntering toward him. My fingers trailed down my sides, lingering over my curves before sliding past my thighs. His eyes darkened instantly.

Sebastian leaned against the couch, making it easy for me to slip between his legs and press my body flush against his. His hands immediately found my backside, gripping possessively.

"Mmm, I like that idea," he murmured, his breath warm against my skin.

I wrapped my arms around his neck, arching into him as my fingers tangled in his hair. Our lips brushed, teasing, before he captured mine in a deep kiss. His mouth moved to my neck, then lower, his teeth grazing the swell of my breast. One hand cupped me roughly, sending a jolt of pleasure through me.

"But, Alpha..." I whispered against his ear, relishing the way his entire body shuddered at the title. Goosebumps rose along his skin, his grip tightening. "I wouldn’t want to ruin your appetite."

I nipped at his throat, earning a low growl in response.

A sharp knock at the door interrupted us just as Sebastian’s fingers dug into my flesh. "Hold that thought," I breathed, giving him one last quick kiss before pulling away.

"I’m going to murder them," he muttered, adjusting himself before nodding for me to answer the door.

"Hey!" Sophia and Oliver stood on the other side, grinning.

"Congratulations! We’re so happy for you!" Sophia rushed in, pulling me into a tight hug while Oliver clasped Sebastian’s hand.

"Thanks. Still feels surreal," Sophia admitted, beaming. "Mind if we still join you for dinner? I’m starving."

"Of course," I said, though I couldn’t hide my disappointment at the interruption.

"We can still ride," Oliver added. "It’s safe, so we’re ready whenever you are."

Sebastian cleared his throat. "Go ahead and get the bikes ready. I need to talk to Evelyn for a second."

Oliver nodded, and Sophia winked before they headed out.

The moment the door closed, Sebastian grabbed the back of my neck and spun me around, crushing his lips to mine. His other hand made quick work of my pants, unbuttoning them before shoving me onto the couch.

I was still wet from earlier, and when he pushed my clothes down just enough, his fingers slid in effortlessly. "Oh, yes, Alpha!" I moaned into his mouth.

Sebastian didn’t hold back. He flipped me over, bending me against the couch. I heard the rustle of his own pants dropping before he thrust into me without warning, driving out every ounce of pent-up tension. His hand fisted in my hair, yanking my head back as I cried out.

"Fuck, you’re tight," he growled, his pace relentless.

"SEBASTIAN!" I screamed as my climax hit, his own release following instantly.

He pulled me upright, looking far too pleased with himself. "And that," he murmured, "is how you make a baby."

I arched a brow. "You that eager to be a dad?"

###Chapter 0173

"Absolutely, why not?" Sebastian flashed me a warm smile as I slipped into the bathroom to freshen up. The idea of motherhood both thrilled and terrified me—mostly because of the constant threats looming over us.

"I'm ready," I announced, stepping back into the room.

"Come here." Sebastian leaned against the couch, arms open. This time, I paused between his legs, resting my head against his chest. His heartbeat steadied me. "Tell me what's holding you back," he murmured.

"It's just... with everything going on—the kidnappings, the rogues—what if something happens to the baby? If I'm pregnant, I can't shift. What if we're ambushed again? I won’t be able to protect us."

"First of all, danger could strike any day, pregnant or not," he reasoned, his voice calm. "But if it eases your mind, we’ll take extra precautions until things settle down."

"Thank you," I whispered, tilting my head up. He pressed a soft kiss to my lips before giving my backside a playful smack.

"We should get moving before they come looking for us," he said, standing and pulling me toward the door.

"Though, for all we know, I might already be pregnant," I mused, glancing around to ensure we were alone in the stairwell.

"Little Sebastian Jr.," he teased, testing the name on his tongue.

I burst out laughing as we stepped into the garage.

"Finally!" Oliver called out.

"Sorry. Sebastian had business to take care of," I quipped, grinning at the glare I could practically feel burning into me.

"Men take forever," Sophia agreed, strapping on her helmet.

"Preach," I said, blowing Sebastian a kiss before swinging my leg over my bike. He just shook his head, securing his own helmet.

Sophia and I led the way as we hit the open road. The wind whipped against my skin, the hum of the engine syncing with my pulse. Taking the scenic route, we drank in the untouched wilderness around us—nature’s quiet masterpiece.

All too soon, we arrived at my favorite barbecue spot. For some reason, I felt clingy, threading my fingers through Sebastian’s as we walked inside. He arched a brow but didn’t pull away, even when we had to separate to slide into the booth.

"Table for four?" the hostess asked.

"Yes, please," Sophia answered brightly.

"Perfect. Right this way." She grabbed menus and led us to a corner booth. "Will this work?"

"It’s great, thanks," I said, sliding in beside Sebastian. Sophia and I took the inside seats, while Sebastian and Oliver flanked the outside. His hand settled on my thigh, warm and possessive. I looped my arm through his, holding on tight.

Sophia noticed instantly. She knew I wasn’t usually one for PDA, so this was big. Instead of calling me out, she just smirked and picked up a menu—a kindness I appreciated.

"Mr. Sebastian and Ms. Evelyn! So glad you're back!" Gabriella beamed as she approached.

"Thanks! Are you serving us today?" I asked.

"Sure am." Her gaze flicked to our linked arms. "What can I get you all?"

"Dr. Pepper for me," I said.

"Iced tea," Sebastian replied.

"Tea with lemon, please," Sophia chimed in.

"Mt. Dew," Oliver added with a charming smile—earning an elbow nudge from Sophia.

"Got it. Any appetizers?" Gabriella asked, expertly ignoring their antics.

###Chapter 0174

"Oh, those jalapeño poppers?"

"Yes, could we get an order of those?" Sebastian requested, his fingers tapping lightly against the menu.

"And fried pickles!" Sophia blurted out, then immediately flushed and sank back into her seat.

"Absolutely! I'll put those in right away." Gabriella smiled warmly before heading toward the kitchen.

Just then, I spotted Natalie lingering near the back.

"Look who decided to show up," I murmured, tilting my chin toward the kitchen. Sebastian followed my gaze.

"Surprised she still works here," he muttered, his brow furrowing.

"Why?" Sophia leaned in, eyes sparkling with curiosity.

"Last time we were here, she plopped right next to Sebastian without recognizing me. Started running her mouth before I politely introduced myself." I slid my free hand over the one already resting on Sebastian's, squeezing lightly.

"Oh, I wish I'd seen that!" Sophia laughed, clapping her hands. "That must've been priceless."

"It was. Though honestly, I was used to people questioning why I was even with Sebastian in the first place."

"For the record," Oliver whispered conspiratorially, "I was always Team Evelyn."

"Wait, there were sides?" I blinked.

"Yours and Isabella's."

"Oh. Right. Forgot about her." I nodded, then sighed. "Speaking of which, I’m bummed the bar’s closed. I could really use some dancing tonight."

"Ugh, I can’t drink, can I?" Sophia pouted just as Gabriella returned with our drinks.

"Here you go! Appetizers will be out shortly. Ready to order?" She glanced around expectantly.

"What are you getting?" Sebastian turned to me.

"My usual. The pulled—"

"Pulled pork, no bun, with fried okra?" Gabriella finished smoothly.

"Damn, you're good." I grinned.

"I like to think so." She winked before shifting her attention. "And for you, Mr. Sebastian?"

"Brisket with cheesy potatoes and baked beans."

"Got it. And for you, ma'am?" She turned to Sophia.

"I'll take today's special." A half-slab of ribs with fries.

"Perfect. And you, sir?"

"Same as Evelyn, but with the bun, plus cheesy potatoes and beans."

"Excellent. I’ll get these started." Gabriella collected our menus and disappeared again.

"I like her," Sophia declared.

"Love her. She’s incredible at her job."

"So," Sophia clapped her hands together, "are we still hitting the pool this afternoon?"

"We can. Unless you two want some alone time?" I glanced between her and Oliver. "Big news and all. We’d understand."

"Are you kidding? We haven’t hung out in ages! I need this pool day." Sophia’s excitement was infectious.

"Then pool day it is." I chuckled. There was something deeply satisfying about making a pregnant woman happy. Sebastian looked mildly exasperated but kept it to himself.

"So, what’s the plan for the week? Only thing I know for sure is the school test on Thursday."

"Well," Sophia sighed, "apparently, I need help finalizing the pool design. We got approval, but the plans aren’t done."

"I’ll help tomorrow," I offered just as our appetizers arrived. Sophia immediately grabbed a pickle—and yelped, fanning her mouth.

"Hot! So hot!" She gulped half her iced tea while Gabriella rushed back, alarmed.

"Oh no! Are you okay?"

"Fine! Just—wow—spicy. But so good." Sophia grinned sheepishly.

Gabriella relaxed. "Here, try dipping them in ranch. Cools them right down."

"Bless you," Sophia said fervently, blowing on her next pickle like it was a sacred ritual.

"Never come between a pregnant woman and her food," I muttered, carefully nibbling mine. Oliver and Sebastian demolished the poppers.

"These are insane," Oliver said around a mouthful.

###Chapter 0175

"You all certainly know how to make an entrance," I teased, raising an eyebrow at their nervous energy.

Oliver glanced at Sophia, who looked like she was about to bolt. "There's something we need to discuss with you," he said carefully.

"Here? Now?" Sophia whispered, her fingers twisting the edge of her napkin.

Oliver gave her a reassuring squeeze on the shoulder. "It's fine."

I studied them both, curiosity prickling. "What's going on?"

"Sophia and I were thinking—" Oliver began, but before he could finish, Gabriella appeared with our food.

"Pulled pork, no bun," she said, setting my plate down. "Ribs for the lady, pork with bun for you, sir, and brisket." She placed the dishes in front of us with practiced ease. "Anything else I can get you?"

"We're good, thanks," I said, already reaching for my fork.

Sebastian and I didn’t press them further. Instead, we dug into our meals while Oliver and Sophia exchanged silent, anxious looks. Every so often, Sophia would open her mouth as if to speak, then shake her head and take another bite.

Honestly, it was kind of adorable how much she was struggling.

I finished first, leaning back to watch the others. Outside the window, two black SUVs rolled up. I nudged Sebastian’s leg, and his gaze followed mine as Dominic and his crew climbed out.

"Sophia, you done eating?" I asked.

"Almost—"

"Let me rephrase. You’re done. We need to go. Now."

Oliver tensed as Sebastian tossed a hundred on the table. Just as Dominic stepped inside, scanning the room before locking onto us. My back was to him, but I could feel his stare like ice down my spine.

"Well, isn’t this a delightful coincidence?" His voice made my skin crawl.

"Coincidence, sure," Sebastian said smoothly, resting a protective hand on my thigh. "We were just leaving."

"Pity. I should’ve arrived sooner." Dominic’s smirk was razor-thin. "Ms. Evelyn, I hear your shop’s nearly finished its remodel?"

"It is. Still a few finishing touches, but honestly? I’m grateful for the vandalism. The upgrades are chef’s kiss."

His jaw twitched, but he kept his composure. "Glad something good came from it. I’d still like to book a session."

"Afraid I’m backlogged. Previous clients first—you understand."

His smile didn’t reach his eyes. "I’ll wait for your call, then."

Gabriella hovered nearby, clearly waiting to seat him. "If you’ll excuse us," I said firmly.

Dominic glanced at her, then back at me. "Saturday, then. Save me a dance."

Sebastian and Oliver maneuvered us out while Gabriella led Dominic away. The second we hit the sidewalk, I pulled Sebastian aside.

"He’s going to send rogues after us. We can’t risk Sophia. Alternate route?"

Sebastian nodded, already moving toward the bikes. "Oliver, Sophia—stick close. Watch for rogues."

We mounted up, helmets on, and Sebastian veered onto a side street. It’d take us out of the way, but if it kept Sophia safe—

"What’s that?" Sophia shouted.

The roar of engines echoed behind us.

Too late.

###Chapter 0176

"Keep moving. Don't stop." I urged as we sped down the road. Even with the detour, we made it back in two hours. No rogue attacks, but the tension had left us all on edge.

"Why don't you two go change and meet us in the office?" Oliver pressed a k*ss to Sophia’s forehead.

"Okay," Sophia murmured before darting up the stairs.

"Make sure you send warriors to scout the route. We need it cleared for humans," I told Sebastian.

"Already on it," he nodded, disappearing into his office.

As I headed toward the bedroom, I heard soft sobs.

Rounding the corner slowly, I found Sophia sitting on the floor, tears streaking her cheeks.

"Sophia? What's wrong?" I knelt beside her.

"I'm sorry," she sniffled. "I used to be so strong, so in control. Now I don’t even recognize myself."

"Sweetheart, you're pregnant. It’s okay. This happens." I gripped her shoulders, helping her stand before guiding her to her room. She opened the door, and we made our way to the bed.

"I hate that I can’t be the person you need right now."

"I don’t need you to be anyone but yourself. Your baby is what matters. Stress isn’t good for either of you. Maybe you should take a few days off?"

"You’d really be okay with that?" She blinked at me, confused.

"Why wouldn’t I be?"

"Oliver thought we all had to be present, but we were hoping..." She trailed off.

"Just say it," I encouraged with a smile.

"That I could switch to part-time? Between the baby, my hormones, and all this stress..." She shook her head. "I need to get myself together."

"I agree. Take the time you need. We’ll still need Oliver, but you can rest. Hell, work from bed if you want. Just focus on staying healthy."

"I love you," Sophia whispered, wiping her eyes before throwing her arms around me.

"I love you too. You’re like a sister to me. I’d do anything for you."

"Then will you wear the pink bikini?" she teased.

"You’re hilarious." I laughed, pulling away. I went to her closet and grabbed the tiniest swimsuit she owned. "Here. Wear this. I’ll change and come back for you."

"Okay, I’ll be here."

Leaving her room, I climbed the stairs to mine just as Sebastian walked in.

"Hey," I said, jumping up behind him.

"Why are you just getting here?" He shut the door behind me.

"Sophia had a breakdown. She asked if she could cut back to part-time." I grabbed my black swimsuit from the closet.

"And you said?" He pulled off his shirt.

"That it was fine, but we still need Oliver. If she wants to work from bed, she can."

Sebastian nodded, pulling out his swim trunks. "I agree."

"Any news on the rogues?" I asked, stripping down to change.

"Not yet. Still searching."

I frowned. "Do you think I overreacted?"

"Not even close." He grabbed two beach towels as I slipped on my cover-up.

"Good." Sebastian swatted my a*s as I slid into my flip-flops.

"Ready?" I asked.

"Let’s go." He opened the door for me.

We headed back to Oliver and Sophia’s room. She answered with a smile when I knocked.

"Hey, ready?"

"We are."

"I had the carts brought around," Sebastian said as they stepped out.

"Perfect." Oliver took Sophia’s hand, and we descended the stairs to the waiting golf cart.

Sebastian took the wheel, driving us through the woods to the secluded pond we’d visited before.

###Chapter 0177

"And that, Sophia, is how you're supposed to drive," I teased as we climbed out of the car. She stuck her tongue out at me, making me laugh as I tossed my towel onto a nearby chair. Slipping off my cover-up and flip-flops, I dove straight into the cool water.

A splash sounded beside me. As I surfaced, two more followed. "This feels incredible," I said, swimming over to Sebastian. He caught my hand and pulled me tightly against him.

"It really does," Sophia agreed, clinging to Oliver. "Scarlett, I've been meaning to ask—how are Grayson and Audrey doing?"

My body stiffened against Sebastian. He immediately began rubbing slow circles on my back as I turned to face Sophia. I noticed Oliver’s sharp gaze, but thankfully, he stayed silent. "They're doing great. Audrey had a bit of a rough transition, but you know how that goes. She’s handling it well now."

"Yeah, it’s not easy," Sophia said, completely unaware of my half-truth. Oliver, however, wasn’t fooled. Still, he didn’t call me out—maybe because Sebastian had mind-linked him, or maybe because he knew better. Either way, I was relieved.

"Definitely. I’m so excited for prom, though. My dress is killer," I said, quickly changing the subject. Sebastian pressed a kiss to my cheek, holding me like I was something precious. His hands roamed freely while I stayed still, enjoying the contact. Oliver mirrored the gesture with Sophia.

"Me too. I can’t wait to dance. It’s been forever," Sophia sighed.

"Hopefully things calm down soon—" Sebastian’s phone rang, cutting him off. He released me, swimming to the edge to answer it.

"Hello?" He listened for a moment before responding. "Got it."

"What happened?" I asked as he slipped back into the water. He cupped my face, pulling me close.

"You were right. They found about a dozen rogues. Two are still alive and being brought to the cells. You saved a lot of lives today, Scarlett. Including ours." He kissed me hard, and I melted into him.

"That’s insane," Sophia breathed, stunned. "To think what could’ve happened…"

"Don’t," Oliver cut in, turning her toward him. "Don’t go there."

They drifted to their own corner of the pond, and we did the same. Though we could still see each other, we pretended not to.

"Sebastian… I can’t believe that actually happened," I murmured, searching his eyes.

"I’m proud of you for trusting your instincts."

"Thank you. I just… I want this week to be over. But I have a feeling it’s only the beginning." I rested my head against his chest, seeking comfort.

"I’ll always keep you safe," he promised, holding me tight before tilting my chin up for a kiss. It started soft but quickly deepened. From the other side of the pond, soft moans reached our ears.

My hand slid down, wrapping around his length. He was already hard, and I stroked him slowly. Sebastian slipped two fingers inside me as our kiss grew more desperate. I bit back a moan as he worked me expertly. Pushing his swim trunks down, I guided him into me, gasping as he filled me completely.

This wasn’t just sex—it was a desperate affirmation. We needed each other. Another brush with death, another reminder of how fragile life was. This was different. This was saying, We’re still here. We’re alive. We love each other.

He moved slowly, deliberately, our eyes locked as he thrust in and out. Too soon, pleasure crashed over us, our bodies shuddering together. He came deep inside me, his breath hot against my neck.

"At this rate, protection won’t matter if you don’t start pulling out," I whispered in his ear.

"Sorry," he murmured, still buried inside me. "I can’t help it. You feel too damn good."

###Chapter 0178

"Is that why you're still inside me?" I giggled, tracing circles on his chest.

"Total accident," Sebastian murmured, his lips brushing my temple.

"Liar," I teased, nipping at his earlobe.

"I can't wait to watch you move on the dance floor."

"If I make it there," I countered, smirking.

His brows furrowed. "What do you mean?"

"After you see my dress, you might not let me leave."

"Is that so?" Sebastian's gaze darkened as he studied me.

"Absolutely."

His grip tightened. "Then I'll just tear it off you right here. We won't make it to prom because you won't have a dress left."

I leaned in, my breath hot against his ear. "Good thing I'm not wearing anything underneath. You can have me before, during, and after." His growl vibrated through me as I felt him harden again, my body clenching around him.

The shrill ring of his phone shattered the moment. He hesitated, torn between answering and ignoring it.

"Go," I sighed, reluctantly pulling away. "It might be important."

Sebastian groaned as he withdrew, adjusting his pants. Even as he stepped out of the water, his arousal was evident. I admired the way droplets traced the contours of his muscles, his tattoo—a wolf so lifelike it seemed to watch me. Every flex made the beast appear to move.

"Time to go," he commanded, his voice sharp with authority.

Oliver, still breathless, frowned. "What's wrong?"

"They found something on the phone."

"I thought they traced it to a building in the city?" Oliver swam toward the edge.

"They did. But there's more now." Sebastian snatched a towel, drying off briskly. Oliver and Sophia climbed out first, then I followed. Sebastian handed me my towel, gathering our things. He tossed me my shoes and carried my cover-up to the cart, his entire demeanor tense.

What aren’t you telling us? I pressed through the mind-link.

Pictures.

Of what?

Us. That night in the shop. And from yesterday.

My stomach dropped. We were in the cart now, Sebastian driving with white-knuckled fury. I whipped my head toward him.

"You mean—someone's been following me? Taking pictures inside my own pack?" My voice trembled.

Sebastian didn’t answer, but the steering wheel groaned under his grip. Rage rolled off him in waves as we reached the packhouse.

Oliver immediately tensed, his protective instincts flaring. "Sophia, go shower in our room."

She hesitated, glancing between us. "Scarlett?"

"Please," I begged. "I'll explain later."

Her jaw tightened, but she nodded, pressing a hand to her stomach before leaving.

We stormed into Alpha Benjamin's office.

"What the hell?" Sebastian slammed the door open.

Alpha Benjamin gestured to his computer, standing aside—thankfully not looking at the screen. I followed Sebastian, watching as he clicked through the images. There we were—in my shop, in front of the mirror. Then outside the ruined store. And later, walking near the packhouse.

"Go back," I ordered.

The next image froze my blood.

Me, lounging by the pool with Sophia.

Taken from above.

"Next one," I whispered.

###Chapter 0179

The photograph showed Sebastian and me strolling together. "That was right outside the packhouse. Remember? We took an impromptu walk," Sebastian murmured. I recalled it vividly—just a brief escape for fresh air after watching that movie. Grayson had made me sign the will earlier, and I'd wanted to clear my head before bed.

"The angle is from above. All these photos are taken that way," I pointed out to the group.

"And zoomed in?" Alpha Benjamin questioned.

"There aren’t any buildings tall enough to capture that perspective for some of these shots. Like the one of me by the pool—no structure nearby could’ve taken that."

Sebastian’s jaw clenched, his voice tight with barely restrained fury. "What are you suggesting?"

"A drone, maybe. This could be a screenshot."

"A drone can be controlled from miles away!" Sebastian nearly shouted. I placed a hand on his shoulder, trying to steady him.

"Meaning it doesn’t have to be someone from our pack. It could be someone hiding just beyond our territory."

Sebastian whirled toward his father. "How did you get these?"

"They were pulled from the phone. This device didn’t take them, but someone sent them here. It was encrypted, but we cracked it."

"Did you find anything else?" I pressed.

"The phone is linked to that business. The sender’s number traces back to the same place," Alpha Benjamin said, crossing his arms.

Sebastian shot to his feet so violently that the chair sent me stumbling backward. The desk and Alpha Benjamin caught me before I hit the ground. But Sebastian? He snatched the chair and hurled it straight through the closed window.

"SEBASTIAN!" Alpha Benjamin roared.

"I’ve got him," I said quickly, grabbing Sebastian’s hand and dragging him out of the office. We stormed up to our bedroom, his entire body trembling with rage. The moment we entered, he began tearing through the room—flipping the couch, launching the armchair onto the balcony, upending the dresser.

"HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO PROTECT YOU WHEN THE SKY IS WATCHING YOU?" His control was unraveling. I let him vent until he smashed one of my framed drawings against the wall.

"ENOUGH!" I shouted.

Sebastian leaned against the wall, chest heaving, knuckles white. His eyes burned with fury.

"Do you feel better now that our room is destroyed?"

"No."

"Then let me think. We’ll figure this out." I didn’t reach for him, giving him space.

"F*CK!" he snarled as the door swung open. Oliver stepped in, scanning the wreckage before checking me for injuries. His gaze then locked onto Sebastian.

"Missed a spot," Oliver remarked dryly, perching on the edge of the bed.

"Piss off, Oliver," Sebastian snapped, pacing like a caged animal.

"We’ll—" I started.

"WHAT’S THE PLAN, THEN?" Sebastian whirled on me, his temper boiling over.

"Maybe you need to run. Let your wolf out. Go kill something," Oliver suggested, moving protectively closer to me.

"Come on. I’ll go with you." Oliver grabbed Sebastian’s arm, but Sebastian ripped free and bolted for the balcony.

"NO!" I screamed as he leaped off, shifting midair. He landed in wolf form and vanished into the trees.

"You’d better follow him, Oliver," I said quietly.

A second later, the bedroom door slammed against the wall again. I sprinted to Alpha Benjamin’s office, barging in without knocking—only to find it empty. With no one to mind-link, I raced straight to Sophia’s room and kicked the door open.

###Chapter 0180

"What in the world?" Sophia shot upright from her bed, her heart pounding.

"Mind-link Alpha Benjamin. Tell him I need him immediately. It's urgent." Without hesitation, Sophia closed her eyes and relayed my message.

"He's in the kitchen." I didn't wait for explanations before sprinting downstairs, nearly colliding with Benjamin in the hallway.

"You need to issue an emergency lockdown. Sebastian hasn't calmed down yet - his wolf broke free. Oliver went after him but no one should be outside right now. Mobilize the warriors."

"Damn it. He hasn't lost control like this in years." Benjamin stormed toward his office. "We'll need to track him. Your wolf will have to find him if Oliver hasn't already."

"I can't bloody mind-link anyone, and Sebastian's blocking me!"

"Then denounce your ties. Now." Benjamin's chest expanded with authority, catching me completely off guard. It took me a full minute to gather myself.

A searing pain tore through my chest, but I knew it was necessary. "I, Evelyn Andrews, future Luna of the Silvercrest Pack, hereby denounce all ties to the Crimson Fang Pack." The words felt like a blade twisting in my gut, forcing me to double over. Tears welled but I kept repeating - this was for Sebastian.

"I, Benjamin Blackwood, Alpha of Silvercrest Pack, accept Evelyn Andrews as a member of my pack and as our future Luna." His voice boomed through the hall.

"I, Evelyn Andrews, accept my position as member of Silvercrest Pack and as their future Luna."

Suddenly, a tidal wave of voices crashed into my skull. Hundreds of unfamiliar pack bonds assaulted my mind, overwhelming every thought.

"Good. Move out." Benjamin grabbed my arm, dragging me forward as white spots danced in my vision.

"Shift." His bones cracked before the command fully registered.

"Luna!" I screamed internally through the mental chaos. My wolf surged forward, shoving my human consciousness aside as she took control. The shift happened in fragments - flashes of warriors scattering, Benjamin slowing his pace, then...

Sebastian's wolf. Hackles raised, teeth bared, completely feral.

"Sebastian." I mind-linked through the storm.

"Why are you hurting?" His voice came through clenched jaws, rage barely contained.

"I severed my old bonds. The new ones are... loud. You need to calm down." Through the mental fog, I saw Luna padding forward, placing herself between Benjamin and Sebastian's snarling wolf. Even enraged, he recognized his mate - the only one who could approach him now.

"You did what?" His wolf locked eyes with Luna, expression unreadable. "How are you still conscious?"

"You needed me." Each word was a battle against the pain.

"You shouldn't have done this."

"Sebastian! You leapt through a damn window! I couldn't reach anyone, couldn't mind-link until just now. I had to find Sophia to contact your father because his office was empty!"

"All this... for me?"

"Please. Calm down. Send everyone away." The world tilted dangerously. I just wanted to shift back and surrender to the darkness creeping at the edges of my vision.

A bone-chilling howl erupted from Sebastian's wolf as his posture shifted. Moments later, human Sebastian stood before us. "I'm stable. Everyone disperse." He knelt beside Luna, who'd collapsed whimpering to the ground.

"Is she alright?" Oliver's voice cut through the murmurs.

"She severed her old pack bonds. The transition is... brutal. She needs to rest but refused to yield until I was calm. Clear the area so she can shift back."

"You heard your Alpha! Give your Luna privacy!" Footsteps retreated as Sebastian crouched beside me. Though anger still radiated from him, the crisis had passed.

###Chapter 0181

"You can shift back now. I brought clothes for you." Sebastian's voice was gentle as he coaxed me.

Luna retreated into my mind, sparing me from the lingering pain. The moment I shifted, dry dirt tickled my nose, making me sneeze.

"Ow." I winced as Sebastian draped a shirt over me and tugged on a pair of shorts.

"I'm so sorry," he murmured, guilt lacing his words. "I can't believe you did this without me. You knew how much it would hurt. It kills me that I'm the reason this happened."

"Your dad surprised me with it," I muttered, my vision swimming with black spots. "Can I sleep now?"

"Yes, my love. Rest." His lips brushed my forehead before darkness swallowed me whole.

Sebastian's POV

I sank to the ground beside my unconscious mate, my wolf still simmering with rage. It had taken over completely—until he saw Evelyn. Only then did the fury begin to ebb, replaced by crushing guilt when he realized the pain she was in.

How many times had her inability to mind-link become a problem? And the fact that my father had forced her to endure this alone? Unforgivable.

Oliver had left his phone with me before taking off. I needed to call Grayson. He was our strongest ally right now, even if I hated burdening him further.

I found Grayson’s number and dialed. He answered on the second ring.

"Oliver?"

"No, it's me," I sighed.

"Sebastian?" His voice sharpened instantly. "What's wrong? Where's your phone?"

"Probably shattered somewhere. Listen—this isn’t good news."

"Is Evelyn okay?"

"Yeah, she’s fine." I stood, pacing restlessly. "What’s going on?"

"We finally cracked the phone."

A beat of silence. Then—"And?"

"And it’s bad. The phone’s linked to that same building in the city, but worse—there are photos from just days ago, taken from my territory."

"WHAT?" Grayson roared.

"Evelyn thinks they were taken from a distance, high up. Probably a drone. They’ve been flying over, recording, then sending screenshots to the phone."

"Why send them to the phone?" His voice was pure fury.

"To identify her," I admitted, the words tasting like failure.

"What’s the plan?"

"We don’t have one yet. I lost control—just barely calmed down."

"That’s why she denounced her ties?"

"Yeah. Not being able to mind-link has screwed us more than once."

"She’s out cold now?"

"Completely."

"How the hell do we stop a damn drone?"

"No clue. Evelyn thinks they need to be within a mile or two to operate. Send scouts. Find whoever’s controlling it—shoot it down."

"She won’t stay inside. We’ve already taken her shop. The bar’s not opening until this is over." Grayson was thinking aloud.

Dusk was falling. This was going to be a long damn week.

A faint buzzing caught my attention. I looked up—a small bee darted around my head before exploding right in front of my face.

"What the—?" Smoke curled into my nostrils.

"Sebastian?"

"Grayson—hell—" The world spun violently before everything went black.

###Chapter 0182
Evelyn POV

"Wake up, sweetheart."

Ice-cold water splashed across my face, shocking me into consciousness. My stomach churned violently, threatening to expel everything inside. A sharp, throbbing pain radiated from my shoulder and ankles, and my head pounded as if it might split open.

Why had Sebastian abandoned me in the woods?

"Sebastian?" I groaned, my mouth flooding with bitter saliva.

"Oh no, darling. Someone much better."

That voice—the one I prayed I'd never hear again—sent a wave of dread through me. My body tensed before I even forced my eyes open. The world spun violently, and I lost the battle with my stomach, heaving to the side as it emptied itself.

"Ah, that’s normal. Just a little side effect," the voice taunted.

"Side effect… of what?" I gasped between dry heaves.

"If I told you, I’d have to kill you." Dominic chuckled darkly.

I focused on steadying my breathing, trying to regain control before daring to open my eyes fully. My head felt like lead as I rolled it weakly from side to side. I was upright, tied to a chair—wrists bound, ankles secured—but at least I still had my clothes.

Then, rough fingers gripped my chin, forcing my face up before cold lips crushed against mine. I recoiled, but he forced his tongue into my mouth. Panic surged through me—my worst nightmare was unfolding. The moment his tongue touched mine, I bit down as hard as I could.

A sharp cry escaped him as he jerked away. Blood dripped from my split lip and a fresh cut above my eye.

"You stupid bitch!" Dominic roared, clutching his bleeding mouth. His eyes burned with fury and something far more sinister. "I’ll enjoy breaking that defiance out of you. You will submit."

He took a threatening step forward—

"DOMINIC!"

The command froze him in place, though his glare never left me.

"My apologies for my son," a deeper voice drawled. "He lacks patience."

Alpha Damian stepped into view—an older, balder version of Dominic. Fear coiled in my chest, but I refused to let it show.

"Lacks patience?" I spat blood onto the floor.

"I do admire your spirit," Damian mused, moving closer.

"What do you want from me?" My voice stayed steady, despite the terror clawing at my insides.

"Me? Nothing. But my son here would like you to reject Sebastian and accept him as your mate."

"I’d rather die."

Damian’s lips curled into a cruel smile. "We’ll see about that." He clapped Dominic on the shoulder, and they strode out. The heavy metal door slammed shut, followed by the unmistakable sound of locks clicking into place.

"Damn it," I whispered.

I took in my surroundings—a massive, abandoned warehouse. A rusted ceiling fan creaked above me, casting faint, flickering light. Dust coated every surface, and grime obscured the windows. Chains dangled ominously from the ceiling, and a drain sat beneath my chair.

No shelves. No exits. Just me, this chair, and the rats already emerging from the shadows.

Time blurred. Darkness swallowed the room. My stomach still churned, my bladder ached, and exhaustion weighed down my limbs. The chair wasn’t bolted down, but tipping it over would only make me easier prey for the rats.

And with my ankles bound, escape was impossible.

I wasn’t leaving here unharmed.

###Chapter 0183

The chair wouldn't budge no matter how hard I tried to scoot it across the filthy concrete floor. The back leg kept catching on the rusted drain, threatening to tip me over if I pushed any harder.

I reached out through the mind-link—silence.

I called for Luna—nothing.

Wolfsbane. That damn poison coursed through my veins, rendering me powerless. Whoever had concocted this hellish brew deserved to rot.

Exhaustion dragged me under again.

The screech of metal jolted me awake. Lifting my head sent white-hot agony shooting down my spine.

A small girl shuffled in, barely twelve, her thin frame swallowed by a tattered sack of a dress. Bruises mottled her arms. Behind her loomed a hulking guard, gun in hand.

"I-I brought food," she stammered. "And I'll let you pee. But if you run..." She glanced at the guard. "He'll shoot us both."

I stayed silent as she unlocked the chains. The moment my limbs were free, I collapsed onto the cold floor.

"F*ck," I groaned.

"Bathroom's here." She pointed to a dark corner.

My first attempt to stand sent me crashing onto my hands and knees. My arms gave out, and my face hit the dirt.

The second time, I managed to get my feet under me—barely. The girl rushed back, helping me limp toward the foul-smelling hole in the wall that passed for a toilet.

No door. No dignity.

Spiders clung to webs above the seat. Rat droppings littered the floor. I hovered as best I could, relief flooding me when I finally emptied my bladder.

"HURRY UP!" the guard barked mid-stream.

Like I could stop now.

I was yanking up my shorts when he stormed in.

"Done," I spat.

His backhand sent my skull cracking against the wall. The world spun as I crumpled.

Darkness swallowed me whole.

Voices swam through the fog in my head.

"—the hell happened to her?"

Grunts. Muffled curses.

A hand shook my shoulder. "Wake up."

Alpha Damian's voice dragged me back.

I pried open one swollen eye—and froze.

I was back in the chair. How?

The girl knelt before me, trembling, a fresh bruise blooming on her cheek. The guard stood off to the side, nose gushing blood.

"Who touched you?" Damian demanded.

I glared at the guard. "That piece of sh*t."

Dominic didn't hesitate. He raised his gun—

BANG.

The guard dropped. Dead.

The girl stifled a whimper.

"What now?" Dominic asked.

"Stick to the plan," Damian said, setting up equipment.

"With her face like that?"

Damian waved him off. "It's fine."

Apparently, my battered face wasn't part of their grand scheme.

###Chapter 0184

"This won't end well. Without her wolf, the healing process will be painfully slow."

"Fine. We'll administer the serum and postpone until tomorrow." Alpha Damian sighed impatiently. "Did you bring it?"

"Actually... no."

"Then go fucking get it!" Damian's roar shook the walls. Dominic stormed out, tires screeching as he sped away. "Consider this mercy. I need you somewhat presentable for the recording."

"Why?"

"Buyers pay top dollar for pretty merchandise. Though you'll never see home again." His grin turned predatory. "I've prepared a special room where you'll keep my son company."

Bile surged up my throat before I could process his words. Just the thought of his hands on me made my body tremble violently. The revving engine outside sent fresh panic coursing through me.

Dominic returned, tossing a vial to the cowering girl. "Make her drink it."

"What is it?" I demanded.

"Healing elixir. Unless you want your face looking like raw meat." He smirked, arms crossed.

"And if I refuse?"

Dominic pressed his gun to the girl's temple. Her pleading eyes locked onto mine.

The bitter liquid burned like ice down my throat. I gagged—my stomach hadn't held anything in days.

"Change of plans." Damian stood abruptly. "We're filming now."

Dominic scowled. "Then why—"

"Silence!" Damian shoved his son aside. "Listen carefully, little rabbit. You'll recite my script perfectly. Every mistake earns her a bullet in the foot." He gestured to the trembling girl. "We'll restart until you get it right."

My pulse hammered. "What do you want me to say?"

Damian hesitated. "You were supposed to claim you left willingly, but..." He studied my swollen eye. "Maybe we skip the theatrics."

"What's the point if I'm not leaving alive?" The serum churned in my gut like liquid fire.

"True enough." Damian's smile turned feral. "Perhaps breaking you first will be more entertaining. Everyone cracks eventually."

The girl whimpered as Dominic's laughter filled the room.

###Chapter 0185

Time blurred into an indistinguishable haze. Since Alpha Theodore and Dominic had stormed out of the room, I hadn’t seen either of them. Twice, darkness swallowed the world, and twice, dawn broke—but I was so disoriented I couldn’t tell if I was awake or trapped in a nightmare.

Then, unexpectedly, my vision cleared. Both eyes focused just in time to see lightning split the sky outside the barred window. Thunder growled, and the scent of rain seeped through the cracks in the walls.

"Good evening, gorgeous." Dominic's voice slithered through the dark, making me jolt. I hadn’t heard any vehicles—maybe the storm drowned them out. But he was bone-dry, so he must have arrived in one.

"What do you want?" I rasped, struggling to focus. My pulse skyrocketed as his shadow loomed closer, his presence suffocating.

"I brought you a present." His grin was venomous as he straddled the chair beneath me, his fingers digging into my skin as he forced my chin up.

"Get off!" My shout was weak, but he only laughed, pressing his lips to mine—this time without the invasive tongue.

"God, I can’t wait to ruin you." He released me with a shove, and tears burned my eyes. My entire body trembled, but I clenched my fists, refusing to let him see my fear.

The door creaked open again. Three warriors dragged in an unconscious figure, dumping him carelessly onto the floor. The dim lantern light barely illuminated the scene, but when they hauled him upright and tied him to the chair opposite me, my breath stopped.

"No." The word was a whisper, a prayer.

Sebastian.

Blood streaked his face, his clothes torn and filthy.

"Oh, yes." Dominic gloated, circling us like a predator. "My men tracked him down. Brought him right to me."

"Your men?" I choked out. Desperately, I tried to reach him through the mind-link, but the connection was dead.

"That’s right, sweetheart. I’m the one in control now."

"Sebastian?" I whispered. His head hung limp, unmoving.

"He’ll wake up soon. But first—" Dominic smirked, backing toward the door. "We’ll be back."

The moment the door slammed shut, I strained my ears. No engines. No footsteps. Just the relentless drum of rain.

An hour crawled by.

Then, a groan.

"Sebastian!" My voice cracked.

His head lifted slowly, and despite the blood, his lips curled into a smirk. "Damn. It worked."

"What worked?"

"I had a feeling Dominic took you. And I knew he’d want you to reject me—which meant he’d bring me to you." His voice was rough but steady.

"How does that help?"

"I swallowed a tracker before I left."

A spark of hope flared in my chest. "So… help is coming?"

"Yes, Evelyn. Hold on." His gaze locked onto mine. "Are you hurt?"

The tears came then, hot and unstoppable. "No," I lied.

The door burst open.

"How touching." Dominic’s voice dripped with mockery as he strode in. "The star-crossed lovers reunited."

Sebastian’s whisper was barely audible. "Stay strong."

Dominic’s fingers wrapped around my throat from behind, squeezing just enough to make my vision blur. "Isn’t she perfect?"

"Let her go!" Sebastian snarled.

Dominic released me only to grab my face, his grip bruising. "Maybe I should remind her who she belongs to." His hand slid under my shirt—

I reacted on instinct.

I slammed my forehead into his nose.

"YOU BITCH!" He reeled back, then struck me across the face so hard my ears rang.

"DON’T TOUCH HER!" Sebastian roared.

Dominic spun and drove his fist into Sebastian’s stomach. He retched, and something metallic clattered to the floor.

Dominic bent, picking it up. His smirk vanished.

"You’ve got about thirty seconds," Sebastian rasped, blood staining his teeth, "before this place is swarming with my pack."

Dominic’s face went pale.

###Chapter 0186

Dominic sprinted to the window before turning back to me. His voice was a venomous whisper. "This isn't over, Evelyn. I'll be waiting. The moment you let your guard down, I'll take you." Then he vanished from the building.

He wasn't wrong.

Seconds later, flash bombs exploded, blinding me. Men in tactical gear stormed in from multiple directions. My vision blurred, but my gaze locked onto Sebastian. The adrenaline crash hit hard, and my chains rattled violently, making me flinch.

"Don't touch her!" Sebastian's command cut through the chaos.

Everything froze as someone knelt before me.

"Luna. It's Oliver. Can I unlock these?" My eyes were too clouded with tears to see him clearly.

"Unlock me first," Sebastian growled.

Oliver hesitated but obeyed, moving to Sebastian's restraints. I blinked rapidly, forcing the tears away.

"Alpha—"

"I'm fine," Sebastian snapped. "Evelyn, I'm going to free you."

The chains loosened, but my shoulders remained dislocated.

"Sebastian, her shoulders are out," Oliver murmured, though his voice carried in the silent room.

"Damn it," Sebastian muttered as the chains fell away, but my arms stayed limp. "This is going to hurt."

"Do them both at once," I said, my voice steadier than I felt.

Sebastian frowned. "What?"

"Snap them back together. Now." My tears had dried, replaced by cold fury.

Oliver hesitated. "Luna, are you—"

"Do it." My glare silenced him.

With a grim nod, he positioned himself. "I need to touch you."

Sebastian and Oliver each gripped one shoulder.

"One. Two—"

SNAP.

A scream tore from my throat as sensation flooded back into my arms. They carefully wrapped my injuries, securing them against my body.

"Anything else?" Sebastian asked.

"No," I lied, my vision swimming.

"Don't fight it. Just pass out," Oliver urged.

"Not until I'm home."

"Evelyn, you need—"

"No!" I snarled. "Last time I passed out, I woke up here. I'm not closing my eyes until I'm safe."

Sebastian tried to stand but collapsed with a pained hiss. "Broke a rib." He gritted his teeth and forced himself up, then helped me to my feet.

"Where's Grayson?" I asked.

"Guarding the pack," Oliver answered.

"How did you convince him to stay?"

"It wasn't easy."

Cold rain slapped my face as we stepped outside. Wind whipped my hair, but the sight of our armored vehicles and armed warriors was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. My body trembled—not from cold, but from the aftermath of hell.

"What day is it?" I asked as Oliver opened the car door.

"Thursday."

Sebastian helped me inside before sliding in beside me. Oliver took the passenger seat while another warrior took the wheel.

"Is it ready?" Sebastian asked.

"Waiting on your order," Oliver confirmed.

"Ready for what?" I demanded.

"This building—it's the same one linked to the phone trace. It's abandoned, so we're leveling it. And we’re moving up the garage demolition. We’re not waiting until Saturday."

The car peeled out, merging onto the interstate toward home.

Sebastian kept his arm around me despite his injuries. Grateful but guilty, I shifted. "Can I lie down?" My stomach churned violently.

He nodded, helping me stretch across the seat. My head rested on his thigh, legs curled up. His hand settled on my waist, anchoring me to him.

###Chapter 0187

"It's alright." I attempted to sit up but failed. Sebastian had to assist me as I shifted to the middle seat. His arms encircled me, his face buried in the crook of my neck for a brief moment before he pulled away.

"Whenever you're ready," Oliver said, pressing record on the tape recorder. Placing it on the center console, I could only stare at it blankly.

"I woke up chained to that chair. Essentially, Alpha Damian and Dominic kidnapped me. Dominic..." I shut my eyes, struggling to steady my voice as I recounted the events. "Anyway, they slapped me before leaving. I don’t know how much time passed before a guard came with a young girl. She looked about thirteen, dressed in nothing but a potato sack. She helped me use the bathroom, but when I took too long, the guard stormed in and beat me unconscious." Sebastian's fists clenched, his grip tightening on the seat. "When I came to, Alpha Damian and Dominic were there with the girl and the guard. After they learned what happened, Dominic shot the guard in the head."

"Good," Sebastian muttered darkly.

"I couldn’t see out of one eye. Alpha Damian was setting up what I think was a video camera. He wanted me to record a message. He said if I messed up or refused, he’d shoot the girl in the foot and keep going until I cooperated. But since my face was too swollen, they scrapped the plan."

"What was the video for?" Oliver asked quietly.

"He wanted me to say I was leaving you and not to come looking for me. Dominic suggested waiting and giving me something to help me heal. When he left to get it, Alpha Damian told me they had a secret room where I’d live as Dominic’s... plaything. He said I’d never escape—that would be my life." The driver’s knuckles whitened around the steering wheel.

"I’m sorry, but we need to know..." Oliver hesitated, then met my gaze. "Did... did he touch you?"

"Nothing below the waist," I finally admitted, struggling to find the right words. Shame burned through me as I avoided Sebastian’s eyes, fighting back tears.

"Hey." Sebastian gently tilted my chin up as Oliver stopped the recording. "Look at me."

Reluctantly, I obeyed. "I’m so sorry I wasn’t strong enough to stop him."

"You have nothing to apologize for. He will pay for this." Sebastian pressed a kiss to my forehead before Oliver resumed the recording.

"Is there anything else?" he asked.

"I don’t think so. My face ruined their plans, so I don’t know what was supposed to happen next." Oliver nodded and turned off the recorder again.

"I’m sorry, Evelyn," Oliver murmured.

"What happened?" I ignored his apology. "How did I get kidnapped from the heart of our territory?"

"After you passed out, I called Grayson to explain what happened. Then some bee-like thing flew into my face and exploded. I inhaled the smoke and blacked out."

"He was on the phone with Grayson when it happened, so Grayson alerted the office. We rushed to him immediately. Thankfully, we got Sebastian medical attention, but it took hours before we realized you were missing. We assumed Sebastian had carried you to your room after you fainted. The security footage showed nothing. It wasn’t until Sebastian regained consciousness that we realized you’d been taken," Oliver explained.

"But how?"

###Chapter 0188

"Evelyn." Sebastian's voice was a low growl.

"What happened? How?"

"Remember when I sent Isabella to work in the cells? There's an underground escape tunnel we built. She let Dominic in through it to kidnap you, thinking I'd take her back."

"You're kidding me?" My mind reeled at the revelation.

"Obviously we sealed the tunnels permanently and secured Isabella. But we had no idea where to find you." Oliver continued explaining.

"I used myself as bait. It wasn't a popular decision, but I did it anyway." Sebastian's grip tightened around me. "I swallowed a tracker and let them capture me, hoping they'd take me to you so we could reject each other."

"I still don't understand why? He would have assaulted me regardless of whether we were mates or not."

"If you were mates, your body would respond to his even if your mind rejected it." Oliver answered for Sebastian. The thought made me press closer to Sebastian's protective embrace.

"Damn it." Oliver muttered under his breath.

"What now?" I braced myself for more bad news.

"It's Sophia calling again."

"Just answer it." I urged.

"Sophia, sweetheart, you—"

"Did you find Evelyn?" She cut him off mid-sentence.

Oliver glanced at me and I nodded. He held the phone to me. "Hey Soph. I'm safe."

"Oh thank God! You have no idea how relieved I am to hear your voice." Sophia's voice cracked with emotion.

"I'm really okay. You should get some rest. Come see me tomorrow, alright?"

"Okay, Grayson's here."

"Evelyn." His voice carried such profound relief it made my chest ache.

"Grayson." Neither of us said more. The silence between us spoke volumes.

"I'll see you soon." He finally said.

"Okay." I motioned for Oliver to end the call.

"That was... intense between you and Grayson."

"No it wasn't. He was just relieved I'm safe." Sebastian helped me lie back down.

"I'll never understand you two." Oliver mumbled, making me smile despite everything.

I must have dozed off because the next thing I knew, the SUV door was swinging open. Strong arms lifted me onto a gurney. My eyelids felt like lead weights, but I was acutely aware of blinding lights and unfamiliar hands touching me.

"NO!" I screamed, thrashing violently. All I could see was Dominic's leering face, his hands on me again.

"EVERYONE BACK OFF NOW!" Sebastian's command sliced through the chaos. Immediately, all contact ceased. "She was just kidnapped and..." His voice dropped dangerously low. "Don't you dare fucking touch her without permission."

"Sebastian." My voice came out as a whimper.

"Talk to me, sweetheart."

"The lights... they're too bright." I pressed my face against his chest. Seconds later, the harsh illumination dimmed and I could finally open my eyes. Sebastian stood beside me, medical staff in scrubs surrounded us, and then my gaze locked with Grayson's.

Our eyes held as my body began trembling uncontrollably. "Shh, it's alright. These are doctors. They need to check your shoulders and ankles. Are you hurt anywhere else?" Grayson asked gently.

"N-no." I managed to whisper.

"We'll step out and let—" Grayson started to say.

"NO!" Panic surged through me as I looked between him and Sebastian. "Please... stay with me?"

"We're not going anywhere." Sebastian leaned down, pressing a kiss to my forehead that instantly calmed my racing heart.

"No male doctors." I insisted, eyeing the medical team. Without argument, the male staff exited, leaving only female practitioners along with Grayson and Sebastian.

"Can they examine you now?" Sebastian asked softly.

Words failed me, so I simply nodded. Grayson moved to stand guard by the door while Sebastian positioned himself behind me. Two female medics approached, one on each side of the gurney.

###Chapter 0189

I gave a slow nod, wincing as Rebecca barely touched me while unwrapping the bandages. "We'll need to cut off your shirt," she said, holding up a pair of scissors.

Again, I nodded. They moved behind me, carefully slicing the fabric up to my neck and down each arm. But they didn’t just remove it—instead, they pressed against my back and sides, keeping the shirt covering my chest before tying it securely in the back.

I was grateful for that small mercy. Not because I cared if Grayson saw me exposed, but because I already felt too vulnerable as it was.

"We’re going to assess your shoulders, neck, and face now," Genevieve said as they began their examination.

"We’ll need X-rays of both shoulders and her face," Genevieve instructed Rebecca, who immediately went to the closet and retrieved the machine.

"What are you doing?" Sebastian demanded.

"X-rays to check for fractures," Genevieve explained. He gave a stiff nod in response. "But Luna Evelyn, we need you lying flat. Is that alright?"

I nodded again, shifting so I could rest fully against the bed. As they lowered me, Genevieve positioned the machine above me.

"This is the X-ray machine. A light will flash, and after a beep, we’ll be done with the first image," Rebecca explained.

They stepped back as the machine activated just as she’d described. My panic had begun to ebb slightly, thanks to the steady waves of calm Sebastian was pushing through our bond.

The first image was taken quickly, then they repositioned the machine over my other shoulder before finally moving it above my face. Gently tilting my head, I closed my eyes as the light flashed a third time.

"Her shoulders aren’t broken, but her jaw is fractured. It’s already setting correctly, so no need for intervention there. However, her shoulders need to be reset—they’re not fully aligned," one of the nurses informed us.

"Can you numb her first?" Grayson asked sharply.

"No. No numbing. I need to feel this," I said firmly.

"Are you sure?" Sebastian moved closer, his gaze locking onto mine.

"Yes."

He exhaled but nodded, climbing onto the bed to straddle me as the nurses positioned themselves at each arm.

"On the count of three," one of them said.

"No. Just do it." I clenched my jaw, bracing myself.

In one swift motion, they bent my arms before yanking them back into place. A sharp cry escaped me before I could stop it.

"They should feel better now," the nurse murmured as they began wrapping my shoulders in a skin-like bandage. My shirt had to be removed completely this time, leaving my arms pressed against my bare skin.

"It does," I admitted through gritted teeth.

"Would you like pain medication?" another nurse asked.

I still hadn’t opened my eyes. "Yes."

I heard her footsteps retreating. Sebastian kept his hands on my legs, his touch sending soothing sparks through me.

"Small pinch," the nurse warned.

It was never just a pinch—more like a damn hornet sting. But within seconds, the pain began to dull.

"You can take her home. Keep her in bed tomorrow. Her wolf should return by then, and healing will speed up," the other nurse said as she peeled off her gloves.

"Call us if you need anything," they added before leaving the room.

I felt Sebastian shift off the bed, and then something soft was draped over me—his shirt, covering me as he carefully lifted me into his arms. The pain meds were finally taking effect, my eyelids growing heavy.

"Sleep, love," he whispered.

The last thing I felt was the cool night air against my skin before I surrendered to the darkness.

Sebastian’s POV

The moment she fell asleep, the rage I’d been suppressing surged to the surface. Seeing her like that—broken, bleeding—nearly shattered my control.

It took everything in me to carry her to our room. Sophia was already waiting, curling protectively beside Evelyn the second I laid her down.

And now, I had a pack to deal with.

###Chapter 0190

The guys trailed behind me as I stormed out of the bedroom and down to the training area. Only one person could handle the storm raging inside me right now. Grayson didn't need asking - he was already stripping off his shirt as the others formed a loose circle around us.

My face was already a mess of dried blood, but I craved more pain. Grayson didn't hold back, and neither did I. We channeled every ounce of frustration, every spark of rage, every shred of helplessness into our brutal exchange. He was the only other man who loved Evelyn nearly as much as I did. His love was different, but no less fierce.

Time lost meaning as we fought. Neither emerged victorious. When we finally stopped, I was more battered than before, though the wounds would heal by tomorrow. Grayson and I clasped forearms in silent understanding before grabbing our discarded shirts.

Not a word was spoken as we dispersed. Oliver came to collect Sophia while I headed for the shower. The water ran brown at first, stinging my fresh wounds - a mere fraction of the agony Evelyn had endured. Her refusal to numb the pain remained incomprehensible to me.

After everything she'd suffered, anyone would want relief. Maybe she needed the pain to feel grounded in reality? I couldn't fathom what she'd experienced in that room, going through the motions of survival.

My fist clenched involuntarily. I'd failed her. Her worst nightmare had become reality on my watch. Sliding into bed with extreme care, I felt the mattress dip. Even in sleep, Evelyn turned toward me, instinctively seeking comfort though her bandaged arms restricted movement.

"Shh, I'm here," I murmured, resting my head against hers. As my arm settled across her waist, her tense body gradually relaxed, her breathing evening out. Physically, she'd recover without complications, but she'd need constant vigilance now. She wouldn't leave my sight for a second.

Evelyn's POV

Pain dragged me from sleep - my shoulders screaming in protest. Whether from immobility or prolonged dislocation, I couldn't tell. Sebastian's steady presence beside me brought immediate comfort.

"Sebastian?" I nudged him weakly with my knee.

"Hmm?"

"Can you... unwrap me?"

He blinked awake, concern etching his features. "Your bandages?"

"Yes. I need to move."

He sat up carefully, fingers working at the medical wrappings. With each layer removed, more bruising appeared. Someone had removed the shirt he'd dressed me in earlier, leaving me exposed when the final bandage came off.

Angry purple and blue mottled my shoulders, chest, arms, and likely my back too, with faint yellow edges suggesting healing had begun. The slight movement freedom brought instant relief, though everything remained stiff and sore.

Sebastian retrieved something from the floor. "Here." He guided my arms gently into a soft shirt, easing it over my head. "How are your shoulders feeling?"

###Chapter 0191

"Everything aches but it's manageable."

"Good. Stay put and I'll have breakfast sent up." Sebastian adjusted the pillows behind me carefully. He positioned two behind my back to prop me up at an angle, then placed one under each arm for support. Once I was settled, he rose from the bed.

"You're not leaving, are you?" My voice came out softer than intended.

He froze mid-step, turning to look at me. "I won't be going anywhere for quite some time." His words were firm before he disappeared into the bathroom.

Relaxing proved impossible. Not because of the physical pain, but the gnawing anxiety whenever Sebastian left my sight. I despised this feeling - this sudden vulnerability. I was Evelyn Andrews, damn it. Strong. Independent. Weakness wasn't in my vocabulary. Yet here I was, fighting panic over a few moments alone.

"What's wrong?" Sebastian emerged shirtless, revealing an alarming patchwork of bruises across his torso. Some faded to yellow, others fresh and angry purple.

"Why do you have bruises in different stages of healing?" I frowned at the discolored patches.

"Needed to blow off steam last night. Sparred with Grayson. He's the only one who can handle me at full strength." He shrugged like discussing the weather before settling beside me, careful not to make contact.

"Hold me?" The request slipped out before I could stop it.

Sebastian grabbed the remote, flipping channels until landing on a cooking competition. He shifted closer, draping one arm above my head to play with my hair - the closest we could get without aggravating my injuries. Both my arms were in no condition for cuddling anyway.

Twenty minutes later, my bladder demanded attention. Moving hurt, but waiting wasn't an option. I sucked in a breath and pushed upright.

"Damn, that stings." My elbows straightened without issue - small mercies - but my shoulders screamed protest. The angry red marks circling my wrists served as stark reminders of yesterday's ordeal.

A knock interrupted my hobble toward the bathroom. "That'll be breakfast." Sebastian waited until I'd closed the bathroom door before answering it.

Navigating underwear with sore limbs proved challenging enough. The real test came after.

"You alright?" Sebastian's voice echoed through our mind-link when I took too long.

"Yeah, just... complicated logistics." The mirror reflected my grimace as I attempted shoulder rotations, succeeding only in amplifying the pain.

"What are you doing?" Sebastian pushed the door open, catching me mid-wince.

"Trying to work out the stiffness. Not helping."

"Let me." He positioned himself behind me, taking my arm gently. As I relaxed into his grip, he guided my limb through motions I couldn't manage alone. The relief was immediate.

"That's better." I sighed as he finished with the other arm.

"Good. We'll ice them after eating. Want to try showering?"

"After food." My legs felt suspiciously unreliable.

Sebastian guided me to the couch where he'd arranged a breakfast spread - fresh fruits, vegetables, and neatly stacked sandwiches. "Roast beef or turkey?" He held up two options.

The domestic normalcy of the moment clashed violently with yesterday's horrors. But for now, with sunlight streaming through the windows and Sebastian's steady presence, I could almost pretend we were just two people sharing breakfast. Almost.

###Chapter 0192

"Turkey, please." Sebastian grabbed the plate with turkey and added some berries to it while I settled against the couch. His body tensed for a split second before he continued piling random things onto the plate.

"What?" I asked. He handed me the plate with a frown.

"Sophia wants to come see you. So does everyone else." Sebastian sighed as he took the roast beef and loaded his own plate with fruit.

"What did you tell them?"

"Grayson is on his way up, but the rest will have to wait until you've showered and relaxed a bit."

No sooner had he finished speaking than a knock sounded at the door. Thankfully, Sebastian got up to answer it.

Grayson and Sebastian exchanged a brief handshake before he strode over to me.

"How are you feeling, sis?" Grayson sat close but kept enough distance to avoid jostling me.

"Sore. Food and a hot shower should help."

Grayson reached over and tugged my shirt collar down slightly to inspect the bruises. "Impressive."

"They'll still be there tomorrow for prom." Sebastian and Grayson exchanged a glance. "What?"

"About prom… we were thinking maybe we should skip it," Grayson said as I took a bite.

"Skip prom?" I kept chewing while they watched me.

"We're also moving forward with the attack tonight. Sebastian will stay here with you, but the rest of us are going. Things are too volatile right now for a public event like that." Grayson laid it out bluntly.

My heart sank a little at the thought of missing prom. It wasn’t the dance itself I was sad about—it was all the hours Audrey and I had spent planning it. Seeing it all come together and everyone enjoying themselves was supposed to be the reward. "Okay."

"We could have a small prom here instead?" Grayson offered, as if trying to soften the blow.

Wanting to shift the conversation, I asked, "Are we still doing lunch on Sunday?"

Grayson frowned but didn’t push the topic. "Yes, we are."

"And our tests?"

"Rescheduled for Monday," Sebastian answered for him.

"I’m sorry. I know this isn’t what you wanted," Grayson said, placing a hand on my knee.

"Nobody asked for any of this. To think, my biggest worry used to be getting stuck with Margaret." I shook my head. "I miss when that was my only problem."

The guys stayed silent, letting me process my emotions. With each bite, I focused on a new thought.

Rogues are hunting me to drag me to Dominic. I can’t believe the only reason he wants me is to use me. There has to be more to it. Being trapped in that building was my worst nightmare come to life. It’s a strange feeling—now that my fear has already happened, I’m not as terrified as I was, but the panic still lingers. Still, I won’t let it define me.

Alpha Benjamin and Luna Amelia won’t give Sebastian the Alpha title until this is all over. They just want me to leave, to hand control over to them. So far, we’ve followed their strategy, and it hasn’t worked. Their plan is failing, and we need to change it.

"Are you going to tell me what’s going on in there?" Grayson asked after a while.

"Things need to change," I said simply, not looking at either of them.

"What do you mean?" Sebastian asked.

"I mean, I’m going to shower, and then we’re having a full meeting with Alpha Benjamin, Dad, and everyone else. I’m done standing on the sidelines. If my life is at stake, I won’t let someone else dictate my actions. We attack tonight—and this is our declaration of war. They’ve had too many victories. I won’t start my Luna reign as someone who just takes it. No. This ends now. With me."

###Chapter 0193

I rose from my seat, brushing past Sebastian as I made my way to the shower. Just as the door was about to click shut, their voices reached me. "Oh damn," Grayson muttered under his breath.

"This should be interesting. I've been waiting for her to finally lose it." Sebastian's tone carried an amused lilt, almost like he was suppressing laughter.

"I'll alert the pack. The storm's coming." Grayson declared before I firmly shut the door.

The scalding water pounded against my sore muscles, working out the tension. I rotated my neck, letting the heat penetrate every aching joint. While my shoulders bore the worst of it, my knees screamed in protest from being restrained for so long. But the real problem surfaced when I tried washing my hair.

"Sebastian?" I mind-linked him.

"Yes, love?"

"I can't fucking wash my own hair." I sensed his struggle to contain his amusement, though he didn't entirely succeed. Instead of responding, I heard the bathroom door swing open followed by some shuffling.

Suddenly Sebastian stepped into the shower with me.

"Turn around," he commanded, adjusting to the water's temperature. I obeyed without hesitation. The snap of the shampoo cap opening sent anticipation coursing through me - he was going to help.

"Where's Grayson?" The image of him waiting outside while Sebastian showered with me unsettled me more than I cared to admit.

"He's rallying the pack downstairs." Sebastian rotated me to rinse the suds from my hair.

"I'm done feeling powerless," I confessed after a weighted silence. His fingers worked conditioner through my tangled strands.

"Good." His response was simple yet loaded.

"Just good?" I turned back, letting him rinse my hair again. He reached for the body wash, his touch methodical as he cleansed every inch of me.

"Yes. I'm proud you're not letting what happened define you. You're reclaiming control - turning pain into power. I'll stand with you every step, but this proves your strength." Cradling my face, his intense gaze locked onto mine. "You're my everything. I'll always be by your side. We're taking back what's ours."

His unwavering support only stoked the fire within. "And Grayson?" I asked as Sebastian moved us so he could shower properly.

"Will be right there with us."

"Your parents might be the only opposition," I ventured, anticipating obstacles.

"Fuck them." He shrugged, shampoo lathering in his dark hair. Eyes closed beneath the water's cascade, he seemed at peace despite the storm coming.

My heart ached for him. Defying one's parents wasn't easy, especially when they'd urged us to flee to Italy and ignore the kidnapping. Some things you can't simply walk away from.

The water shut off abruptly, pulling me from my thoughts. Sebastian's hands steadied me as we stepped out, his towel moving over my skin with careful precision. "I can do that," I protested.

"I know." There was nothing sensual about his ministrations - just primal need to ensure every injury was accounted for. Yellowing bruises circled my wrists and ankles, while angry marks decorated my legs, stomach, and chest - some I couldn't even remember receiving.

"Let's dress and face the pack," Sebastian said, finishing by brushing out my damp hair.

###Chapter 0194

"Ready?" Sebastian asked me. I slipped into a tank top and athletic shorts, the fabric cool against my skin. He handed me two compression sleeves, and though it took a few adjustments, I couldn’t deny they eased the lingering stiffness in my shoulders.

Sebastian finished gearing up while I studied my reflection in the mirror. "Yeah," I said, squaring my shoulders. "As ready as I'll ever be." The anger had settled into something colder, sharper—enough to fuel me through what was coming.

"Good. Let’s go." His palm pressed against the small of my back as we walked toward the door. The packhouse was eerily silent, the usual hum of activity absent. It was still the school year, but this unnatural quiet made my skin prickle.

When we reached Alpha Benjamin’s office, his voice cut through the door. "What the hell is this about, Grayson?" He was already furious. Sebastian gave me a subtle nod before we stepped inside.

"Because I wanted everyone here," I said firmly, striding in. Sebastian followed, his presence radiating quiet authority. The door clicked shut behind us.

Alpha Benjamin, Luna Amelia, Oliver, and Grayson. The speakerphone crackled with my father’s voice. "Evelyn. It’s good to hear you. How are you holding up?"

"We’ll talk about me later, Dad," I said, moving to the center of the room. "I didn’t come for small talk." Sebastian positioned himself slightly to the side, arms crossed, his gaze never leaving me.

"Then what’s this about?" Dad’s tone was wary.

"I’m done." The words were simple, my stare locked onto Alpha Benjamin. "Done being sidelined. Done being kept in the dark. Done being told you’ll handle things. With all due respect, your handling didn’t stop Dominic from kidnapping me. From now on, we’re involved in everything. Every decision, every piece of intel—it goes through us. I have a genius IQ, and I won’t be tucked away on some useless vacation while our pack is under attack. I refuse to be the Luna who hides when things get hard. Dominic and Damian need to be dealt with—permanently."

My voice was ice. The room was so silent I could hear my own heartbeat. No one moved. Dad stayed quiet. Alpha Benjamin’s eyes narrowed. Luna Amelia looked stunned, gripping the arms of her chair. I didn’t glance at Grayson, Oliver, or Sebastian, but I could feel Sebastian’s pride like a warm pulse against my skin.

After a long pause, Alpha Benjamin spoke. "You’re certain this is what you want?"

"It’s not about wanting," I said. "I was born to a Luna. Mated to an Alpha. Handling crises is in my blood. Being kidnapped won’t send me cowering under the covers. I can handle this. I will handle this. But until now, you’ve never given me the chance. You sidelined me. You sidelined your son. You showed us zero trust. So yes, I’m standing here, demanding—respectfully—that you cut the bullshit and let us take control of this situation."

"You think storming into my office and making demands will get you what you want?" His voice was deceptively calm, but the undercurrent of anger was unmistakable.

"You would’ve dismissed any other approach," I shot back. "Even Luna Amelia suggested we just ‘focus on being mates’ and ignore the threats. That doesn’t work for me. Not anymore. You weren’t the one tied to a chair. You weren’t the one beaten and violated. You have no idea what I went through. So yes, I’m demanding a seat at the table. They attacked our pack. They took me—the future Luna. And now? I’m taking my place in this fight."

The air crackled with tension. No one dared to breathe.

Then Alpha Benjamin leaned forward, his gaze sharp. "Prove it."

A challenge.

Good.

I was more than ready.

###Chapter 0195

"You're backing this?" Alpha Benjamin's piercing gaze shifted to Sebastian.

"Absolutely. We should've never been excluded. This is about our lives, and Evelyn could've died."

Alpha Benjamin studied me before his eyes dropped to my injured shoulders. "Of course I'm relieved you're alright, but shouldn't you focus on recovering?"

"No. That's not happening." Sebastian moved forward, positioning himself protectively behind me as he confronted his father. "I never should've let you sideline us from the start. Every decision you've made has only made things worse. We need to be part of this. Evelyn has the intelligence to solve problems. Use her."

"Dad, care to weigh in?" I demanded firmly.

"I had no idea they were kept in the dark this entire time. Why weren't they involved?" My father's voice held barely restrained anger.

Grayson stood abruptly. "If you refuse to include them, then I'll make sure they're informed. Keeping them out is unacceptable, and I'm appalled this even happened." His authority was undeniable. Though not officially Alpha yet—just days away—Alpha Benjamin remained unaware.

"Seems I'm outvoted," Alpha Benjamin muttered, glancing at Luna Amelia. "For the record, I think this is a terrible idea. They're not ready."

"How would you know when you've never given us a chance?" My temper flared. "With all due respect, you have no idea what I'm capable of. You've done nothing but push me aside. If I didn't know better, I'd say you're using me as an excuse to delay handing the Alpha title to Sebastian."

That ignited him. Alpha Benjamin slammed his palms on the desk and rose. "Listen here—"

"No." Sebastian stepped between us. "We've had this exact conversation before. I never repeated it to Evelyn—she figured it out herself. You will not speak to her like that. My stance is clear. I'll challenge you if necessary, but I'd rather we work together."

"Both of you, leave the room. Marc and I need to talk." My father's voice was steel wrapped in calm.

It took both Grayson and Sebastian half-dragging me out. I refused to break eye contact with Alpha Benjamin, making my defiance clear. Their care for my injuries slowed our exit, but once the door shut behind us, I finally exhaled.

"Seriously, man? You'd challenge him?" Grayson asked.

"I'm starting to think he won't relinquish power. It's always another excuse. I don't want to challenge him, but his decisions keep endangering the pack—endangering Evelyn."

"You know it's to the death..." Grayson emphasized. I stared at Sebastian in shock. I'd assumed it was a bluff.

"I won't risk Evelyn's life again without her having a say," Sebastian stated, unwavering.

"Sebastian..." I couldn't be the reason he challenged his father.

"This is my choice." His eyes burned with fury as he looked down at me.

"But not at my expense." He pulled me close, pressing a kiss to my forehead. "Grayson, tell him this is insane," I pleaded.

"Scarlett, I'd do the same." Grayson met my gaze. "I am doing the same—helping Dad reject her. And we both know it might kill him."

"That's not the same!" I snapped, forgetting my sling as I tried to reach for him. A sharp pain shot down my spine.

###Chapter 0196

The office door creaked open, and Amelia Blackwood peeked out, motioning for us to return.

The entire time, Oliver remained silent, and only then did I realize Nathan was missing. Sebastian stood rigidly before his father, arms crossed. Grayson and I hung back—this conversation had shifted from me to the issue of inclusion.

It was now purely between father and son.

"We've agreed you'll both be included in all meetings and have access to all intel," Alpha Benjamin stated. "But final decisions remain mine."

"As long as our voices aren't dismissed," Sebastian countered. "We deserve equal say. These are our lives at stake. You've spent years preparing me to take your place."

"Which is exactly why I won't hand over control when things are this volatile," Benjamin replied, eerily calm.

"Good. Now that's settled," Alexander's voice crackled through the phone. "We need to finalize tonight's operation."

Benjamin leaned forward. "My team will plant explosives in the mechanical shop. Yours will handle any survivors."

"Why move it up a day instead of waiting for prom?" I asked.

"Three reasons," Benjamin said, locking eyes with me. "First—your kidnapping. Second—maximum impact with their business in full swing. We've got an operative delivering a rigged vehicle. Third—we need the upper hand now."

"What's next after the strike?" Sebastian demanded.

Grayson stepped in. "I've arranged for an upgraded security system tomorrow. It'll detect drones and movement within two miles of our borders. Motion-sensitive, so even animals could trigger it. We'll need constant monitoring."

"Is that where Nathan is?" I asked.

"Yes. Finalizing the details."

"Who's your Beta?" Benjamin questioned.

"Nathan will step up after proving himself in the next 24 hours," Grayson answered.

I scanned the room. "Any updates on Audrey's father?"

"Rumors say he's alive, but no name or photo yet," Alexander said.

"Beta Andrew is underground working on it," Benjamin added.

My gaze flicked to Oliver—that was his father. The worry in his eyes was unmistakable.

"We've been gathering intel before striking," Amelia spoke for the first time.

"We can't wait any longer," I said firmly. "Action is necessary. Intel is crucial, but it could take months. I won't wait that long for justice."

"I see that," Benjamin acknowledged. He slid a flash drive toward me. "Since you want involvement—review these files from the phone. See if we missed anything useful."

"Where are we doing this?" Sebastian asked.

"Your office," Amelia said with a knowing smile.


###Chapter 0197

"My office?" Sebastian asked, his brow furrowing in confusion.

"Exactly. I've spent the last two days preparing it for you. Come see." Amelia smiled warmly as she breezed past us. Sebastian shot me a questioning look but gently guided me forward with a hand on my back.

I vaguely recalled discussing this, but with everything happening, it had slipped my mind completely. Amelia waited until we gathered around the door before unlocking it. Swinging it open, she gestured for us to enter first.

My breath caught.

It was perfect—exactly as I'd envisioned. My sketches adorned the walls, and the desks I'd picked out were polished and arranged, one for each of us. The space wasn't enormous, but there was enough room for a sleek leather couch against the wall, a compact wet bar, and two plush cream armchairs facing the desks.

"I left some areas bare so you can personalize them," Amelia said, a small, satisfied smile playing on her lips. "Once you officially take over, we can rotate offices if needed."

"If I could hug you right now, I would," I breathed, overwhelmed by how flawlessly she'd brought my vision to life in such a short time.

"I'm so glad you love it!" Sebastian pulled his mother into a tight embrace.

"I left the phone for you to review—maybe you'll spot something we missed. Your login details are on sticky notes on the computers. Feel free to change the passwords."

"Thanks, Mom," Sebastian said as she turned to leave.

"Of course. We love you both." Amelia gave me one last warm smile before slipping out and closing the door behind her.

"We have an office," I whispered, still in awe.

Sebastian circled the room, claiming a desk. He booted up the computer and dragged the second chair over for me. The chairs—luxurious, ergonomic, and undoubtedly expensive—made me smirk.

"Where do you want to start? The pictures or something else?" Sebastian asked as folders popped up after he inserted the flash drive.

"Pictures first."

He nodded and double-clicked the folder.

Most were mundane—me by the pool, eating lunch outside, walking through the pack grounds. But each one was taken from a distance, my face clear but the background just as prominent.

Then it hit me.

"Oh... hell," I muttered, my stomach dropping.

"What?"

"Print them. All of them."

Sebastian blinked. "There are hundreds—"

"Just do it!" I shot to my feet, panic clawing at my throat.

"Okay, printing." He frowned. "What's wrong?"

My hands trembled. I needed them free. "Take these off me." My voice cracked, breath coming too fast.

Sebastian didn't hesitate, swiftly removing the slings.

As the pictures printed, I snatched scissors and began cutting. "Move the chairs. Clear the floor."

He obeyed without question.

One by one, I trimmed the photos, arranging them like puzzle pieces.

Sebastian inhaled sharply. "Holy... shit."

He bolted from the room—mind-linking clearly insufficient—and returned moments later with Benjamin and Grayson in tow.

I didn't stop.

My shoulders screamed in protest, pain lancing down my arms with every cut, but I refused to pause.

The realization had struck like lightning.

It wasn’t about me.

Every photo—every single one—was of the locations. The backgrounds. The territory.

And now, laid out before us, they formed a map.

A map of our pack’s weaknesses.

###Chapter 0198

My fingers trembled as I laid out the final photographs of my tattoo parlor. Each shot captured the street from every conceivable angle, with my shop as the central focus yet revealing the entire surrounding area. The images clearly showed the exact spot where Sebastian had been shot. "I'd stake my life on it - this is the precise angle where you took that bullet." My finger jabbed at the pavement where we'd stood that fateful day.

"What are you implying?" Alpha Benjamin's voice cracked with disbelief.

"I'm saying this wasn't just about me." My pulse hammered against my ribs. "Yes, he wanted me, but these photos reveal our entire pack's layout. Look!" I spread out the images like a macabre mosaic. "Here I am lounging by the pool with Sophia. Five different angles of the same moment. When you piece them together..." My hands moved frantically, arranging the puzzle. "It maps out the entire pool area, connects to the playground, leads straight to the school. They've charted our entire territory!"

The room fell deathly silent as their eyes darted between photographs. The horrifying truth only became clear when I aligned them properly. "He knows every inch of our land," Sebastian whispered, his face draining of color.

"He knew exactly how to kidnap me. Which routes to take. What areas to avoid." I spelled it out, watching comprehension dawn in their widening eyes.

"This can't be happening." Sebastian dragged his palms down his stubbled cheeks.

"But here's the worst part." My fingernail tapped the border patrol schedules clearly visible in several shots. "They know our security rotations."

Alpha Benjamin bolted from the room without another word. "You're certain about this?" Grayson asked, though his ashen face showed he already believed me.

"I barely glanced at these photos before today," I confessed, my throat tightening. "I never had the chance to really examine them until now."

Grayson's warm hand settled on my shoulder, then immediately withdrew when I flinched. "This isn't your fault, Scarlett." He stood abruptly, locking eyes with Sebastian. "I'm deploying extra warriors to reinforce the borders until we devise a new security plan."

"Agreed." Sebastian didn't argue. "We'll declare a state of emergency."

As Grayson left to make calls, the printer's mechanical whir filled the heavy silence between Sebastian and me. When he moved to stop it minutes later, I shouted, "Don't!"

"Why?"

"There might be more clues in these." At my sharp tone, Sebastian simply nodded. "Get Sophia in here," I ordered without looking up, already dissecting another photo with trembling fingers. The floor had become a sprawling jigsaw puzzle of our pack's vulnerabilities.

Oliver entered first, eyebrows raised at my frantic activity. "What's the emergency?"

"Scarlett?" Sophia knelt beside me, her usually vibrant complexion worryingly pale.

"I need your help. Remember that spatial reasoning test we did to assess my cognitive abilities?" My voice shook with urgency.

"The one that took us eight hours?" Her gaze swept across the scattered images.

"We need to do that again. These are the photos from the phone. Look closely - they're not just surveillance of me, but blueprints of our entire pack."

"Holy hell..." Oliver's curse echoed as he took in the damning evidence. I didn't care that some shots captured intimate moments between Sebastian and me.

"Get me scissors and a trash can," Sophia demanded, swallowing hard.

"Trash can?" Sebastian frowned.

"For when I vomit. It's been that kind of morning." I froze, really looking at her for the first time. Dark circles bruised her eyes, her skin the color of chalk.

"Sophia..." I reached for her hand.

"I'm fine. Better than staring at bathroom tiles all day." Her weak smile didn't reach her eyes as she turned to the task at hand, her determination outweighing her nausea.

###Chapter 0199

"Do you want something to eat? Maybe some fruit? Or nuts? What do you feel like?" I asked, glancing at Sophia.

"Lunchables," she replied, looking up at me. My gaze shifted from hers to Sebastian’s.

He gave a quick nod and left the room. We worked in silence for about fifteen minutes before Sophia suddenly leaned over and threw up into the trash can. Oliver walked in just in time to witness it. Without a word, he handed her a bottle of water and swiftly removed the trash bag.

"Have you tried Gatorade?" I suggested.

"What for?" Oliver asked, frowning.

"Electrolytes. She needs them. Gatorade or even Pedialyte would help."

"What flavor do you want?" Oliver turned to Sophia.

"Uh... lemon," she answered weakly.

I wrinkled my nose. "Lemon?"

"I know, but it sounds good right now," she said, giving me a knowing look.

Sebastian returned with the Lunchables just as Oliver was leaving. Sophia took one and began nibbling slowly.

Five minutes later, she spoke again. "Evelyn?"

"Yeah?" I responded without looking up.

"What does this look like to you?" She handed me a photograph.

My breath caught.

It was a picture of Sebastian and me in the woods—intimately entangled. I was straddling him against a tree, both of us lost in the moment.

"Looks like fun?" I said, forcing a smirk as I met her eyes.

"No, behind you. Is that... a hand?"

I snatched the photo from her and studied it closely.

There, in the background, barely visible among the trees, was what unmistakably looked like a human hand.

That part of the forest was supposed to be untouched—remote enough that no one should have seen us. The thrill of possibly getting caught had been part of the excitement.

But now, this photo proved someone had been there.

"Sebastian," I said, standing abruptly.

He was at my side in an instant. "What's wrong?"

"Does that look like a hand to you?" I pointed at the shadowy figure in the background.

He stiffened. "It... does."

"Sebastian, this was taken while we were—" I lowered my voice. "How the hell was there a hand behind us?"

His expression darkened. "I’ll handle this. Don’t leave this room. Understood? I’m posting a guard outside."

"Wait!" I grabbed his arm as he turned to go. "C-can you send someone else instead?" My voice wavered.

I hated how weak I sounded, but the panic was rising.

Sebastian hesitated, then cupped my chin. "I’ll have Oliver come back. Okay?"

I nodded. "But... wait until he’s here?"

He studied my face, seeing the fear I couldn’t hide. "Alright."

The moment he left, shame washed over me. I hated feeling this vulnerable—like I was still that terrified girl who had been taken.

Swallowing hard, I sank back into my chair and picked up the scissors. My hands trembled as I resumed cutting. Sophia noticed but said nothing, continuing her own work in silence.

Hours later—or what felt like hours—Oliver returned.

"Stay with them," Sebastian ordered. "I need to check something. Under no circumstances do you leave Evelyn’s sight."

"Got it," Oliver said, walking in with a bottle of lemon Gatorade. He handed it to Sophia before taking a seat.

"Can you—can you shut the door?" I blurted.

Oliver raised an eyebrow but complied. "Sure."

"Lock it?"

He gave me a questioning look but turned the lock. When he glanced back, I nodded, satisfied.

As he sat beside Sophia, watching us work, I reached out through the mind-link.

"Sebastian?"

"Are you okay?" His voice was tight, already knowing the answer.

"Can we... keep this open?"

"Of course." His breathing was uneven, like he was running.

"I’m sorry, I just—"

"I know," he cut in gently. "It’s okay."

And for the first time since seeing that photo, I felt the slightest bit of calm.

###Chapter 0200

"Almost there," Sebastian murmured. His voice was low, distracted. "Keep working. I'll update you if I find anything."

"Got it." I picked up another photograph, my scissors moving slower this time. The printer had finally stopped its relentless humming, and I breathed a sigh of relief. Sophia was working faster now after the Gatorade and Lunchables—though I had a feeling processed snacks weren't the best choice for her. Still, her color had improved, so I wasn’t going to argue.

I lifted another photo, carefully trimming the edges to match the location without overlapping. Just as I was about to make the final cut, something caught my eye—a face, half-hidden behind a tree.

My stomach twisted.

"Oliver…" My voice came out strained.

"What?" He moved closer, his brow furrowed.

"Look." I handed him the partially cut photo.

His eyes narrowed. "That's a head."

The picture showed me on a run, Sebastian beside me. Neither of us had noticed the figure lurking in the background.

"Doesn't it look familiar?" I pressed.

Oliver hesitated. "I'm not sure…"

"Sophia, doesn't that look like someone?" I snatched the photo back and passed it to her.

She squinted, then her eyes widened. "Audrey?"

"The nose is identical!" I said.

"And the face shape—that little smirk she does," Sophia agreed.

"We can't prove it's her, but it's enough to make us pause," I muttered, staring at the shadowed face.

"Where was this taken?" Oliver asked. "A stranger—twenty feet from you and Sebastian. How did they get that close?"

"Other side of the territory. Near the pond," I said. "Almost where we ran into those rogues."

"Are you telling Sebastian?" I asked.

Oliver exhaled sharply. "Yeah."

"Did they find the other location?" Sophia asked.

"They did." He didn't elaborate.

"Sebastian?" I reached through the mind-link.

"Everything okay?" His response was breathless, like he'd been running.

"Did you find something?"

"A tunnel. Sent some warriors to track where it leads. I'm heading to the other location you marked."

"I only have a tree. It could be anywhere."

"I know, but we have to check. My father called in specialists—they're scanning the ground with sonar for hidden tunnels."

"This is bad," I whispered.

"Did you finish the rest of the photos?" Sebastian asked.

"Almost. Just a few left."

"Good. Let me know if you find anything else. If not, move on to the next part of the phone."

"How much longer will you be?" I hated how needy I sounded.

"Not sure. Adrian's handling some things, and Grayson's working his end too."

"This is spiraling. We might need to evacuate the entire pack. Think about it—any of us could've been taken or hurt at any time. Is it even safe here?" Sophia was finishing the last photo while Oliver studied the one with the hidden figure.

"I was thinking the same. Maybe move the women and children out, leave the warriors ready for an attack. After tonight, they could strike as early as tomorrow." Sebastian's voice was tight, like he was still running.

"Send them to Grayson's pack during the attack. Keep the enemy distracted," I suggested.

"Wish I could be with you, but take Oliver and update my father." He sounded distant now, his focus split.

"Okay." I didn't sever the mind-link, just pushed it to the back of my thoughts. If I wanted, I could still hear him, but I tuned him out. "Oliver?"

"Yeah?"

"I need to speak with Alpha Benjamin. Can you take me?" I stood, and he didn't hesitate.

"Of course. Sophia, you good here?"

She waved us off. "Go. I'll be fine."

###Chapter 0201

"I'm not going anywhere. My legs are completely numb," Sophia muttered, her eyes still glued to the remaining photos in her hands.

Oliver nodded and opened the door, gesturing for me to step out first. He locked it behind us before we made our way to Benjamin's office. A single knock, and then Oliver pushed the door open.

"What is it? Did you find something else?" Alpha Benjamin's brows furrowed as I walked in.

"There's another photo of—" I started, but Oliver moved forward and handed it to him before I could finish. "Does that man look like Audrey to you?" I redirected.

Benjamin rubbed his chin, leaning back in his chair. "I don't know," he admitted after a pause. "And I'd rather not stare at a photo of my son and his mate in an intimate moment."

"Focus on the part where this stranger isn’t from our pack," I pressed urgently. "He was standing right behind us, and we didn’t even notice."

Benjamin shot me a skeptical look. "Given the circumstances, I can see why you missed him."

"Look at the location—it's by the pond. The same place where we found the rogues. The same place that’s on the opposite side of the pack from the first tunnel."

His expression darkened as I laid it all out. His hands clenched together, knuckles whitening, his body rigid. His piercing gaze locked onto mine, unblinking. At first, I wasn’t sure if he was mind-linking Sebastian or just processing the gravity of the situation.

After a long silence, I finally spoke. "Sebastian and I have a plan. We wanted to run it by you first."

His jaw tightened. "Go on."

"They don’t know we’ve discovered these tunnels—or if there are more. But when we strike tonight, we should move all the women, children, and elderly to Grayson’s pack. Only the warriors stay behind. We turn our territory into a battlefield—set traps, prepare for an ambush. Sebastian thinks they might attack as early as tomorrow morning."

Benjamin just stared at me, his expression unreadable. The silence stretched for what felt like an eternity before he finally spoke. "Have you discussed this with Grayson or your father?"

"No, sir. We wanted your input first. Given our alliance and your experience in these matters, we weren’t sure how you’d feel about the plan."

Instead of answering, Benjamin picked up the speakerphone and dialed. It rang twice before my father’s voice filled the room.

"Benjamin."

"I’m here with Evelyn. We’ve uncovered something you need to know." Benjamin leaned back, motioning for me to continue.

"Oliver, can you bring that chair closer? I need to sit," I said.

Without a word, he rolled an armchair up to the desk. Benjamin adjusted the phone so I could speak clearly.

"Evelyn? What’s going on?" Dad’s voice was laced with concern.

"I’m assuming Grayson already briefed you about the tunnel?" I asked, hoping to skip the lengthy explanation.

"Briefly. I know about it, but not the details."

"Okay, well, we found another one—on the opposite side of the pack, near where the rogues crossed the border. And the man in the photo… he looks like Audrey. Alpha Benjamin isn’t convinced, but I think the resemblance is too close to ignore."

###Chapter 0202

Nathan was silent for a long moment. "This is absolute madness." His voice was heavy with exhaustion.

"Sebastian and I have a plan," I said quickly.

"What is it?"

"Tonight, while the chaos unfolds, we need to move all the women, children, and elderly to your pack. With everyone distracted, it's the perfect opportunity to get them to safety. Then, we can use our territory to set up an ambush—let them think they're coming back for revenge. Sebastian believes they’ll strike by dawn." I kept my words measured, unsure who might be listening on his end.

"That... could work," Nathan admitted slowly. "But they might have scouts watching. We’d have to move everyone in waves, fast. We’ll take in anyone who needs shelter, but with the attack, our warriors will be stretched thin."

"We haven’t ironed out all the details yet—just the broad strokes. We wanted your thoughts before finalizing anything," I said, trying to sound as composed and authoritative as possible.

"You have four hours," Nathan said, his tone shifting to something firmer, almost hopeful. "Present a full plan before our warriors leave. Understood?"

"Yes, sir," I replied, feeling a flicker of confidence.

"Evelyn?" His voice softened slightly.

"Yeah?"

"How are you holding up?"

"Physically? I’ve been better. Not as bad as yesterday, though. The shower helped." I shifted slightly, testing my sore muscles.

"And emotionally? Mentally?" he pressed.

"Working on it," I muttered, suddenly aware of Oliver and Alpha Benjamin listening intently. "It’s... a process. I’d rather not be alone right now."

"That’s normal," Nathan assured me. "After what you’ve been through, needing someone close is completely understandable. Don’t feel ashamed of that."

"Thanks, Dad," I murmured, suddenly feeling exposed.



"I’ll talk to you in four hours," he said before hanging up, leaving me with a strange sense of encouragement.

"See you in four hours," Alpha Benjamin added, his smile so faint I almost missed it.

Oliver held the door open as I stepped out of the office. "That went better than I expected," he whispered as we approached my workspace.

"Same. I thought he’d tear my head off," I muttered under my breath.

Inside, Sophia was waiting, looking triumphant.

"All done!" she announced proudly, and I couldn’t help but smile.

"Any new leads?" I asked, sinking into my chair.

"Nothing jumping out at me," she sighed.

"Listen, I have a new task for you. Remember how I organized your Beta duties?"

"Of course. I still use that system every day," she said, tilting her head in confusion.

"Good. I need a headcount of all the women, children, and elderly here who aren’t fit to fight." She blinked, then glanced at Oliver.

"Baby, can you grab my laptop from our room?"

"Sure," Oliver said, standing immediately—then hesitating, his eyes flicking to me for permission.

"Make it quick," I said, looking down. My pulse spiked, but I forced myself to stay calm. There was no reason to panic over him walking down the hall and coming right back.

"Scarlett?" Sophia’s voice pulled me from my spiraling thoughts.

"Yeah?" I asked, bracing myself for whatever question was coming.

###Chapter 0203

"Will we make it through this?" Sophia's voice trembled as she spoke, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. The fear in them was palpable, raw and unfiltered.

I swallowed hard, forcing my own anxiety down. "I'm doing everything I can to make sure we do."

Sophia nodded, her hands instinctively cradling her swollen belly. Watching her, I couldn’t help but feel a surge of relief that I wasn’t in her position. The thought of carrying a child right now, with everything happening, sent a chill down my spine. If—no, when—Sebastian and I had children, I wanted it to be peaceful. Safe. But Sophia’s pregnancy was anything but.

Oliver returned then, slightly breathless, his chest rising and falling rapidly. He must have sprinted the entire way.

"Here," he said, handing over a thick folder.

"Thank you." Sophia took it, flipping it open with practiced efficiency. "I’ve got the list of pack members. Just give me a minute to organize them."

"That’s fine." I turned to Oliver. "I’ll need your help. My arms aren’t exactly functional right now."

Oliver moved to sit in Sebastian’s vacant chair. "What do you need?"

"Sophia, can you connect to the printer and print out the pack blueprints?" I asked.

"On it." She barely glanced up, already absorbed in her task.

"Oliver, I need you to sketch a rough map of the distance between our pack and Grayson’s."

He grabbed a blank sheet of paper and began outlining landmarks. His drawing skills were… lacking, to say the least. The lines were shaky, the proportions off, but it was still decipherable.

"The woods would give us decent cover," I mused, studying his crude sketch. "But they’d also hide Grayson’s warriors just as easily."

"What about by road?" Oliver traced a wobbly line meant to represent the main path between territories.

"Possibly. It’s the fastest route, and we could move larger groups at once. But that depends on how many people we’re relocating." Our options weren’t exactly plentiful.

"We could take an alternate path," I suggested, drawing a curved line that looped around the edge of our territory. "It’s longer, but if they’re watching the main roads, this might throw them off. We don’t have time to set up surveillance in the trees."

Oliver frowned. "That’s all forest."

"Not entirely. There’s an old dirt road there—unused for over a decade." I met his gaze, confidence settling in my chest. This could work.

"Is this your genius 144 IQ talking?" Oliver smirked as the printer whirred to life behind him.

"It is." I exhaled, rubbing my temple. "I still feel like I’m missing something, but yeah… this feels solid."

Oliver pulled the freshly printed blueprints from the tray, taping the sheets together until they formed one large map. I had to stand to take it all in.

"Mark where the rogue attack happened and where each location was discovered." My tone might have been sharper than intended, but neither of them seemed to notice.

Oliver grabbed push pins, placing one where the tunnel had been found. Moving to the opposite side, he marked the rogue attack site. I leaned in, pointing to the spot where Sebastian and I had been when that damning photo was taken.

Staring at the blueprints, confusion gnawed at me. Not confusion, exactly—more like frustration. Why would they place a tunnel there? Was it just to attack from both sides? But something about the photo nagged at me. The person in it hadn’t looked like they were preparing an assault. They’d been scouting. Surveying the land, calculating distances.

The problem was, both marked areas were roughly the same distance from any significant structure. And in wolf territory, the packhouse was the heart of everything. The Alpha’s domain. The center of power, strategy, and secrets. If an enemy wanted to cripple us, that was their target. Everything else would crumble after.

###Chapter 0204

The tunnels would have required years of meticulous planning. Alpha Damian must have started this long before Dominic even crossed paths with me. Perhaps this wasn't entirely about me, as we had assumed. Maybe they were using me as a decoy—something to divert attention while they pursued something far more sinister.

If everyone was focused on protecting me, their eyes would be off everything else.

"Evelyn? What's wrong?" Oliver asked, snapping me out of my thoughts. I hadn’t realized he was staring at me, confusion etched across his face. Sophia had risen from her seat, her brows furrowed in concern.

"You've figured something out," she stated, more certain than questioning.

"Maybe," I murmured, unwilling to elaborate just yet.

"Alpha Benjamin, could you come to my office?" I reached out through the mind-link.

"On my way." His response was immediate.

There was a secret here—one I wasn’t privy to. And I wasn’t sure Oliver knew either.

A sharp knock at the door made both Oliver and Sophia whip their heads toward the sound. Oliver’s body tensed as he moved to answer it.

"What is it?" Alpha Benjamin strode past Oliver without hesitation, his gaze dropping to the blueprint spread across my desk. His frown deepened.

"This wasn’t adding up," I explained, gesturing to the push pins marking key locations. "Here’s where we found the tunnel. Over here is where the rogues attacked, and this is where the other photo was taken."

He studied the map. "And?"

"It would have taken years for Alpha Damian to dig these tunnels. Years. He would’ve had to move slowly to avoid detection, carefully cutting through tree roots without killing the trees. He must have started this long before I ever arrived."

I traced the points with my finger. "These spots form an equal distance from the packhouse—not perfectly aligned, but close. I think there might be a third tunnel here." I tapped a blank space on the map. "But my point is, Alpha Damian has been planning this for years. I think they’re using me as a distraction—keeping everyone focused on protecting me from Dominic while he works toward something else entirely."

Alpha Benjamin fell silent, his eyes darting between the marked points before settling on the potential third location. It would form a perfect triangle with the packhouse at its center. He braced his hands on the desk, leaning forward as if the answer might reveal itself if he stared hard enough.

I glanced up to find Sophia and Oliver both stunned, their expressions shifting from shock to frustration.

Sophia crossed her arms. "So what’s the plan for evacuating the women, children, and elderly?" she demanded.

Alpha Benjamin straightened, his posture stiff, as if deliberately ignoring my revelation.

I hesitated, thrown by his reaction, but answered anyway. "W-we were thinking of using the old dirt road on the far side of your territory. Taking the long way around—they’re probably watching the main routes."

"Fine. Proceed with your plan. Our forces are assembling now." He turned to Oliver. "You need to report for duty."

Without another word, Alpha Benjamin strode out, leaving us all speechless.

"What just happened?" I whispered to Oliver.

"He didn’t like what you had to say," Oliver muttered, staring at the open door.

"He’s hiding something," I murmured.

Oliver gave a slow nod.

"Do you have to go?" Sophia’s voice was small, her hands resting protectively over her swollen belly.

"I do." Oliver cupped her face, his thumb brushing her cheek. "Stay here. Sebastian will be up soon. I’ll fill him in, but I need to go."

A single tear slipped down Sophia’s face. "We love you," she whispered as he pressed a gentle kiss to her lips.

I averted my gaze, feeling like an intruder in their private moment.

Oliver pulled away reluctantly, his eyes lingering on Sophia before he turned and left. Sophia watched him go, then moved to shut the door, locking it behind her.

###Chapter 0205


Sophia turned to face me, exhaling sharply. "What's next?"

"Make a list. We'll have waves of people being transported. I need to give them an exact number. Keep families together and calculate how many vehicles we can manage per trip."

"I can handle that." As much as I adored Sophia, I needed extra help.

"Sebastian?" I reached out through the mind-link, unsure how else to get his attention.

"What? I'm finishing something—I'll be up soon. Oliver just briefed me."

"I need Audrey’s help with the evacuation plans."

"I’ll call Grayson and have him connect her directly to the office. That work?" Sebastian’s voice was strained, his anger barely contained.

"Thanks." I ended the link before his frustration could seep into me. "Sophia, can you take these off me?" I gestured to the heavy gear weighing me down.

"Of course." She stood, moving to help. The fabric tugged uncomfortably over my head, but once free, I could breathe easier. "You okay?" she asked, setting the gear aside just as the phone rang.

"Audrey?" I answered.

"No, it’s Grayson. What’s going on?" His voice sounded distant, like he was multitasking.

"I need Audrey. We’re running out of time before the evacuations start, and—"

"Sebastian already filled me in. Oliver said we move when the battle begins," Grayson cut in.

"Right. I need another pair of hands—someone to confirm each vehicle’s timing and passenger count. I’ll email the details, but I need her to verify everything."

"We don’t have time for delays. Figure this out fast." Grayson’s tone was clipped. The office door swung open, and Sebastian strode in, drenched in sweat, his jaw clenched.

"I’m trying," I snapped, matching his irritation.

"I’ll call Audrey and have her monitor your line. Use this number—it’s our landline. Write it down. Gotta go."



"Wait, Grayson!" I rushed before he could hang up.

"What?"

"Be careful. I... love you."

"Not the time for sentimentality," he teased, chuckling faintly. "Love you too, sis." The line went dead.

"Explain." Sebastian braced his hands on the desk, leaning forward, impatience rolling off him. His alpha aura thickened, making Sophia shrink back.

I stood, pointing to the map. "Look. These are the attack points. They’re not scattered randomly—they form a perfect triangle." I placed another pin. "The pack house is dead center. And these tunnels? They took years to dig, not months. This wasn’t planned after I met Dominic. Damian’s been scheming long before I showed up. He’s using Dominic as a decoy—keeping us focused on a kidnapping plot while he moves elsewhere."

"He did kidnap you," Sebastian growled, struggling to process it.

###Chapter 0206

"Yes, but I was left completely alone for most of the time. I only saw Dominic or Alpha Damian maybe three times total. Trust me, I remember every word he said, every move he made—but looking back now, something doesn’t add up. There’s more going on here. Something bigger than just Dominic wanting me."

Sebastian’s gaze locked onto mine. "What did my father say?"

"He ignored me completely and asked about the evacuation plan instead."

"Damn it." Sebastian sat up sharply, running his hands through his hair.

"What did you find?" I pressed.

"Two tunnels. We only spotted the second one because a warrior saw a rat crawling out of it. They stretch about five miles, emptying into the woods outside our territory. The entrances are hidden under vines and wooden doors—no way anyone would notice them. We’ve probably walked right over them before without realizing."

"If you need to find the third one, go. I’ll be fine," I said flatly.

Sebastian hesitated, torn. His stress and indecision radiated through our bond. He wanted to stay, but the pack’s safety came first. "I promised I wouldn’t leave you."

"You’re not leaving me. I’m telling you to go. Our pack needs you."

"Will you really be okay?" He cupped my face, his thumbs brushing my cheeks. "Don’t lie to me. I can feel how unsettled you are."

"Yes, I’m jumpy. Yes, I’m uneasy. But we can’t risk the pack. I’ll be fine. I promise."

"I’ll be fast." He pressed a kiss to my forehead.

"Better be," I murmured as he turned to leave. He flashed me a quick smile before disappearing through the door.

Sophia spoke up the moment he was gone. "I have the list of everyone who needs to evacuate."

"Good. How many?" The phone rang before she could answer.

"Evelyn," I answered.

"It’s me," Audrey’s voice came through.

"Perfect. Can you help us coordinate?" I put her on speaker.

"Of course. The safe houses are being prepped. Everyone will gather in one location—both packs will fit just—"

"Grayson?" I cut in before she could hang up.

"What?"

"Be careful. I... love you."

"Now’s not the time to get sentimental," he teased, chuckling. "Love you too, sis." The line went dead.

"Tell me what happened," Sebastian demanded, his fists clenched on the desk. He leaned forward, barely containing his impatience. His alpha aura crackled in the air, making Sophia shift uncomfortably.

"Look." I stood and pointed to each pushpin on the map. "These are the attack points. They don’t form a straight line like I thought—if you place another here, it makes a perfect triangle. The pack house is right in the center. And these tunnels? They would’ve taken years to dig. Not months. Not since I first met Dominic. This was planned long before I came into the picture. Alpha Damian is using Dominic as a distraction. By making us think Dominic wants me, he’s keeping your focus off the real threat."

"He did kidnap you," Sebastian said slowly, still processing.

###Chapter 0207

"Yes, it is." My voice trembled slightly before ending the call.

Sophia tapped her fingers against the tablet screen. "I've got the logistics mapped out. Each van fits six, but we'll cram in eight or more depending on body size." She underlined each section with a sharp stroke. "If we secure three vans and Audrey sends reinforcements..."

"This is still going to take forever," I muttered, rubbing my temples. Sophia nodded and hit send, forwarding the list to Audrey.

"What now?" Sophia's question hung in the air like smoke.

I swallowed hard. "I need to mind-link the entire pack. Tell them to assemble at the packhouse entrance in twenty minutes." My stomach twisted—I'd never done this before.

"Right. Make sure you sound commanding. And urgent." Sophia's gaze bore into me, her worry palpable.

Closing my eyes, I steadied my breathing and expanded my consciousness, pushing my thoughts outward. "Attention, Silvercrest Pack!" My voice echoed through the mental link, sharper than I expected. "We are evacuating all women, children, and non-combatants. Report to the front of the packhouse immediately." A chorus of Yes, Luna reverberated back before I severed the connection.

"Did that work?" I asked, opening my eyes.

Sophia smirked. "Crystal clear."

"Then we should head down." My feet stayed rooted to the floor.

Sophia extended her hand. "I've got your back."

Grateful, I gripped her fingers and stepped into the hallway. Chaos erupted around us—shouts, hurried footsteps, the clatter of gear. Bodies jostled past as we navigated toward the foyer, the air thick with panic.

Then Sebastian's voice cut through the noise like a blade. "Listen up!" The sheer authority in his tone sent a shiver down my spine—I'd never heard him like this. "Check your gear twice. Hydrate now. Once we move, there won't be breaks."

We reached the foyer just as his gaze locked onto mine. A silent exchange passed between us before he continued barking orders. The warriors stood shoulder-to-shoulder, adjusting straps and smearing camouflage paint across their faces. Black combat gear made them look lethal, shadows ready to strike.

Sebastian broke away and stalked toward us. "What are you doing?"

"Organizing the evacuation groups," I said, my voice steadier than I felt. The pack's eyes weighed on me—some sympathetic, others assessing.

"Come with me." He seized my hand and pulled us onto the porch. Dressed in tactical blacks with streaks of paint across his sharp features, he looked every inch the warrior.

"I thought you weren't going." I studied his hardened expression.

"I'm not. But I'll be ready if things go sideways here." His gaze stayed fixed on the horizon, where figures already trudged toward us. "Four vans en route. No SUVs left."

"Expected as much."

"You're handling this well." He still wouldn't look at me.

"Except for the one thing we're both avoiding."

"Leave that to me. Just focus on the evacuation."

"Evelyn!" Amelia burst from the packhouse, her silver-streaked hair flying.

"Mother." Sebastian's jaw clenched.

"I'm here to help," she snapped, shooting him a glare.

Engines rumbled as the vans rolled up the drive. "Audrey's sending more. They're scouting the route for safety," I told Sebastian, ignoring Amelia.

"Good. That'll speed things up."

"Sophia, why don't you and Amelia start grouping people? Assign them waiting zones."

Sophia nodded and immediately began directing the arriving pack members.

The wind carried the scent of pine and impending rain. Somewhere beyond the trees, danger lurked—but right now, my pack needed me steady.

I squared my shoulders. Time to move.

###Chapter 0208

"Got it." More pack members were arriving, and handling things in small groups would be faster than waiting for everyone to gather.

"Tell me everything will go smoothly," I whispered to Sebastian. He released my hand and wrapped his arm around my shoulders instead.

"Better than smoothly."

"Sebastian." Alpha Benjamin's voice cut through the air, sharp with authority. Both Sebastian and I tensed.

"What?" Sebastian glanced around before spotting his father standing in the doorway.

"We need you inside." Without waiting for a response, Alpha Benjamin turned and strode back into the packhouse.

"We have to figure this out before lives are lost," I said through the mind-link.

"Agreed," Sebastian replied before following his father inside.

Turning back, I watched as Sophia and Luna Amelia organized the crowd. Some looked confused, others downright frightened. Children were being scolded for wandering off, and warriors moved in and out of the packhouse in steady streams. I wasn’t sure what they’d been told—whether by Sebastian or Alpha Benjamin—but every single one of them kept a careful distance from me.

It was equal parts frustrating and appreciated. Maybe if they treated me normally, I’d recover faster. Then again, maybe it would only make things worse.

Crossing my arms, I eased some of the weight off my shoulders. They still ached, but not as badly as this morning. Still, if I wanted to be treated like usual, I needed to act like my usual self.

That meant letting Sebastian do what he had to do to protect the pack.

Inside the packhouse, controlled chaos reigned. Warriors adjusted their gear, mates clung to them with tearful goodbyes, and some simply stood in silent determination. Sebastian stood in the far corner, deep in conversation with a group of men. His back was to me, but one of them noticed my presence and nudged him.

Sebastian turned, did a double take, then excused himself before striding over.

"Evelyn?" He pulled me aside. "What’s wrong?"

"Everyone’s avoiding me. No one will even look at me, let alone talk to me."

His brows furrowed. "I thought keeping distance would help you feel more comfortable. Evelyn, I’m swamped right now—"

"I know. Just listen." I grabbed his arm, maybe a little too firmly. His expression shifted, but I pressed on. "If I want to move forward, I need people to treat me like they did before. I need to feel normal in my own home. And normal means not clinging to you."

I held his gaze, making sure he understood. "If you need to be with our warriors, go. I’ll be fine. I’m a survivor. This won’t break me. If you need to leave… then leave."

His eyes softened. "I love you for saying that. And I’m glad you’re ready to find normal again. But someone has to stay here and keep things under control."

"We both know who that someone should be." I was talking about Oliver. Sophia was pregnant, and as composed as she seemed, Oliver would be a wreck worrying about her. He trusted Sebastian to protect her, but it wasn’t the same as being there himself.

"Are you sure?"

###Chapter 0209

"Positive. Go be the leader they need you to be." I released his arm, my fingers trailing up to his face. The movement sent a sharp twinge through my ribs, but I needed to memorize the feel of his skin beneath my fingertips—just in case.

Sebastian didn’t speak. Instead, he crushed his lips against mine in a desperate, bruising kiss. A farewell. My throat tightened, but I refused to let the tears fall. I was the damn Luna of this pack, and that meant holding myself together for our people. When he finally pulled away, his dark eyes locked onto mine.

"I love you, Evelyn."

"I love you too, Sebastian." My voice didn’t waver.

One last kiss, fleeting but fierce, and then he turned, striding toward his warriors—toward Oliver. I stayed back, watching the shock ripple across Oliver’s face before his gaze flicked to me. Sebastian walked past him without a word, leaving Oliver gaping in my direction.

"WARRIORS!" Sebastian’s roar cut through the murmurs. Silence fell instantly. Even I stilled. "Move out." His tone was lethal. A final glance my way, and then he was gone, the door slamming shut behind him.

The others followed without hesitation. I trailed after the last warrior, watching as they piled into the blacked-out SUVs. Sebastian waited until every door was sealed before climbing into his own. The entire pack seemed to hold its breath as the convoy rolled out of the territory.

Audrey’s vans arrived moments later. I stepped outside, the evening air cool against my skin, the sky deepening into twilight. I needed to brief them before loading up.

"Luna Evelyn. Good to see you." Wesley, one of my father’s best warriors, stepped forward. His daughter had been in my class years ago.

"Hey, how are you?" I stopped just out of arm’s reach.

"Shouldn’t I be asking you that?" His expression softened with sympathy.

"You know me—stubborn to a fault and allergic to help." I forced a smirk.

Wesley chuckled. "Some things never change."

"Any issues on the road?" I shifted to business.

"We took it slow. Audrey had us station warriors at intervals to monitor. Check-ins every ten minutes." He lifted a walkie-talkie. "No fresh tracks. No signs of hostiles."

"Good. You know how critical this is."

"Understood. I’ll greet Audrey personally. She got your message, but…" He hesitated.

"She still thinks I’m overreacting."

Wesley exhaled. "She’ll be a perfect Luna one day."

I swallowed the lump in my throat. "She already is."

"Sophia!" I called out. "Log every name and assign vehicles. Start loading now." Sophia nodded, directing families toward the vans. The pack moved swiftly, urgency in every step.

"Wesley," I lowered my voice, "we’ve kept details minimal to avoid panic. Keep it that way until everyone’s secure in Audrey’s safe house."

"Done." He checked his watch. "Grayson should rendezvous with Alpha Sebastian in five."

"Tell me I’m being paranoid."

He met my gaze. "You’re not paranoid. You’re protecting your pack. That’s your job."

I didn’t answer, just nodded as the last of the families approached his van. He swung the door open, revealing parents clutching children to their laps or settling them on the floor. Fear clung to them like a second skin.

"Everything will be okay," I promised, forcing calm into my voice. "Wesley will get you there safely."

The door clicked shut, sealing them inside.

###Chapter 0210

"Evelyn?" A mother's voice cut through the tension, urgent and trembling.

I turned to see her clutching her toddler, the little girl's tiny fingers gripping her mother's shirt like a lifeline. "Yes?"

"Where are we going?" Her eyes were wide with fear.

"You're being taken to Alpha Alexander and Alpha Grayson's pack. Grayson is my twin brother—it's where I grew up. Audrey, Grayson's mate, will meet you there and move you all to a secure location until we can ensure your safety here."

She didn't press further, just nodded and rocked her child gently. Wesley gave a firm nod and shut the van door.

"Here." Sophia approached me with a list in hand. We had managed to fit sixty-five people into the vans. It was cramped, but survival outweighed comfort.

Signing the paper, I passed it to Wesley. "Drive fast, but don’t take unnecessary risks."

He handed me a walkie-talkie. "I’ll update you when we arrive."

Stepping back, I watched as the vans sped off, disappearing into the night in the opposite direction.

The remaining pack members stood in uneasy silence, waiting for orders. "Thank you all for responding so quickly. The vans will return for another group soon. Rest while you can—it’ll be a while before they get back. If anyone needs food or water, let us know."

"Oliver?" Sophia’s whisper caught my attention.

I met her gaze. "Go to him. You need this more than I do."

Her hesitation lasted only a second before she broke into a run, throwing herself into his arms.

"That was kind of you," Amelia murmured, stepping beside me.

"It was necessary." My chest ached for Sebastian, but seeing Sophia’s relief eased some of the weight on my shoulders.

Minutes dragged by before the walkie-talkie crackled to life.

"Checkpoint one, all clear." Wesley’s voice was steady.

"Clarence, normal."

"Harrison, normal."

One by one, twelve more voices confirmed their status. Only when Wesley announced their arrival did I finally exhale.

Five more minutes passed as each pack member was accounted for before the vans turned back.

"First wave done," Amelia noted.

By the time the vans returned, darkness had swallowed the compound. Some children still played, their laughter a stark contrast to the tension in the air, while others had curled up to sleep. The pack had settled, oblivious to the danger lurking—exactly how I wanted it. They didn’t need fear until they were safe.

Sophia organized the next group. After signing off, the vans vanished into the night once more.

The distant hoot of an owl was the only sound in the eerie calm. Sophia and Oliver sat on the steps, staring at the stars, while warriors patrolled the perimeter.

"Oliver," I mind-linked him. "When’s the attack supposed to start?"

"Eleven."

My watch read 10:34. Twenty-six minutes left. They were probably out there now, hidden in shadows, waiting to strike.

"Did anyone ever search for the third tunnel?"

"No. We had to evacuate before we could look. And we don’t even know where to start." His logic didn’t ease the knot in my stomach. The darkness made searching impossible.

"Any word from Sebastian?"

"Not yet. I’ll tell you the second I hear anything." His gaze met mine, unreadable in the dim light. "How are you holding up?"

###Chapter 0211

"Ask me again when Sebastian returns."

The vans raced down the winding roads, each round trip taking approximately thirty-five minutes. Sophia had already loaded another group efficiently. Wesley gave me a quick nod before departing. Every pack member checked in precisely as instructed. With each successful evacuation, my tension eased slightly.

Yet my eyes kept darting to my watch every few minutes. The uncertainty gnawed at me like a persistent itch.

Luna Amelia appeared completely at ease, chatting casually with the remaining pack members. Every time the walkie-talkie crackled to life, my pulse quickened.

"Luna." Oliver's voice came from behind me as I stared into the inky forest.

"What?" I didn't turn around. He stepped beside me, maintaining careful distance but close enough that I could feel his presence.

"You're jumping at shadows," he observed. "Sebastian and the warriors will be fine. They'll complete the mission before anyone realizes what's happening."

My watch showed 10:59. Sophia was loading another group onto the vans. "I hope you're right."

"What else is troubling you?" Genuine concern colored Oliver's voice.

"We're missing something important."

"You think we're making a mistake?" He moved directly in front of me, lowering his voice.

"No, not exactly." I grasped his arm and led him further from the others. We spoke in hushed tones, knowing even wolf hearing had its limits. "What could Alpha Benjamin possess that would make Alpha Damian spend years planning this precise attack?"

Oliver's eyes darkened. "I don't know."

"Sebastian agrees. There's more to this, and until we understand what, we're still vulnerable."

"What do you propose?"

"You won't like it," I warned.

"Try me." Oliver crossed his arms. Across the clearing, Luna Amelia continued conversing with pack members.

"We search his office."



Twelve more men confirmed their safe arrival. I only breathed freely when Wesley finally radioed in. The verification process took about five minutes per group before they could return.

"First wave complete," Luna Amelia announced.

When the vans reappeared, darkness had fully descended. Some children still played while others had fallen asleep. Gradually, the pack's anxiety had eased - a luxury afforded by their ignorance of the true danger. Exactly as I intended. Their safety came first.

Sophia loaded another group onto the waiting vehicles. After signing the manifest, they departed again. Distant owl hoots punctuated the unnatural calm. Sophia and Oliver sat on the steps, gazing at the starry sky. Warriors patrolled the perimeter in steady rotations.

"Oliver, when was the attack scheduled?" I mind-linked.

"11pm," he responded. My watch read 10:34pm. Thirty minutes until their planned strike. Somewhere in that darkness, enemies waited for their moment.

"Did anyone search for the third tunnel?" I asked.

"No, they had to leave before investigating. We don't even have a starting point." Though Oliver spoke rationally, the unknown still clawed at me. The darkness made proper reconnaissance impossible.

"Any word from Sebastian?"

"Not yet. I'll update you immediately." I glanced over. He watched me, his features obscured by shadows. "How are you holding up?"

###Chapter 0212
"Not too much. I'll start with the filing cabinet." Oliver said. The rusty hinges screeched as he pulled it open. "He's got a file for every ranking pack member in here."

That didn't shock me completely, but it was unsettling. Most alphas kept records, but this felt excessive. "That's not entirely unusual," I said hesitantly.

"Your file has copies of IQ tests you took as a child."

"WHAT?" My stomach dropped.

"Yeah, looks like one from when you were seven." Oliver confirmed. He wasn't wrong—I remembered that test.

"What else is in there?"

"Your family tree, positions, lineage details—the works."

"And he just... kept this in a locked cabinet?" I clarified, my voice tight.

"It was secured. Your folder isn't anything special, just basic intel." Oliver sounded like he was flipping through pages before setting it back.

"We don’t have forever. Keep searching," I urged.

"Found one on Alpha Damian." Oliver said after a beat.

My pulse spiked. "What's in it?"

"Family tree, but some names are redacted."

"Take a photo. Now."

"He knows everything—pack numbers, territory size, even the patrol rotations. Damn. He’s got their entire security mapped out."

"You're kidding." My blood ran cold. "He'd need a mole for that kind of intel."

"No joke. No dates, though. No way to tell how long he's had this." Oliver muttered, more to himself than me.

The vans rolled up again, right on schedule. The pack stood, waiting for them to park. We were nearing the end, and relief washed over me. Sophia helped them inside, signed the papers, and the vans drove off.

She returned to the steps, and Luna Amelia sat beside her. My heart lurched.

"I'll explain later."



"Okay." Sophia asked Luna Amelia about the plans for my ceremony, sparking an animated discussion.

"Find anything else?" I pressed Oliver.

"Took photos of some budget sheets, but nothing jumps out. His computer's locked, and it's powered down—no way in."

Frustration prickled. "Check the floor. Any hidden compartments? Trapdoors?"

Silence. Then shuffling. "Looking, but... nothing obvious," Oliver finally said.

Luna Amelia stood. Sophia's gaze flicked to me. "Get out! Oliver, get out now!"

"Shit!" Oliver hissed—then a thud, a groan. The door clicked shut just as Luna Amelia stepped inside.

"Oh! Oliver! You startled me!" He'd barely managed to intercept her before she closed the packhouse door.

"My apologies, Luna Amelia. Just used the restroom."

"You were in there a while. Everything alright?" Oliver kept the mind-link open, so I heard everything.

"Stomach's off. Lunch didn’t agree with me."

"Is that why Sebastian switched with you?" Luna Amelia asked.

"Yeah. Didn’t want to risk an... accident out there." Oliver was taking one for the team.

"Nothing to do with Evelyn telling Sebastian to leave you behind?" Oh, hell.

"What are you implying, Luna? That I was too scared to go?" Oliver's tone turned sharp.

"Oh no, just curious about the switch. Evelyn’s emotionally fragile right now. I’m concerned for her."

###Chapter 0213

"Oh, I think Evelyn Andrews is coping remarkably well with her trauma. She's still out here, doing everything necessary for our pack. She's not thinking about herself right now, and that speaks volumes about her bravery." Oliver defended me.

"Suppressing trauma isn't healthy either," Luna Amelia murmured. "She's been pacing nonstop and jumping at every little sound."

"Can you blame her? Anyone would react that way after being kidnapped. You heard the recording."

"Yes, I did... Just keep a close eye on her, will you?" Luna Amelia's voice faded as if she were walking away.

Oliver stepped outside, shutting the door behind him as the vans circled back. He approached me while Sophia stood and began loading the vehicles again. His gaze lingered, but he remained silent. Together, we watched as the last group climbed in. One final load remained, and still, we hadn't received any updates. Oliver checked his phone. Nothing. I wasn’t sure if that was good or bad.

"How long was the mission supposed to take?" I asked as the vans disappeared down the road.

"Hard to say. Depends on whether they ran into complications."

"And if everything went smoothly?"

"Maybe thirty minutes to an hour. We didn’t know the full layout or what they’d find inside. Plans might’ve shifted."

"Grayson went with them," I stated.

"Yes." Oliver glanced at me.

"And my father..."

"Yes."

"So Nathan is overseeing the pack there?"

"Along with most of their warriors," Oliver sighed.

"Are you sending Sophia with the last group?" I looked up at him.

Oliver studied me intently. "What about me?" Sophia slipped under his arm, pressing close.



"Evelyn was asking if you’d be going with the last group," Oliver explained.

"Oh!" Sophia blinked in surprise.

"I wasn’t sure if you’d feel safer there. Given everything, I wouldn’t blame you for wanting to go. It might help our pack adjust, seeing a familiar face."

"Do you think I should?" Sophia tilted her head up at him.

"I want you safe. Our baby safe." Oliver hesitated before answering.

"We don’t even know how long they’ll be gone," Sophia murmured. "I could be away from you for days—weeks, even!"

"I doubt it’ll be that long, but I could visit," I assured her.

"Maybe it’s not a bad idea," Oliver conceded.

"I’ll give you two some privacy to talk." I stepped away, needing to sit. My shoulders ached, my feet throbbed. Sinking onto the porch steps, I stared blankly at the stars until the rumble of returning vans snapped me from my daze.

Standing, I watched as the remaining pack members boarded. Oliver guided Sophia to the front seat beside Wesley. Once everyone was settled, he shut the doors.

"Is that everyone?" Wesley asked.

"I believe so. Thank you for doing this," I said.

"My pleasure. Smooth sailing so far. One last trip, and we're done. Alpha Grayson can collect the walkie-talkie later so you’ll know we arrived safely."

"Thank you," I said as Wesley took the driver’s seat.

"Stay safe!" Sophia leaned forward, calling out to me.

"You too." I gave a small wave, stepping back as the vans vanished into the night for the final time.

"This sucks," Oliver muttered, hands on his hips.

"Agreed." Turning, I climbed the stairs and sank onto the porch swing. Oliver followed but hesitated before sitting beside me.

###Chapter 0214

"Not sleeping?"

I arched an eyebrow at Oliver, swinging gently on the porch swing. The question felt redundant.

"Are you planning to?" I countered.

He exhaled, rubbing the back of his neck. "Guess not."

Oliver glanced at the empty space beside me. I stopped the swing, shifting over just enough to give him room—close, but not touching.

"Still no word?" I asked, though I already knew.

"Nope."

Silence settled between us, comfortable and heavy. One by one, warriors drifted onto the porch, taking seats without a word. No one would sleep tonight—not until they returned. The night hummed with the chorus of frogs and the distant hoot of an owl.

At some point, I leaned my head against the chain, eyes slipping shut. My mind wandered to my tattoo shop—the one I’d lost. Missing it didn’t even begin to cover it. That place had been my sanctuary, my purpose.

Then, like a jolt of electricity, my wolf surged back to life inside me. My body thrummed with renewed energy, sharper, more alive—

"Evelyn." Oliver nudged my leg.

My eyes snapped open. "What?"

He jerked his chin toward the road.

Engines.

My neck cracked as I whipped my head around. There they were—our black SUVs rolling up the driveway. The warriors rose, but I was already moving, sprinting to the top of the stairs.

Doors swung open. Men stepped out.

No blood. No bodies. No tears.

Then—green.

The most breathtaking shade of emerald locked onto me. Sebastian slid out of the passenger seat, his gaze searing through the distance between us. Relief hit me like a tidal wave. I sucked in a sharp breath, steadying myself as he rounded the SUV.

I didn’t wait.

I flew down the stairs and crashed into his arms.

His grip was crushing—one arm banded around my shoulders, the other cradling my head. His lips pressed against my forehead, once, twice, before he rested his cheek against mine. The pressure bordered on painful, but I didn’t care. Sparks danced across my skin, erasing every shred of fear. My fingers twisted into his shirt, clinging like he was the only thing anchoring me to this world.

Because he was.

My rock. My soul.



"Well?" a warrior called out.

"Flawless." Alpha Benjamin’s voice rang with triumph. "They never saw it coming."

The pack erupted—cheers, howls, the raw energy of victory. My chest swelled with gratitude.

"Oliver." Sebastian’s voice was rough.

"All good, man." Oliver stepped forward, and I felt Sebastian release me just enough to clasp his hand.

"Thank you." The weight behind those words was unmistakable.

"Anytime." Oliver started to turn away.

"Oliver?" I peeked around Sebastian’s arm.

He paused. "Yeah?"

"Come to our room."

No explanation. Just the unspoken understanding between us. Sebastian tensed slightly, but to his credit, he didn’t question it.

Oliver studied me for a beat before nodding. He grabbed Sebastian’s bag, and Sebastian kept me tucked against his side as we followed him inside.

The packhouse was quiet, warriors dispersing to their rooms. We didn’t speak until our door was locked behind us.

Sebastian guided me to the couch, his brow furrowed. "What’s going on?"

I looked at Oliver. "Show him."

###Chapter 0215

Sebastian pulled his shirt off and tossed it carelessly into the corner. Oliver sighed and took a seat, rubbing his temples as if bracing for impact.

"First of all, it was Evelyn's idea," Oliver admitted, raising his hands in surrender. "I just followed orders."

Sebastian frowned, disappearing into the closet. The rustle of fabric told me he was changing. Moments later, he emerged in shorts, brushing past us to splash water on his face in the bathroom.

Only when he returned did he finally acknowledge us. "What happened?" His voice was low as he sat beside me, pulling me tightly against his side.

I swallowed. "I kept thinking about what your father might be hiding..." Suddenly, the confession felt reckless.

Sebastian's gaze dropped to me. "And?"

"The compound was empty. All the warriors were with you, so I had Oliver search your father's office." I glanced at Oliver for backup.

"She made me look for anything suspicious," Oliver added quickly.

Sebastian's eyes flicked between us, shock flashing across his face. "You what?"

"We both know he's hiding something," I said firmly. "Your mother was acting strange too. I saw an opening and took it."

Sebastian fell silent, his emotions a turbulent mix—anger, confusion, disbelief, and... was that a flicker of pride? "Did you find anything?"

Oliver nodded, pulling out his phone. He swiped to a photo and handed it over. Sebastian leaned forward, his body going rigid as he read. He flipped through several images before locking eyes with me.

"Does your father have a spy in Alpha Theodore's pack?" I asked bluntly.

Sebastian exhaled sharply, looking back at the screen. "I don't know."

"What happened tonight?" Oliver pressed. "Why wasn’t there more celebration? The mood was... off."

Sebastian's jaw tightened. "Because something wasn’t right. The building was deserted. No guards, no security—just dust everywhere, like it had been abandoned for weeks. We planted the explosives and left. They detonated as planned, but... it felt like a setup."

"That’s strange for a place that’s supposed to be their main revenue source," Oliver muttered.

"Was the intel wrong?" I asked.

Sebastian stood abruptly, pacing. "My father never gave me access to the details. I just trusted his word."

"Maybe my father or Grayson would know," I suggested, glancing at Oliver.

"Possibly," Oliver agreed. "Or maybe Alpha Benjamin was given bad information."

Sebastian stopped mid-step. "Who else knows about this?"

"Just us," I said quickly.

Sebastian tossed the phone back to Oliver. "Where’s Sophia?"

"She went with the others to my father’s pack as a precaution," I answered quietly.

Sebastian nodded, his hands on his hips as he stared at the wall behind us. I couldn’t tell if he was furious or just processing. "Oliver, get some rest. We’ll talk more in the morning."

Oliver and I exchanged a look before he stood. "Alright."

Sebastian shook his hand before seeing him out. The moment the door clicked shut, Sebastian locked it and leaned his forehead against the wood, his breathing uneven.

"I’m sorry if I crossed a line," I murmured when he didn’t return to me.

Sebastian pushed off the door and stalked toward me. I held my ground—I wasn’t sorry for what I’d done. "What if you’d been caught?"

"Then I’d have stood my ground, just like I always do," I said simply.

Sebastian sat on the opposite end of the couch, facing me but keeping his distance. "We have to be careful now. If my father suspects we’re onto him, he’ll cover his tracks. And if you’d been caught..." He shook his head, looking away.

The weight of the unspoken consequences hung heavy between us.

###Chapter 0216

"That's probably why he was so insistent on us taking a vacation and staying out of his business," I muttered, deliberately ignoring the last part of what Sebastian had said.

"Something about this whole situation doesn't sit right with me. I don’t think we made the impact we intended." Sebastian sighed, sinking onto the couch beside me before pulling me against him.

"Tomorrow, we need to locate the third tunnel. They all need to be sealed off completely."

"I agree. I’ve set up surveillance in case anyone tries to use them." Sebastian shifted, lifting me onto his lap before standing effortlessly. He carried me to our bed, laying me down gently before rolling onto his side beside me. "How are you feeling?"

"Sore, but I’ll live," I admitted, nestling into his chest. His arms wrapped around me, holding me close, and only then did I finally let my body relax against his. His fingers traced soothing circles along my back as I closed my eyes.

"Sleep, my love," he murmured against my ear. The warmth of his voice was all I needed to surrender to the quiet embrace of sleep.

The next morning, the insistent buzzing of his phone jolted us awake. My entire body was sprawled across his, my head resting on his chest while his arms were folded behind his head. Mine were draped lazily over him, and the sheer comfort of the position made me reluctant to move.

Sebastian shifted carefully, trying not to disturb me as he checked the message. Despite my reluctance, I slid off him to give him space.

"Where are you going?" His hand clamped around my thigh, stopping me from getting up.

"Bathroom," I said, glancing back at him. He nodded, releasing me.

My shoulders felt significantly better—I could lift them over my head with only minor stiffness. Thank the Moon Goddess for accelerated wolf healing.

After freshening up, I peeled off my shirt and examined myself in the mirror. The bruises were still vivid, but they had faded to sickly greens and yellows, some even disappearing entirely. Deciding a hot shower would ease the lingering soreness, I stepped under the spray.

The bathroom door creaked open seconds later.

"Starting without me?" Sebastian’s voice was thick with sleep.

"Spur-of-the-moment decision. Thought the heat might help loosen me up."

Sebastian slipped in behind me, his hands immediately finding my hips. He turned me to face him, his gaze sweeping over me with possessive warmth.

"That would be strange for a building that’s supposedly a major revenue source for them," Oliver mused, frowning.

"Was the intel wrong?" I asked.

"My father never gave me access to those records. I only ever had his word to go by," Sebastian admitted, standing and pacing.

"Maybe my father would know. Or Grayson," I suggested, glancing at Oliver.

"Possibly. Or maybe Alpha Benjamin was misinformed," Oliver offered, playing devil’s advocate.

"Who else knows about this?" Sebastian asked sharply.

"Just the three of us," I answered quickly. Sebastian tossed his phone to Oliver.

"Where’s Sophia?"

"She went with the rest of the pack to my father’s territory, as a precaution in case we were attacked here," I said quietly.

Sebastian nodded, his hands on his hips as he stared at something behind us. I couldn’t tell if he was angry with me or just processing.

"Oliver, get some rest. We’ll regroup in the morning."

Oliver and I exchanged a look before he stood. "Alright."

Sebastian extended a hand for a firm shake before following Oliver out. Once the door clicked shut, he locked it and leaned his forehead against the wood, visibly wrestling with his temper.

"I’m sorry if I overstepped," I said softly when he didn’t return to me.

Sebastian pushed off the door and strode toward me. I held my ground, unapologetic for my actions.

"What if you’d been caught?"

"Then I’d have fought back, just like I have this entire time," I said simply as he sat on the opposite end of the couch. He faced me but didn’t reach out.

"We need to be smarter moving forward. The fact that you questioned my father in our office means he knows we’re suspicious. If he’s hiding something, he’ll cover his tracks now. And if you’d been caught—" Sebastian cut himself off, shaking his head as he looked away.

###Chapter 0217

"Not this way." Sebastian growled, pulling my head away from his throbbing length.

The shower water stopped abruptly as he lifted me effortlessly, carrying me to the bed. Droplets still clung to our skin, but it didn't deter him from laying me down with surprising tenderness. My legs instinctively wrapped around his waist as his lips crashed against mine, his body trembling above me.

"I'm fine," I whispered when he broke the kiss. His forehead pressed against mine, but the heat of his arousal pressed insistently between my thighs, making my body ache for him.

"Are you certain? If it's too soon—" Sebastian's words were cut off as I seized his face and kissed him fiercely.

Guiding his hand to my breast, I held his gaze. "Touch me, Sebastian. I need you to make love to me. I need to feel you." His eyes searched mine briefly before his lips trailed down my neck. His fingers worked magic, sending shivers of desire through me. His tongue traced lower, lavishing attention on every inch of my skin before finding the sensitive spot beneath my breast. My back arched off the bed as his hair became my anchor, my fingers tangling in it as he moved lower.

Instinct took over as my legs parted wider, his lips brushing my inner thigh. I sensed his hesitation before his tongue flicked lightly over my core. His claws dug into my hips as I rocked against his mouth.

A single finger slid inside me, drawing a gasp as wetness coated his hand.

"Oh, Sebastian!" I moaned as he added another finger, his pace quickening. Between his tongue and his fingers, I was unraveling. My body trembled with need, pressure coiling tighter. My face tingled, but my eyes never left his.

"Come for me," he commanded, just as my climax shattered through me. My hips bucked wildly as my head fell back.

"Ah! Yes!" I cried out, his relentless rhythm prolonging my pleasure.

As the waves subsided, Sebastian withdrew his fingers and moved up, his lips claiming mine as he sheathed himself inside me in one smooth thrust. He filled me completely, pulling out slowly before pushing back in, our kiss never breaking.

Feeling bold, I pushed him onto his back and straddled him, taking control. His hands settled on my hips as I ground against him, his gaze locked on where our bodies joined. My movements grew faster, and his eyes rolled back in ecstasy. My fangs descended, and without hesitation, I leaned forward and sank them into his neck.

His body tensed beneath me, claws gripping my hips as his own release surged into me. The moment my teeth retracted, he flipped me over and drove into me with renewed intensity. His fangs grazed my skin, but he held back, focusing solely on claiming me.



"A little stiff, but not painful. Like muscles that haven't been used in a while. Which reminds me, I haven’t worked out in weeks."

"Let’s wait till Monday. You should feel normal by then." Sebastian grabbed the shampoo, lathering it into my hair.

"Mmm, that feels amazing," I purred, my hands resting on his hips.

"Don’t even think about it," he sighed, though amusement laced his voice.

"Think about what?" I feigned innocence, pressing my body against his, my hardened nipples grazing his chest.

"You’re not ready yet," he muttered, pushing me under the water again.

"I’m ready for you," I admitted honestly. I craved his touch, needed to feel his love.

Sebastian reached for the conditioner, working it through my strands while I took the body wash, slicking my hands over both of us. I lingered on him, ensuring his scent clung to my skin. The soap made it easy to wrap my fingers around his length, stroking him slowly.

"F*ck, Evelyn," he groaned, his eyes closing as he leaned back against the tiles. He dunked his head under the water, rinsing his hair while I washed out the conditioner. We switched places, giving me full access to him again.

With his eyes still shut, I sank to my knees and took him into my mouth. The moment my lips closed around him, his entire body jerked, his hand slamming against the wall for support. His eyes flew open, dark with hunger, but he didn’t speak—just watched as I moved over him, his grip tightening in my hair.

###Chapter 0218

"Maybe we should take a vacation where we never have to leave the bed," I groaned, pushing myself up with my arms. My muscles ached as I shuffled toward the bathroom, desperate to wash away the lingering exhaustion.

Sebastian's voice carried from the closet, laced with amusement. "I wouldn't say no to that."

As I turned the corner, he emerged, already dressed in simple gym shorts and a fitted tank. Not exactly formal attire, but then again, the only people here were warriors. I rummaged through my drawer, pulling out a workout top with a built-in bra and matching shorts. The bottoms were easy enough, but the top—specifically the snug sports bra—was another story.

"Need help?" I asked, struggling to adjust it properly.

Sebastian smirked as he stepped closer, his fingers deftly fixing the straps before giving my backside a playful smack. "Showing off your battle scars?" He tossed me a pair of socks.

"Might as well. I'm embracing them," I said, though my attempt at confidence wavered.

"Did your wolf come back yet?" he asked, watching as I laced up my sneakers.

"Last night," I admitted. "Right before you got home, actually."

"Good. Then you should be fully healed by tonight." His smile was reassuring.

"I hope so. I'm tired of feeling like I got hit by a truck."

Sebastian opened the bedroom door, pausing to give me a knowing look. "I wouldn't count on 'normal' for a while."

I shot him a glare as I walked past, refusing to slow down for him. He caught up easily, his tone turning serious. "Tomorrow's going to be rough. And whatever comes after that..."

Right. Tomorrow. I had almost forgotten. What would my father say? Would he be proud? Angry? Maybe it would finally be the thing that took Margaret down for good.

"Sebastian!" Alpha Benjamin's voice boomed from his office as we passed. We both stopped, exchanging a glance before stepping inside. Luna Amelia and a few warriors were gathered around the TV, where a news report played.

"Turn it up," Sebastian ordered, crossing his arms.

The reporter's voice filled the room.

"...just after 11 PM, witnesses reported hearing an explosion before the ground shook. The building, belonging to Midnight Mechanics, was completely destroyed. The owner, Theodore Blackwood, has yet to comment. Fire crews have been battling the blaze since their arrival at 11:35 PM and have only just contained it. No casualties have been reported, and the cause remains unknown. This is Evelyn Carter, reporting for Channel 15."

I glanced at Sebastian. His expression was dark, a mix of fury and frustration. Silence stretched between us all. It didn’t feel like enough. The destruction, the fire—was it even a dent in their operation?

Alpha Benjamin's phone rang. He exhaled sharply before answering, putting it on speaker.

"What the hell was that, Benjamin?" My father's voice crackled through the line.

"Every lead we had pointed to that place being their main source of income," Benjamin snapped, his anger not directed at my father but at the situation.

"Who the hell gave you that intel? I trusted you to make them pay for what they did to my daughter. Do I need to step in?" A few warriors shifted uncomfortably, their eyes flicking to me.

"This isn't over," Benjamin growled.

"It better not be. Because if you're just wasting my time, I'll handle it myself." The threat in my father's voice was unmistakable.

Benjamin's jaw clenched. "She's under my protection now. The decision is mine."

The tension in the room thickened.

This wasn't just about revenge anymore.

It was about control.

###Chapter 0219

"And while she's been with your pack, she's been kidnapped, shot at, and had her privacy violated." That was a harsh truth, but I couldn't deny it. "You have one damn hour to tell me how you plan to fix this! I want to speak to her—now!"

"I'm here, Dad," I said firmly, raising my voice just enough to sound confident.

"Evelyn? Has your wolf returned?"

"She has," I confirmed.

"Good. We'll make sure they pay for what they did to you. Even if it's the last thing I do." Dad spat the words before hanging up. The final part left me unsettled. Glancing at Sebastian, we both understood—he didn’t expect to survive this. Sebastian looked just as confused as I felt.

"Warriors, let's find that other tunnel. Alpha Benjamin clearly has some explaining to do." Sebastian’s voice dripped with venom. His glare could have burned holes into Alpha Benjamin before he turned and stormed out. I had to jog to keep up. The warriors followed in tense silence, their disapproval thick in the air.

Sebastian marched into the forest like a man possessed. I wasn’t even sure he knew where he was going. "Sebastian?" I called softly.

"What?" he snapped through gritted teeth.

"Where are we going?" I asked bluntly.

He stopped so abruptly that I crashed into him, stumbling over a log. He grabbed my arm to steady me, yanking me upright. "Damn it!" I hissed, jerking my arm back and cradling it against my chest.

"Shit," Sebastian muttered, stepping toward me.

"No." I held up a finger. "You're going the wrong damn way." I shot him a glare, turned left, and strode off.

I could feel his regret, but I also caught the muffled laughter from the warriors at his expense. Anger was a welcome feeling—it made me feel like myself again. Still, I stayed silent as we moved toward the tunnel marked on the map.

"Spread out. Look for anything unusual," Sebastian ordered. The warriors obeyed instantly, kicking through the undergrowth.

"Evelyn!" Oliver's voice cut through the tension as he sprinted to catch up.

"...Last night around 11 PM, witnesses reported hearing an explosion before the ground shook. The business, Midnight Mechanics, was completely destroyed. The owner, Theodore Thomas, was unavailable for comment. Fire crews have been battling the blaze since arriving at 11:35 PM and only just contained it. The cause remains unknown, but thankfully, no injuries were reported. Alexis Grey, Channel 15 News."

I looked up at Sebastian. His expression was a mix of fury and grim satisfaction. No one spoke for a long moment. It didn’t feel like enough. Was this even a real blow to them?

Alpha Benjamin's phone rang. "Alpha Benjamin," he answered wearily before putting it on speaker.

"What the hell was that, Benjamin?" My father's voice crackled through.

"Our intel said that was their main revenue stream," Alpha Benjamin growled, frustration clear in his tone—not at Dad, but at the situation.

"Who the hell was your source? I trusted you to avenge my daughter. Do I need to step in?" Some of the warriors glanced my way.

"This isn't over," Alpha Benjamin snarled.

"This is the last time I trust your intel blindly. You're making a mockery of this, and I won’t stand for it!" I watched as Alpha Benjamin seemed to unravel.

"She's in my pack, and the decision is mine!" Alpha Benjamin shouted.

###Chapter 0220


"Oliver, be ready." My voice was barely above a whisper, but the men around us stiffened immediately, their postures shifting into defensive stances.

Sebastian snatched the phone from my hand, his eyes darkening to pitch black in an instant. I quickly reclaimed the device and tossed it back to Oliver, my focus locked on Sebastian.

"Sebastian! Look at me!" I gripped his shoulder, shaking him hard, but his attention was elsewhere, his wolf dangerously close to the surface.

"Luna! Get back!" Several warriors shouted in warning.

SMACK!

My palm connected with Sebastian's cheek with enough force to send him stumbling backward. Pain shot up my arm, sharp and stinging, but I barely registered it. My shoulder sagged slightly from the impact.

His gaze snapped to mine. For a heartbeat, he didn’t react—then recognition flickered in his eyes. I watched as he wrestled control back from his wolf, his jaw clenching. He squeezed his eyes shut, and someone seized my arms, yanking me away.

Sebastian’s eyes flew open, a feral snarl ripping from his throat as he glared at the warrior holding me. "Don’t. Touch. Her." His voice was a lethal growl.

"Sebastian!" I stomped my foot, demanding his attention. "Get a grip!"

"THIS IS BULLSHIT! I’LL TEAR HIM APART!" His roar shook the air.

"No, you won’t!" I marched forward and grabbed his arm. He didn’t push me away, but his entire body was rigid with tension. "We need to think, not just react. We don’t have all the pieces yet."

"They took you!" Sebastian snarled, stepping back, his chest heaving. "They hurt you. And what did we do? Blow up a goddamn empty building! That’s not justice!"

"I know what they did," I said coldly. "And I want them dead too. But we can’t just charge in blindly. This isn’t just about me—you were shot, Liam was killed. This is bigger than revenge. Theodore is planning something, and we need to be ready. Alpha Benjamin isn’t handling this. It’s time you stepped up."

My wolf surged forward, my voice ringing with authority. The warriors around us nodded in agreement. "Luna’s right!" one of them called out.

"We start by finding that third tunnel. Everyone, spread out—now!" I barked, locking eyes with Sebastian. He was staring at me, his breathing ragged as he fought for control.

Oliver, I mind-linked him. Send Sebastian those pictures.



A tense silence stretched before Sebastian finally spoke. "Oliver." His voice was eerily calm. "Evelyn and I need to speak with my father. Keep me updated on the search."

"Got it," Oliver replied, far too cheerful for the situation, before we turned and headed back toward the pack house.

Only when we were out of earshot did Sebastian finally speak. "I’m sorry."

"It’s fine," I muttered, refusing to look at him.

"It’s not." His hand shot out, gripping my waist and forcing me to face him. "Evelyn, I’m sorry."

"Sorry for what?" I crossed my arms, shifting my weight.

"For my father failing you. For losing control back there. For any of this happening to you." He shook his head, frustration etched into every line of his face.

"We’re in this together," I said firmly. "The past doesn’t matter. What matters is protecting our future. And right now, that starts with your father."

The moment the words left my mouth, Sebastian’s eyes flickered black before returning to their usual emerald green. "Come on," he said, taking my hand as we strode toward Alpha Benjamin’s office.

###Chapter 0221

"FATHER!" Sebastian's furious roar shattered the office silence as he kicked open the door. My breath caught seeing my dad seated behind his desk.

"Dad?" My voice trembled with confusion.

"Evelyn." Dad rose immediately, embracing me. His flushed face and the tension in the room told me they'd been arguing fiercely.

"This is a private meeting, Sebastian." Alpha Benjamin's voice carried dangerous authority.

"No more secrets." Sebastian's knuckles turned white as he slammed them onto the mahogany desk. "I won't stand by while you jeopardize our pack and my mate. Whatever game you're playing ends now."

My father released me, stepping between the two alphas. The air crackled with barely contained rage. "Explain this."

"Audrey and Sophia discovered that mechanical shop was just an empty shell being sold online." Sebastian's voice dripped with accusation. "That entire attack was pointless! Not only did we fail to avenge Evelyn, but we lost our advantage. Now they know we're coming."

"All intelligence confirmed that building was operational!" Benjamin's roar shook the windows.

"Then your sources are worthless." Sebastian spat back. "Who's feeding you this garbage?"

"That's classified." The alpha's voice dropped to a lethal whisper.

"You claimed the phone traced to that location." I edged closer, still shielded by Sebastian's broad frame. "Why were you watching them?"

"Enemies deserve surveillance." Benjamin dismissed my question with a wave.

My pulse quickened. "Where's Gamma Elliott?"

The alpha's entire body stiffened before forcing relaxation. Neither Sebastian nor my father missed the reaction. "On assignment."

"Is he infiltrating Alpha Damian's pack?" Sebastian's blunt question hung in the air.

Benjamin's face darkened. "What makes you ask that?"

Without hesitation, Sebastian produced his phone, displaying the damning photo Oliver had sent. "Where did—"

"Oliver." Sebastian finally answered after a tense silence. "Evelyn and I need to speak with my father privately. Keep me posted."

"Understood." Oliver's unusually cheerful reply followed us as we retreated toward the pack house.

Only when we were beyond earshot did Sebastian speak. "I'm sorry."

"It's fine." I avoided his gaze.

"It's not." His strong hands gripped my waist, forcing me to face him. "Evelyn, I mean it."

"Sorry for what exactly?" I crossed my arms, shifting my weight.

"For my father's failure. For losing control back there. For dragging you into this nightmare." He shook his head, shadows dancing in his emerald eyes.

"We're partners in this." I reached for his hand. "The past doesn't matter - only protecting our future. And right now, that starts with your father."

As I spoke, Sebastian's eyes flickered obsidian before returning to their usual green. "Come on." His fingers intertwined with mine as we marched back toward Benjamin's office.

###Chapter 0222

"We found the tunnel." Oliver's voice echoed through the mind-link.

"What?" Nathan's brows furrowed as the room fell silent.

"They discovered a third tunnel," Evelyn clarified for her father.

"Benjamin, I strongly suggest you consider stepping down. No—I insist you step down before this blows up in your face." Nathan's piercing gaze locked onto Alpha Benjamin.

"And what about you? Handing everything over to your precious son?" Benjamin spat, his tone dripping with venom.

"Without hesitation," Nathan replied smoothly, his eyes flickering toward Grayson before returning to Benjamin. "What's the next move, Sebastian?"

"We extract Elliott. Every piece of intel we have is compromised now. We need to regroup, strategize, and shut these tunnels down. By Monday, our people should be able to return home."

"Good." Nathan gave a firm nod.

"Have Audrey and Sophia do their thing—see what they uncover when we visit tomorrow," Evelyn added.

Nathan pulled her into a tight embrace. "Do you need to come home with me?"

"No. I'm fine staying here to clean up this mess." She hugged him one last time before he turned away.

"From this moment on, Benjamin, I will no longer communicate with you. All dealings will go through Sebastian or Grayson. My alliance is with them now." Nathan didn’t wait for a response. He strode out of the office, his footsteps echoing through the packhouse.

"You have until tonight to make the right decision. I will be sealing those tunnels." Sebastian's voice was steel as he turned, gripping Evelyn's arm and guiding her out.

They didn’t bother closing the door behind them. The forest swallowed them whole, the tension between them thick and unspoken.

"Alpha!" A warrior's shout cut through the silence.

Sebastian's jaw clenched. "Where is it?"

One of the warriors pulled aside a thick layer of underbrush, revealing a wooden hatch embedded in the ground. Just like the others—dark, foreboding, a gaping maw into the unknown.



"From my own sources, that man beside Elliott? We believe he might be Audrey’s father," Sebastian revealed.

Nathan's face darkened, his fury barely contained. "Explain yourself."

"Yes, I sent Elliott undercover! I knew Theodore would become a problem, and I wanted every scrap of intel I could get on him."

"How long has he been in there?" Nathan demanded.

"Nine months!" Benjamin dragged a hand through his hair.

"NINE MONTHS?" Sebastian's roar shook the trees. "You risked your Gamma’s life for nine fucking months? What about his family? His mate? His life? If they broke him, he could’ve been feeding you lies this whole time! He could’ve been tortured daily!"

"When was the last time you spoke to him?" Nathan's palms pressed flat against the desk, his voice dangerously low.

"Texts. Updates. His code word." Benjamin's voice wavered.

"They could’ve forced him to send those!" Sebastian's fist crashed through the wall.

"What else are you hiding?" Evelyn cut in as Benjamin opened his mouth to retaliate. His glare sharpened on her.

"Excuse me? Who the hell do you think you—"

"Answer the damn question, Father." Sebastian stepped between them, shielding Evelyn.

"I don’t know what you're talking about," Benjamin muttered, turning toward the window.

"You do," Sebastian growled. "It's time your secrets came to light. Evelyn told you about the tunnels. Why has Theodore been targeting us for years? Why did you plant a spy in his territory?" His arms crossed, unyielding.

###Chapter 0223

"Why did he let things spiral out of control like this?" Sebastian's question was more to himself than to me.

"As messed up as this entire situation is, I don't think your father intended for it to go this far."

"What are you implying?" Sebastian's gaze dropped to meet mine.

"Sebastian, you're a man of integrity. You know right from wrong—you're strong, loyal, and you fight for what's just, not what's easy. The man who raised you shaped you into who you are today. I don't believe this started with the intention of becoming this disastrous. I think your father got tangled in something, and it snowballed beyond his control. He's probably drowning in shame and embarrassment but doesn’t know how to escape it. Does he need to step down? Absolutely. He’s so desperate for everything to work out that he’s blind to the real danger."

"I hope you're right. But I’m warning you now—if we uncover something unforgivable in what he’s hiding..." Sebastian shook his head, struggling to voice the rest. "...I’ll challenge him on the spot."

As much as I hated the idea, part of me feared that might be the only way to strip him of power. A man spiraling out of control was dangerous. "I understand."

We sat in silence until the sun climbed high in the sky. "I should check on my men," Sebastian finally said with a sigh.

"I’ll go prepare lunch for everyone. I’ll mind-link you when it’s ready."

Sebastian stood and offered me his hand.

Taking it, he pulled me close and kissed me. "That’s thoughtful of you."

"I can’t promise anything gourmet—I haven’t even seen the kitchen yet—but I’ll do my best," I assured him as we stepped into the sunlight.

"Doesn’t have to be fancy. Just enough to keep us going." He released my hand as we headed in opposite directions.

"Stay safe," I called after him.

"You too."

Entering the packhouse, it hadn’t even crossed my mind that Alpha Benjamin might still be inside. I hadn’t seen Luna Amelia today either, though that wasn’t unusual. Still, wanting to avoid him, I beelined straight for the kitchen and shut the door behind me.



Opening the fridge, I scanned the overflowing shelves—clearly, someone had just restocked. After some deliberation, I decided on steaks. I could slice them thin, and everyone could choose whether to eat them plain, over a salad, or on a bun.

Pulling out all the meat, I grabbed a cast-iron skillet, seasoned it with oil and salt, and let it heat up. Patting the steaks dry, I seasoned both sides before melting butter in the pan and adding the first one.

I preheated the oven to keep warm and started prepping ingredients for coleslaw—simple enough.

After mixing the slaw in a large bowl and tossing it with dressing, I stashed it in the fridge. Back at the stove, I used tongs to sear the steak on all sides before flipping it, aiming for a perfect medium-rare.

Once done, I wrapped it in foil and placed it in the oven, repeating the process with the rest. As I set the table with various toppings and sides, the kitchen door swung open.

"Something smells amazing."

My stomach dropped as I turned. "Alpha Benjamin..."

###Chapter 0224

"Relax. I'm not here to cause trouble." Alpha Benjamin dismissed my tense reaction with a casual wave.

"Sebastian... dinner's ready and your father just entered the kitchen." I kept my voice steady despite the pounding in my chest.

"On my way." Sebastian's reply carried an undercurrent of unease through our bond.

"The steaks are done. You can take a seat—I'll bring them out in a moment." Turning away, I grabbed oven mitts and pulled the sizzling meat from the grill. But instead of moving to the dining area, he lingered by the doorway, observing as I sliced each portion with precision. Leaving them on the cutting board, I carried the platter to the table.

"Evelyn?" Sebastian's voice rang through the house.

"In here!" Relief flooded me at his arrival.

Sebastian burst through the door and froze at the sight of his father. "What are you doing here?"

"She didn't tell you I was visiting?" Alpha Benjamin arched a brow, skepticism dripping from his tone.

"Why are you lurking in the corner watching her cook?" Sebastian squared his shoulders, facing his father head-on.

"Merely ensuring her safety. No trouble intended."

"After everything she's endured, you thought silent observation would comfort her?"

The temperature seemed to drop as they locked gazes. Oliver and several warriors filed in, their eyes darting between the two alphas before instinctively flanking Sebastian.

"Let's all move to the dining room and eat," I interjected, desperate to diffuse the tension.

"Brilliant suggestion. Need any help?" Oliver offered cheerfully. The standoff between father and son remained unbroken.

"No, everything's set." I seized Sebastian's arm, gently steering him away from the confrontation.

The warriors took their seats, but Sebastian deliberately occupied the alpha's chair, leaving no space for his father. "Alright everyone—steaks are served. Have them plain, in salads, or as sandwiches. Dig in."

Silence blanketed the room as plates were filled. I'd already prepared a steak salad for myself and began eating. Alpha Benjamin assembled a sandwich before retreating to his office without another word. Only then did the collective tension ease with audible exhales.



"This is incredible," Oliver mumbled through a full mouth.

"Swallow before speaking," I chided, shooting him a look.

"Luna..." A young warrior—skinny, likely my age—fidgeted, his eyes darting between me and his plate.

"Yes?"

"Are you... um..."

"Spit it out, man," another warrior groaned.

"Are you okay?"

"Yes. Much better now that my wolf has returned. Thank you for asking." I offered a small smile as comfortable quiet settled over the group. Sebastian seemed lost in thought, emotions flickering across his face—anger, reluctant acceptance, fleeting sorrow.

As plates emptied, Sebastian stood abruptly. "Ready?"

"Yes, Alpha!" The warriors responded in near unison.

"Joining us?" Sebastian asked as the group rose.

"No. I'll clean up and work in our office until you're back." Sighing, I began gathering dishes.

"We'll handle this," a warrior said, gently taking the stack from my hands.

"Too heavy for you," another added. Within moments, they'd cleared the table, even storing leftovers and loading the dishwasher—a task that would've taken me an hour, completed in minutes by their efficient teamwork.

As they filed out, each bowed respectfully. Sebastian lingered, pressing a kiss to my forehead. "Lock the office door behind you."

###Chapter 0225

"Alright." I didn't argue as I turned and hurried toward our office. No point in lingering.

For some reason, this task felt heavier than it should. Working in an office suddenly seemed suffocating. When I locked the door behind me, the sight of scattered paperwork greeted me—piles still on the floor, the phone records still incomplete. Ignoring the mess, I settled into Sebastian’s chair, easily navigating out of the photos and pulling up the next folder.

"How’s it going?" I mind-linked Sebastian. About twenty minutes had passed since the third explosion rocked the packhouse. The first time it happened, I’d genuinely thought it was an earthquake.

"Just wrapping up. What are you up to?"

"Finished going through the files. Nothing unusual stood out." No matter how hard I scrutinized, nothing screamed clue to me. It probably meant something—just not something I could decipher.

"Didn’t think there would be. Pretty sure they dumped this on us just to keep us occupied. Doubt this is even everything from the phone." Sebastian grunted, the sound of something heavy being moved echoing through the link.

"I’d kill to get my hands on his computer." Leaning back, I surveyed the chaotic office.

"Has he left you alone?"

"Yeah. Too quiet, actually. It’s unsettling."

"Hopefully things settle back to normal soon." His words were hollow—we both knew better.

"Yeah, and Sophia’s going to stop crying over every little thing." Standing, I began gathering the papers from the floor, arranging them methodically in case we needed to reconstruct anything.

"Damn." Sebastian snorted. "I’ll see you soon. Stay put—I’ll come get you, and we’ll head up to our room."

"What about dinner?"

"Ordered pizza for everyone." His voice softened. "You’ve done enough today."

"Fine." I wasn’t about to protest. My shoulders ached less, but hauling heavy gear had taken its toll.

Sebastian didn’t reply, but he kept the link open. By the time I finished organizing the photos, the door clicked open.

"Hey." I shoved the air chair aside as he stepped in.

"What are you doing?" Sebastian was drenched in sweat and dust.

"Putting the office back together." Shrugging, I flicked off the lights and slipped past him as he held the door.

"Fucking sweltering down in those tunnels." He exhaled sharply.

"Smells like it." I pinched my nose, wrinkling my face in exaggerated disgust.

"Hilarious." He reached for me, but I ducked away.

"Nope! Shower first!" Laughing, I darted ahead, putting distance between us.

"You can’t run forever, especially not in our room." His voice dropped into that low, teasing tone that sent heat rushing through me.

"Tell you what…" I leaned against our bedroom door as he closed the gap. "You shower first, and then I’ll show you what else my tongue can do besides sassing you." I met his gaze and winked.

"I’m holding you to that." He growled, unlocking the door and striding straight to the bathroom without hesitation. The shower turned on—no steam, so definitely cold.

"When’s the pizza getting here?" I called, peeking into the bathroom.

"Fifteen minutes."

"Is Oliver meeting the delivery at the border?"

"Yeah, with another warrior. They’ll bring it back."

"So… what’s next?" I sighed, frustration creeping in. "I feel like we evacuated everyone for nothing. We can’t waste this opportunity, but I don’t even know where to start."

###Chapter 0226

"The million-dollar question. We're brainstorming ideas over pizza tonight." Sebastian sounded exhausted.

"I don't get why we can't find anything they own. Even under an alias, money has to go somewhere. There's always a trail—a P.O. box, a bank account. Has anyone considered tapping into their phone system?"

"What?" Sebastian turned from the shower, water dripping down his chest.

"Think about it. Most banking is done over phones and apps now. You can deposit checks by scanning them. My father hasn't stepped foot in a bank in years. We can't follow him, but his phone? It holds every number he calls. We could track his bank, his contacts—everything."

"That would mean sneaking into his territory." Sebastian mused, actually considering it.

"Not necessarily. Just hack the service provider and pull his records. Unless you want to listen in live—then yeah, you'd have to get close."

"There are only two major phone companies in this area." Sebastian murmured.

"Exactly."

He turned off the water and grabbed a towel, wrapping it around his waist as he stepped out. "So, we find someone to hack the provider, trace the numbers, and follow the trail."

"In theory, yes. Unlisted numbers complicate things, but if they're with the same provider, you can still track them."

"How do we pinpoint their territory's numbers?"

"They probably have a dozen, just like us. But location matters. If it's a cell, we can ping it. The physical address will be in the system—that's how they route the service." I shrugged, watching him dress. My words had clearly distracted him from earlier tensions.

"Interesting." Sebastian's mind was racing.

"You could go deeper—track internet and data usage. If they're using VoIP or apps, you can trace those too. Every device leaves a footprint."

"That’s…" A knock interrupted him. "...insane to even consider." He walked to the door and opened it.

"Pizza's downstairs." Oliver stood there, hands in his pockets, wearing nothing but gym shorts.

"I'm starving." My stomach growled on cue as I headed toward the door.

"Long day?" Oliver raised an eyebrow at me.

"Just glued to a screen." I shrugged as Sebastian locked the door behind us. "Guess my mouth will have to wait," I teased through the mind-link.

Sebastian shot me a narrowed glare. I just smiled.

"Sounds awful," Oliver deadpanned.

"I’d rather have been blowing things up all day."

"You could’ve been blowing me," Sebastian grumbled privately.

###Chapter 0227

"Move faster, Alpha! The meat lovers pizza is disappearing fast!"

I really needed to memorize the warriors' names. How many times had I spoken to them without knowing who they were? About twenty men sat scattered around the room, ranging from fresh-faced eighteen-year-olds to grizzled veterans in their fifties. Every single one looked like they could bench-press a truck.

"Meat does sound perfect right now," I mind-linked Sebastian. He rolled his eyes as we approached the pizza-laden table. Sebastian handed me a paper plate before taking one himself. Scanning the options, I grabbed one slice of meat lovers and one beef pizza while Sebastian piled three supreme slices onto his plate.

We settled onto the couch where the warriors had left space for us. The moment we sat down, one of the younger warriors leaned forward.

"What's the strategy, Alpha?"

"Before we begin," I interrupted, "I'm embarrassed to admit I don't know all your names yet. Could you introduce yourselves as we talk?"

The warrior who'd spoken looked sheepish. "My apologies, Luna. I'm Theodore." He appeared to be among the youngest present.

"Let the Alpha eat first, Theo," chastised a middle-aged warrior with salt-and-pepper hair. "Name's Donovan," he added with a nod in my direction.

Sebastian shot me an amused look as I took my first bite. "Actually, Evelyn and I were just brainstorming. She came up with an... interesting approach."

"I'd call it more of a sarcastic comment than a plan," I corrected around a mouthful of pizza, earning several chuckles from the warriors.

Another warrior spoke up. "What's the idea?" He quickly added, "Vincent, Luna," before I could ask.

"The problem is..." I swallowed before continuing, "We don't know which properties he owns, and apparently that information is well-hidden. So I suggested we bug his phone."

"Bug his phone?" Theodore looked horrified. "That would require entering his territory! That's suicide!"

"Let her finish," Sebastian growled, silencing the younger warrior.

"Bugging would only give us audio. We need locations. My real suggestion is hacking the phone company to access his account records. Every call he makes leaves a digital trail we can follow."

"Well, damn." This came from a gray-haired warrior to my left who introduced himself as "Maxwell" when our eyes met.

"If he uses data, we might even track physical locations. But we'd need an expert hacker to bypass firewalls and security." I took another bite as the warriors exchanged glances.

"Harrison," several of the younger men said simultaneously.

"Harrison?" Sebastian scanned the group.

"He's just a kid - thirteen, maybe fourteen. Supposedly some kind of tech genius, though he mostly uses his skills for... less than noble purposes," Theodore explained.

"Has he been in trouble for hacking?" Sebastian asked.

"Nothing major enough to reach you, Alpha. Got suspended last semester for stealing test answers," Theodore shrugged.

Another young warrior frowned. "If he's so smart, why'd he need the answers?"

"Because other students paid him. Only got caught when a teacher walked in on him mid-hack."

The oldest-looking warrior, who'd been silent until now, spoke up. "If we get locations, we still have most of those explosives from the tunnel operation. We could move within hours." His gaze locked onto Sebastian as he spoke, awaiting approval.

The room fell into thoughtful silence as everyone processed the plan. I could practically see the gears turning in Sebastian's head as he weighed the risks. My pizza suddenly tasted less appetizing as the gravity of what we were considering settled over me. This wasn't just strategy - people's lives hung in the balance.

###Chapter 0228

"Good." Sebastian nodded. "I'll contact Sophia and Audrey to coordinate with Harrison and begin the hacking operation."

Maxwell studied me with a raised brow. "What's on your mind?"

I exhaled sharply. "When do we pause and assess before rushing into action? I'm no stranger to conflict, but at some point, we have to ask—when is it enough?"

Sebastian frowned. "Explain."

"Acting recklessly leads to errors. We already destroyed the wrong building. Our next move must be deliberate, strategic, and flawless. We know Damian is dangerous. What if he's waiting for us to slip up? All I'm saying is—we can't afford another mistake. Lives are at stake."

The moment the words left my mouth, regret prickled at me. Maybe I should have voiced this to Sebastian privately. Silence settled over the group, the only sound the rustling of pizza boxes. My gut twisted with unease—I couldn't shake the dread of another misstep. It would make us look incompetent.

Feeling exposed, I stood abruptly.

"Where are you going?" Theodore asked, too quickly.

I hesitated. "Uh—"

Vincent cut in sharply. "She's the Luna. She doesn't owe you an explanation, Theodore. Learn when to hold your tongue."

Theodore ducked his head.

Sebastian's gaze locked onto me. "You're leaving? I still need your input on the timeline."

Surprise flickered through me as his lips quirked into a knowing half-smile. It was as if he understood exactly why I'd spoken up—and why I needed space. "Bathroom," I blurted.

Oliver stood. "I'll call Sophia." He followed me out.

The moment the door shut, he stopped me. "You don't actually need the bathroom."

"I do!" I crossed my arms.

"Sebastian disagrees." Oliver smirked.

I sighed. "Fine. No one said anything after I spoke. Maybe I should've talked to him alone."

Oliver's expression softened. "Evelyn, you said what needed to be said. Their lives matter. No one wants a repeat of our last mistake. You earned their respect tonight—they know you see them as more than expendable."

"Did Sebastian send you after me to make it less obvious?"

"Partly. And because I really do need to call Sophia." He pulled out his phone. "Go back in there and own your role as Luna."

After a steadying breath, I returned. The group had resumed discussing the logistics of infiltrating the telecom company. Sebastian glanced at me but kept speaking, deftly shifting attention away—a small mercy.

"...It can be done remotely. We don't need physical access to their infrastructure," Sebastian said.

Theodore frowned. "Is that true, Luna? No sneaking into their facilities?"

"Have you been binge-watching heist movies?" I teased. "No. We can execute this from here."

"Assuming Harrison delivers," Sebastian added.

A thought struck me. Oliver! Did you reach Sophia? I mind-linked him urgently.

###Chapter 0229

"On the phone, why?"

"Harrison needs his own IP address. That way, it can't be traced back to our pack."

"Got it. I'll let her know." Oliver replied before ending the call.

"Evelyn!" Vincent's voice cut through the room.

"What? Oh, sorry—I was making sure Oliver told Sophia that Harrison needed a separate connection for this." I'd completely zoned out of their conversation.

"It's fine. I was asking about the intel we gathered. We should have phone numbers or locations with active signals. How do we decide which one to target?" Vincent posed a logical question—one I didn’t have a full answer to.

"Whichever makes the most strategic sense. If it were up to me, I’d stake them out first and hit where it’ll hurt them the most."

"We should be acting now, not waiting!" A warrior from the back stood abruptly, pacing like a caged animal. I could feel Sebastian’s irritation rising.

"Alright." I kept my tone neutral. "Care to explain?"

His glare locked onto me. "They didn’t wait to destroy your shop! They didn’t hesitate to kidnap you! They took action. Meanwhile, we look weak just sitting here!" His face flushed with frustration.

"Your name?" I asked calmly.

"Julian." He exhaled sharply, shoving his dirty blonde hair out of his eyes. He looked to be in his late twenties, muscles taut with barely contained rage.

"Do you realize they spent nearly a year digging those tunnels? And my shop was a public target—planned for years. Years, Julian. This wasn’t some impulsive move. If that building had been vital, we’d have struck back already. Or would you rather charge in blindly and risk every warrior here?" My voice stayed steady, unwavering.

Sebastian had reclined, arm draped over the couch behind me, watching the exchange with lazy amusement. "I can’t just sit here and do nothing!" Julian growled, frustration lacing his words.

"Acting on emotion won’t get you the result you want. What do you think they’re thinking right now? If I were them, I’d be waiting for us to walk into a trap. Sometimes, patience is the deadliest weapon."

"We relocated our pack expecting an attack," another warrior chimed in.

"Exactly. They’re braced for a fight—and we’ll give them one. Just not today. We strike when they least expect it, where it’ll hurt the most." My words carried weight, silencing the room.

Julian finally sat back down, still seething but no longer arguing.

"What’s the plan for tomorrow?" Theodore asked.

"We’ll see what Harrison digs up tonight. Evelyn and I have to visit Alpha Alexander’s pack tomorrow anyway. Depending on what we find, we’ll adjust accordingly." Sebastian leaned forward, signaling the discussion was over.

"So… we get a day off?" a younger warrior beside Theodore asked hopefully.

"Stay alert, but yes—you can relax." Sebastian’s hand settled on my knee, a silent cue that it was time to retire.

"Get some rest, everyone." I stood, Sebastian following as the room murmured goodnights.

"Why hasn’t Oliver come back yet?" I murmured as we stepped into the hall.

###Chapter 0230

"Not sure." Sebastian placed his hand on the small of my back as we climbed the stairs. "I'll mind-link him."

"Okay."

Thankfully, he responded within minutes. "Still on the phone with Sophia. She confirmed Harrison is working on it, but it'll take some time."

"That's fine." I stifled a yawn as we reached our room.

"Tired?"

"Yes... no." I shrugged. Sebastian held the door open, locking it behind us.

"Worried about tomorrow?" He crossed the room and poured two glasses of whiskey while I sank into the couch.

"My father might die, and Grayson will take the role he was born for." I exhaled sharply. "What’s there not to worry about?"

"Death might be a relief for someone in your father’s position." Sebastian sighed, settling beside me. He handed me my glass, and I took a sip before leaning into his arm draped over my shoulders.

"I’ll miss him."

"I know." His voice softened. "But isn’t his happiness worth everything he’s prepared you for?"

I met his gaze. He downed the rest of his whiskey, his expression unreadable.

"It is. But Grayson will be the only family I have left." My fingers tightened around the glass. "No matter how difficult your parents are… at least they’re still here. Losing both changes everything."

"You still have Sophia and Nathan. They’re like siblings to you. And despite how much you argue with Oliver, he’s practically your brother too."

"When he’s not being insufferable." I snorted.

Sebastian set his glass down and stood, offering me his hand. "Come on. Let’s get some rest."

I drained my drink and let him pull me up. Stripping off my shorts, shirt, and bra, I tugged on one of his discarded shirts before slipping under the covers. He pulled me against his chest, his warmth seeping into me.

"Sleep," he murmured. "You’re safe. You’re loved."

Darkness swallowed me before he finished speaking.

"Almost ready?" Sebastian peeked into the closet.

I’d showered, curled my hair, and applied my makeup, but now I stood frozen in front of my clothes, wearing nothing but a matching lingerie set. Sebastian had already dressed—dark jeans that hugged his hips and a fitted athletic tee that accentuated his broad shoulders.

"I can’t decide what to wear." My pulse raced, my hands trembling. Sweat threatened to ruin my makeup, and my legs refused to stay still.

"Wear a sundress or one of those… shirt-shorts things." He stepped inside, scanning my wardrobe.

"A romper?"

He pulled out a deep violet one with capped sleeves and a cinched waist, the hem stopping mid-thigh. The subtle V-neck made my legs look miles long. Slipping it on, I frowned at the mirror.

"I’ve lost muscle."

"How’s your shoulder?" he asked as I adjusted the fabric. The bruises had faded to faint yellow and green.

"Almost normal."

But the reflection staring back at me felt foreign. Six months ago, if someone had told me I’d be dressing for what might be my last dinner with my father—before he chose to die—I would’ve called them a liar. My hair was longer, my toned arms softer, my skin too pale.

"You look beautiful." Sebastian wrapped his arms around me from behind.

"I look like I need six months of sun and training to look human again." I rolled my eyes, grabbing my purse and stepping away.

He didn’t react to my deflection. He’d been watching me all morning, concern hidden behind his calm exterior.

###Chapter 0231

"I'd still have you in a heartbeat." Sebastian shot me a heated glance before swinging the door open.

"You barely tried last night," I pointed out as I stepped out. The door clicked shut behind me, followed by the sound of the lock engaging.

"You didn’t seem interested." His palm settled possessively on the small of my back as we headed toward the garage.

"I could’ve been convinced."

"Noted." He rolled his eyes, but the corner of his mouth twitched.

"Are your parents joining us?" I asked as he opened the passenger door of a sleek black Audi for me.

"No. After everything that’s happened, I thought it best they stay back." He shut my door and rounded the car, sliding into the driver’s seat. The engine purred to life, and we pulled out of the garage.

"Where was everyone this morning?"

"Probably taking advantage of the rare morning off to sleep in."

My legs bounced restlessly, my fingers tapping against the seat. The nerves were eating at me. Sebastian reached over and clamped a firm hand on my thigh, stilling my movements. Instinctively, my hands flew to his forearm, gripping it like a lifeline. He didn’t even flinch at the pressure.

"I was hoping I’d never have to see these gates again," I murmured as we approached the estate. The guards recognized me immediately, nodding before swinging the gates open.

"Evelyn," Sebastian said quietly, his voice steady. "I know this is hard. But remember—this is his choice. He wants this. As much as it hurts you and Grayson, his soul will finally be free."

His words hit me like a bucket of ice water, shocking me into momentary clarity. I sucked in a deep breath, forcing myself to steady.

Grayson and Audrey stood waiting on the porch steps. His arm was wrapped protectively around her waist, and she waved enthusiastically as we pulled up. I took one last fortifying breath before Sebastian opened my door. I barely registered him stepping out.

"Evelyn! It’s so good to see you!" Audrey rushed down the steps and threw her arms around me. The warmth of her embrace was a small comfort.

"How are you?" She looked well—no dark circles, no bruises.

"I’ve actually had a really good week." She didn’t need to elaborate. I understood.

"Hey, sis." Grayson approached, and I launched myself into his arms. The familiar scent of my twin brother wrapped around me, a grounding force no one else could replicate.

"Hey," I managed, my voice thick.

"How are the shoulders?" He pulled back, scrutinizing them.

"Fine. Just a little bruised." I rotated them to prove my range of motion.

"Good." He stepped back, clasping Sebastian’s hand in a firm shake before pulling him into a brief hug. "Thanks for coming, man."

"Evelyn!" My father’s voice carried from the porch. He strode forward, Margaret trailing behind—though she stopped at the steps, her expression unreadable.

"Dad." I hugged him tightly, trying to memorize the feel of his embrace. The thought that this might be the last time threatened to unravel me.

"You look good, kid. How are you feeling?" He held me at arm’s length, his gaze flicking to my shoulders like Grayson’s had.

"I’m okay. Really." Even if I wasn’t, I wouldn’t tell him.

"Good." He nodded before turning to Sebastian, gripping his hand firmly. "Thank you for bringing her."

Sebastian hesitated, his mouth opening and closing before settling on, "It was my honor, sir."

"Audrey set up a lovely picnic in the garden," Grayson interjected, breaking the tension. I half-expected Margaret to make a snide remark, but she merely lifted her chin and strode ahead, her posture rigid.

Grayson and Audrey led the way, her hand resting soothingly on his back. I exhaled slowly, steeling myself for what was to come.

###Chapter 0232

My fingers curled instinctively around Sebastian's forearm, gripping the firm muscle beneath his sleeve. Not his hand—his arm. The unspoken need to anchor myself to him rather than simply hold hands sent a flicker of unease through me, but I shoved the thought aside. To my relief, Sebastian didn’t question it. He let me cling without protest, his presence steady as stone.

The garden had never felt so far away.

I walked this path daily, sometimes twice, seeking refuge among the roses and ivy. Yet today, each step stretched like an eternity. Sebastian radiated tension, his protective instincts coiled tight, but he kept pushing waves of calm toward me through our bond. Or maybe he was siphoning my panic—I couldn’t tell. My pulse thundered too loudly to think straight.

"You outdid yourself," I managed, forcing a smile as we reached the picnic setup. Audrey had arranged a sprawling round table beneath a striped umbrella, its edges weighted by a linen cloth. Platters of fruit, vibrant salads, sliders, and crusty bread crowded the surface, the scents mingling in the warm air.

Audrey beamed. "I’ve been experimenting with new recipes. You’ll have to tell me what you think."

I watched as Sebastian and Grayson maneuvered us into seats, flanking Audrey and me while Nathan and Margaret took the opposite side. Grayson left a conspicuous gap between himself and Margaret—enough for another person—while Nathan kept his distance too.

"Where’d you find these recipes?" Margaret wrinkled her nose, leaning over to sniff a slider.

Audrey’s smile faltered. "A new cookbook I picked up."

My spine stiffened.

Mom’s cookbook.

Were these her sliders? The ones she used to make for us?

"Scarlett?" Grayson’s voice snapped me back. He arched a brow when I didn’t respond. My throat had gone desert-dry.

"Smells incredible," Sebastian interjected smoothly, his palm settling at the small of my back. A lifeline.

"Let’s eat!" Nathan declared, piling sliders onto his plate. Margaret took one but nudged it aside with her fork.

I loaded my plate with bread, salad, and pasta, hesitating when the slider tray reached me. After a breath, I took one and passed it on. Grayson grabbed three without hesitation—like he already knew they’d taste like home.

"So, Sebastian," Nathan said between bites. "Did you seal off those tunnels?"

Grateful for the distraction, I bit into the slider.

The flavors exploded—juicy meatball, melted Swiss cheese, tangy BBQ sauce with a hint of something smoky. The bun was pillowy, dusted with cracked pepper. Perfect. A lump rose in my throat. How many other recipes had Mom left behind? How many memories would I never get to share?

I kept my expression neutral, though I caught Sebastian glancing at me more than once.

"Sealed and reinforced," he answered. "Lost a few trees, but the wall’s intact. There’s a new ravine now. I’ll fill it in once we haul in fresh dirt."

"I’ve got extra from the pool expansion," Nathan offered. "Audrey’s redesign required deeper excavation."

"Sophia wants to build one too," I added, smiling at Audrey.

"I heard! She told me last night. She’s radiant."

Margaret scoffed. "Looked queasy to me."

Nathan shot her a glare sharp enough to make her roll her eyes and turn away. Whatever silent warning he’d issued, it worked.

The slider was halfway to my mouth when Margaret’s next words froze me:

"Honestly, who uses Swiss cheese in a slider? It’s disgusting."

Audrey flinched.

And just like that, the ghost of my mother’s hands—kneading dough, sprinkling cheese, laughing as she flicked flour at me—shattered into silence.

###Chapter 0233

"What's our next move?" Dad asked, deliberately ignoring Margaret.

Sebastian grinned, twirling his fork in the pasta. "Evelyn had a brilliant idea."

I froze mid-bite, my salad fork hovering in the air. Every pair of eyes at the table locked onto me, waiting.

Setting my fork down, I shifted uncomfortably under their scrutiny. "Oh, um… didn’t Audrey already explain?"

"She did," Dad said, his piercing gaze making my skin prickle. "But I want to hear it from you."

That look—I knew it too well. It was the same one he’d given me my entire life, like I was some puzzle he needed to solve.

I exhaled. "If we hack into the telecom company, we can trace his service location and access his call logs. Then we cross-reference the numbers with their registered addresses. After that, we dig deeper. The rest is self-explanatory."

Audrey tilted her head. "How did you even think of that?"

"It started as a sarcastic comment," I admitted. "Sebastian took it seriously, and it just… spiraled from there."

Grayson nodded, chewing on a slider. "That’s actually genius."

"Thanks. I hope it works. Any updates from Harrison?"

Audrey sighed. "He’s making progress, but it’s slow. The firewalls are intense, and he’s being careful not to leave a trace."

Sebastian frowned. "Where’s he working from?"

"Remember that abandoned café a few miles outside the city?" Grayson asked.

Recognition flashed in my mind—broken windows, peeling paint, and the faint rustle of rodents. I glanced at Margaret. She hadn’t touched her food, just pushing it around her plate.

The meal ended, plates cleared. Dad stretched, gazing at the rising sun. "What a perfect morning."

"It really is," Audrey agreed softly.

We all knew what was coming. My fingers curled into fists, nails biting into my palms.

Margaret’s voice cut through the tension. "You promised me a gift."

Dad smiled. "You’re right. I did."

"Well?" She crossed her arms. "The kids are here. Not that they appreciate anything I’ve done, but you insisted. So—where is it?"

Dad stood, his grin widening. "We have to go to it. Let’s take a walk."

Grayson and Audrey exchanged a knowing glance. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to be in on the secret or not. Either way, I wasn’t ready.

We trailed behind Dad and Margaret, Grayson and Audrey flanking us in silence. Dad’s steps were lighter than I’d seen in years. Margaret practically bounced beside him, her excitement palpable.

Then we reached the hill.

A delicate arch stood ahead, draped in cascading white flowers. Pots lined the path, creating an aisle.

Margaret gasped. "You did this? For me? Are we renewing our vows?" She clutched Dad’s arm, eyes shimmering.

Nathan and Wesley stood on either side of the arch, waiting. Had they known?

"Something like that," Dad murmured, leading her forward.

Grayson gestured for us to sit on the left while they took the right. Dad guided Margaret to the center, taking her hands in his. Her smile was blinding, a single tear slipping free.

"This is beautiful," she whispered.

Dad shook his head. "Let me speak."

She stiffened but nodded.

"I prepared something," he said, voice steady.

Margaret straightened, meeting his gaze.

"Margaret," he began, "you came into my life when I needed someone. I had lost my true mate—my one love."

My fingers dug into Sebastian’s arm. He didn’t flinch.

"I had my children. I had this pack. I needed to keep living, and you gave me that chance." Margaret blinked rapidly, as if processing his words. "I thought you’d be a mother to them. That you’d love them, teach them, make memories with them."

The air thickened.

Dad’s grip on her hands tightened. "But you didn’t."

###Chapter 0234

Alexander hesitated, letting his words hang heavily in the air. Margaret tried to wrench her hands free, but his grip only tightened.

"Sebastian... I don't—"

"I was wrong about everything," he said, his voice steady but cold. "You never loved them. All you ever taught them was fear and rage. Every chance you got, you tormented my daughter simply because she reminded you of her mother. But I was smart—I stayed alive long enough to ensure they grew up safe, found their mates, and built their futures. I made sure they wouldn’t need you. And now that they’re grown, with mates who will protect them... I can finally do what I should have done eighteen years ago."

"No!" Margaret thrashed, tears streaming down her face. "Please, don’t! I love you! I rejected my mate for you!"

Alexander frowned. "You what?"

"That’s right!" she spat, her voice breaking. "I rejected my true mate before I came to you! I chose you!"

"Who was it?"

"I’ll never tell!" she hissed.

Alexander’s jaw clenched. Then, with unshakable resolve, he spoke. "I, Alexander Andrews, Alpha of the Crimson Fang Pack, reject you, Margaret Andrews, Luna of the Crimson Fang Pack."

A piercing scream tore from Margaret’s throat as she collapsed, clutching her chest. The bond shattered, the pain of rejection searing through her.

Alexander closed his eyes, enduring his own agony before opening them again. His lips curled into a bitter smile. "You’ll get nothing."

"You can’t do this!" she snarled through gritted teeth.

"I already have. Everything goes to my children."

"I accept your rejection, you coward!" she shrieked.

Grayson stepped forward, steadying his father as Alexander turned to him. "I, Alexander Andrews, Alpha of the Crimson Fang Pack, pass the title of Alpha to my son, Grayson Andrews."

Grayson’s voice was strong. "I, Grayson Andrews, accept the role of Alpha of the Crimson Fang Pack!"

"No!" Margaret wailed, watching in horror as the power shifted.

Alexander staggered, the weight of the transfer weakening him. "Lock her up," Grayson ordered, and two warriors seized Margaret, dragging her away as she kicked and screamed.

"Evelyn," Alexander called weakly.

I didn’t realize I was moving until I was kneeling beside him, tears blurring my vision. His hand trembled as he reached into his pocket, pulling out a delicate string of pearls.

"These were your mother’s," he rasped. "I wanted to give them to you at your Luna ceremony... but I won’t make it." His fingers shook as he tried to hand them to me. I grabbed his hand, clutching the pearls tightly.

"Dad..." My voice cracked.

Grayson knelt on his other side, his eyes wet. "I love you, old man."

Alexander smiled faintly, looking between us before his gaze settled on Sebastian. "Take care of my daughter. There’s no one else I’d trust."

Sebastian nodded firmly. "It will be my honor."

"Evelyn..." Alexander’s breath grew shallow. "I’m happy."

Then his body stiffened, his eyes rolling back.

"Dad!" I screamed, clutching his hand as his wolf faded from his gaze.

For the first time in years, I let myself sob—uncontrolled, unrestrained. He had wanted this freedom, but that didn’t make it hurt any less.

He was gone.

And Margaret hadn’t even lasted five minutes as his rejected mate.

###Chapter 0235

Grayson reached out and gripped my shoulder with trembling fingers. The weight of his touch anchored me as silent tears streamed down both our faces. Time blurred—minutes or hours, I couldn't tell—until Sebastian gently pulled me against his chest.

Nearby, warriors approached with a cedar stretcher. Their movements were reverent as they lifted Father onto it. My gaze drifted past them, finally noticing the pyre assembled a hundred yards away, its stacked logs waiting.

The procession began. As the warriors carried Father toward the flames, our pack—past and present—ascended the hill in solemn silence. Grayson's voice cracked beside me. "He knew his time was short. Planned every detail of this himself."

Sebastian's arm tightened around my waist as we took our seats in the front row. Audrey pressed a linen handkerchief into my palm before settling beside Grayson. Not a single whisper disturbed the air. Only the occasional sniffle broke the stillness.

When the crowd quieted, Grayson stepped forward. Nathan stood vigil near the pyre, his tear-streaked face catching the firelight as our eyes met.

"We gather to honor my father, Alpha Alexander." A muffled sob echoed from the back. Grayson swallowed hard. "Let me share a truth he bore for years. After our mother died, he took Margaret as mate—not for love, but to protect our pack's future." His knuckles whitened around the torch. "He endured her cruelty so we'd never inherit a broken pack. And when the time came..." A shuddering breath. "He chose this. Smiling."

A wet chuckle rippled through the crowd. I leaned into Sebastian as he traced circles on my wrist. Stubborn to the end—of course Father would orchestrate his own finale.

"The moment the Alpha title passed to me," Grayson continued, "Margaret's rejection bond severed his life. But his legacy remains." He turned to Audrey with undisguured devotion. "With Nathan as my Beta, I pledge to lead as he taught me—with strength and heart."

The roar of approval startled me. Nathan ignited a second torch, passing it to Grayson with a nod. Flames reflected in my brother's eyes as he raised it toward the pyre.

###Chapter 0236

"I will always love you, old man. I hope to make you proud and fulfill everything you dreamed for me... for us." Grayson glanced at me, silently asking if I wanted to speak. I shook my head slightly, and he nodded before resting the torch on Dad’s chest. The flames erupted instantly, consuming him.

Nathan brought over a towering oak tree. After placing it in the freshly dug hole, he shoveled dirt over the roots, completing the burial. "We won’t be moving his ashes. Instead, we’ll let them become one with the earth where he fell. That was Dad’s final wish." Grayson moved to sit beside Audrey, while Nathan took a seat in the second row next to Cassandra and his parents.

Silence settled over us as we watched the ashes drift on the wind before sinking into the soil. A distant rumble of thunder announced an approaching storm. It felt fitting—letting his body merge with the earth, returning to where we all began.

One by one, people rose and retreated to their homes or safe havens. Grayson and I remained, watching until the last embers of the fire died out. Nathan stood and began digging another hole for the bones that hadn’t fully burned. Only when the last remnants were buried did Grayson finally rise.

"Come on, sis." His voice was soft but firm. I tore my gaze from the freshly turned earth and looked at him. "There are a few things for you in my office." Numbness clung to me. Knowing Dad had wanted this didn’t dull the pain.

Part of me longed for Sebastian to just carry me away, but pride kept me rooted in place. Instead, I took his hand and let him pull me to my feet. My steps were slow, lagging behind Grayson’s as we descended the hill toward the packhouse in silence. Sebastian didn’t rush me or try to take control. He simply stayed by my side, steady as stone.

As we climbed the steps, my heart hammered in my chest. More than once, I had to remind myself that Margaret wasn’t here anymore. I was safe now—safe to return, to visit my brother, to reconnect with my old pack, my friends, and the families they might build.

Grayson had left the office door open, having arrived minutes ahead of us with Audrey. He was typing something on the computer when we entered. Audrey occupied one of the armchairs, so I took the other. Sebastian remained standing behind me as we waited for my brother to speak.

Grayson exhaled heavily, dragging his fingers through his hair before meeting my gaze. "Dad left you this letter. He wrote it this morning." He slid a vanilla envelope across the desk—thicker than just paper.

"What else is inside?" I asked, accepting it.

"The key. And a few other things." The string of pearls still coiled around my fingers caught the light.

Grayson’s eyes locked onto them. "Mom wore those at her Luna ceremony. It took Dad months to track them down. He refused to put them in the envelope. Wanted to give them to you himself."

"Can I see her house?" My voice was quiet but steady.

"Of course," Audrey answered gently. "Actually, I have some things I’d like to offer you. Since I’ve been staying there—keeping it safe from Margaret—I’ve gone through the house and cleaned it. I’m guessing you already figured out from the food that the cookbook was in your mother’s home. I made copies for you, but if you want the original... I’d understand."

It took me a moment to process her words. A flicker of irritation sparked—everything in that house was rightfully mine, but Dad had left it all to Grayson in his will, contents included. Audrey probably thought she was being kind, offering me these things. But it also meant she’d already taken what she wanted before I even had a chance to see it.

###Chapter 0237

"Scarlett, we should go through the house together and decide what you'd like to keep." Grayson's voice was gentle yet firm. "Audrey only set aside personal items like your baby blanket - things Mom specifically chose for you that you might want for your own children someday." He must have noticed the flicker of emotion crossing my face.

I drew a slow breath, willing my composure to hold. "Alright."

"Like my father before me, I'll be working directly with you on this," Grayson said, turning his attention to Sebastian.

"Understood. I'm handling my end of things. My pack's safety remains my top priority." Sebastian's words carried a subtle weight, and I saw Grayson's sharp glance at me as he caught the underlying meaning.

"Let me know if you need anything," Grayson said as he rose from his chair.

Following his lead, I took one last look around Dad's office. Though Grayson would likely redecorate, this was my final moment seeing it as it had been. Sebastian's warm hand settled on the small of my back, an uncertain but comforting presence. He took the vanilla envelope from me and stood close.

"Would you like anything before we head to the house?" Audrey asked softly, her fingers twisting nervously.

"No... thank you," I managed, grasping the door handle and closing it with deliberate quietness. Sebastian didn't immediately reach for me as we walked, so I caught his arm instead, anchoring myself as we descended the stairs. Pack members moved about their daily routines as if nothing had changed - logically I knew this was normal, but the mundanity stung.

"We'll need to drive. You can follow us," Grayson told Sebastian. His gaze dropped to where I clung to Sebastian's arm like a lifeline, his frown fleeting but unmistakable before he turned away.

"Of course." Sebastian guided me to our car with a gentle hand, opening my door before circling to the driver's seat. He placed the envelope on the dashboard without comment, starting the engine without pressing me to speak. His warm palm settled on my thigh as I watched the packhouse shrink in the rearview mirror.

We wound through the expanding town until reaching the outskirts. Childhood memories surfaced of this area's wild overgrowth, now cleared away. Grayson turned onto a nearly hidden driveway, Sebastian following at a crawl as lush, untouched trees enveloped us before suddenly parting to reveal a weathered two-story house.

Though the paint peeled, the structure stood strong. Sebastian stopped a short distance back, allowing me to take in the full view. Time had left its mark, but the essence remained.

A white screen door guarded the wooden entrance. Brushes and tools leaned against the side of the house as I stepped out, drawn toward it like a magnet.

Freshly trimmed bushes and newly planted flowers bordered the walkway - Audrey's daytime escape, no doubt. My breath caught at the sight of a sturdy tree with a small swing dangling from one branch, its wood darkened by years of rain and neglect. Knowing Mom had hung it there for Grayson and me sent warmth through my chest.

Grayson and Audrey remained silent as I wandered, letting me absorb everything. Trash bags bulged with scraped paint and cobwebbed rags, the sharp scent of bleach cutting through the air. Moldy cushions piled beside them, their replacements on the porch nearly identical to Mom's original fabric choice - Audrey's thoughtful touch didn't escape me.

###Chapter 0238

If my heart could still break, it would have shattered right then. But I was numb, moving through the motions like a ghost.

Grayson held the front door open as I climbed the steps. Audrey had already disappeared inside, standing in the center of the living room when I entered.

To my left, a closet. The wall stretched forward, a flat-screen TV mounted on it. The living room sprawled to my right—spacious, with two dark gray couches facing each other and two sleek black recliners positioned before the TV.

A glass coffee table separated the couches. A faded gray rug lay between them, stopping just short of the recliners. The hardwood floors, original with their narrow slats, bore the marks of time—worn but well-loved.

It felt like home. The kind of place where you could kick off your shoes and sprawl on the couch without a second thought.

Photos lined the walls. I recognized our maternal grandparents from pictures Dad had shown us. Since Mom was an only child, the old baby photos had to be hers.

The mantel displayed gold-framed snapshots of her life—one at nine months, another at five or six, then her high school prom, and finally, a radiant shot of her and Dad, her belly swollen with pregnancy. They looked so in love it hurt.

"I kept everything exactly as it was," Audrey said, pulling me from my thoughts. "I wanted you to see it before we changed anything."

Grayson stepped beside me, lifting the photo I’d been staring at. "If there’s anything you want to take, just say the word. I’m not throwing anything away, but I can store it safely for you."

His words barely registered. "You’re right," I murmured, my gaze drifting over the room. "This is exactly how I would’ve imagined it."

Details jumped out at me—the white ceiling fan with delicate gold pinstripes, the sheer white curtains draped over wooden blinds, the faded white walls begging for a fresh coat of paint.

Audrey reappeared from the kitchen. "This way’s the kitchen, and there’s a small bathroom down the hall."

The kitchen doorway was wider than standard but still just a doorway. The space was L-shaped, with oak cabinets lining the left wall and a large island in the center, three stools tucked beneath it. A small table hugged the right wall.

The scent of wood polish lingered in the air. The golden cabinet handles gleamed. Even the floral wallpaper, though faded, had been scrubbed clean.

More photos hung in the kitchen—Mom and Dad, our grandparents, and one large group shot I didn’t recognize.

"That’s Mom’s family," Grayson said, appearing beside me. "Dad told me who everyone was. I don’t remember all of them—just her parents and siblings."

His voice was soft, almost reverent.

I swallowed hard, my throat tight.

This wasn’t just a house.

It was a time capsule.

And I wasn’t sure I was ready to open it.

###Chapter 0239

"There must be at least a dozen..."

"Exactly. Grandma had eleven siblings. The women eventually left with their mates. Audrey has been trying to track them down to see if we have any other relatives out there."

"Did father not know?" I turned to Grayson.

"He wasn't certain. It wasn't his priority back then, and when things started falling apart, he had to seal this place up for protection."

I could only nod silently. Things must have been truly terrible for him to feel the need to preserve this sanctuary. The front door creaked open and Nathan walked in. The moment our eyes met, I sprinted across the room and threw my arms around him. He squeezed me back tightly, his strong arms enveloping me. It had been ages since I'd seen him, and suddenly I realized how much I'd missed our friendship. I missed our group outings, the pizza nights at Antonio's, the dancing at Moonhowl.

"Hey there, Scarlett." Nathan chuckled as he released me.

"It's been too long." I attempted a smile.

"I know. You've been... preoccupied." Nathan reached behind him and pulled Cassandra close.

"Cassandra. It's wonderful to see you." I immediately regretted hugging Nathan. I knew she'd struggled with accepting him, and seeing him embrace another woman couldn't be easy - especially one she'd only met twice before.

"I'm doing well. I've really come to love it here, and Nathan and I have made tremendous progress in such a short time." Cassandra gazed up at Nathan before adding, "My condolences for your loss," her eyes returning to meet mine.

After an awkward silence, Audrey spoke up. "Would you like to continue the tour?"

Sebastian remained in the corner, hands in his pockets, allowing me to process everything at my own pace. Nathan approached Sebastian for a handshake as I followed Audrey down the hallway.

"This is the bathroom." Audrey flicked on the light. Tucked behind the kitchen wall, it featured basic fixtures with the same wooden flooring. The vanity was painted sky blue with a white marble countertop and matching sink. Even the toilet and clawfoot tub matched the aquatic theme, complete with seashell-printed shower curtain and seahorse decorations.

"Here's the master suite with en-suite bathroom, and these are the stairs." Audrey gestured to a door adjacent to the bathroom. When she opened it, I gasped at the expansive bedroom. A four-poster bed dominated the space, draped with white lace canopy. The plush white duvet was piled high with at least a dozen pillows. A hand-stitched quilt lay at the foot of the bed.

I picked up the quilt and inhaled deeply, but it carried no scent. "Do you want to keep that?" Grayson asked.

Running my fingers over the embroidered letters, I shook my head. "No, it belongs here. I'm not an Andrews anymore." As I set it down, I noticed French doors slightly ajar, revealing what appeared to be a walk-in closet, with the bathroom likely extending beneath the staircase.

Grayson opened the stairway door, with only Audrey and Sebastian following me. I noticed Nathan and Cassandra had settled on the couch, giving us privacy. The L-shaped staircase opened into a sunlit playroom. A plush sofa and rocking chairs surrounded by pink and blue baby toys created a cheerful space. Matching playmats lined the walls alongside teething rings and rattles - one set blue, one pink. Floor-to-ceiling windows offered views of the backyard and forest beyond.

The original hardwood floors remained but were softened by a vibrant educational rug featuring rainbows, numbers, and toddler activities. Clearly our mother had been preparing this as our playroom, her enthusiasm leading her to purchase items we wouldn't need for years. It felt like glimpsing into the life we might have had.

"There are bedrooms down here," Grayson said, leading us into a hallway. The first bedroom welcomed us with soft pink walls and a dark-stained wooden crib against the far wall. A changing table and dresser stood sentry on either side, their surfaces decorated with floral decals. The crib bedding continued the pink and purple flower theme, with a matching quilt draped over the rail. Like the rest of the house, a large area rug anchored the space, continuing the floral motif our mother had apparently chosen just for me.

###Chapter 0240

The cardboard boxes sat neatly stacked against the pastel pink wall. "These contain all the clothes and blankets she chose for you," Audrey murmured, her fingers tracing the edge of the crib. "Take whatever you want. The bedding and furniture are yours now. Everything in this room belongs to you."

A hollow numbness spread through my chest. Children weren't something I'd considered yet, and the sudden weight of this decision left me speechless.

Sebastian's warm hand settled on the small of my back. "Let's take everything," he suggested smoothly. "We'll store it until we're ready. Then you can decide what to keep." His calm voice anchored me when my thoughts were scattering like leaves in a storm.

"Okay." The word came out barely above a whisper. I was grateful he'd spoken for me when my own voice failed.

"My room had the same furniture, just in blues and grays," Grayson commented as he led us across the hall. Where my nursery had floral decals, his walls bore the silhouette of a howling wolf above a rustic toy chest. The masculine color scheme contrasted sharply with my pink sanctuary, yet the identical furniture created an invisible thread connecting our childhoods.

Audrey gestured down the hallway. "Guest bathroom there, and my temporary room at the end."

The growl of Grayson's stomach startled me - I hadn't realized how late it had gotten. Audrey smirked as he pulled her close. "So you're really going to Florida to check out that key?" he asked.

Sebastian nodded. "Once we tie up loose ends here."

"Make it sooner rather than later." Grayson moved toward the staircase, and I followed after pausing for one last look at the pastel prison of what might have been.

"Need help with these?" Sebastian hefted one of the boxes.

"Please." As he and Grayson carried the boxes downstairs, I noticed the dresser top stood bare - Audrey must have packed everything. Clutching the baby blanket to my chest like a talisman, I trailed after them.

"Nathan, grab the last box," Grayson ordered as they stepped onto the porch.

Audrey turned to me. "Would you like to stay for dinner?"

My stomach twisted. Part of me wanted to bolt, while another part longed to soak up every second in this house full of ghosts. "Thank you, but... I think I just want to go home. Maybe watch a movie."

Understanding softened Audrey's features. "This door is always open to you. No invitation needed." She glanced around the nursery. "Your mother wanted to raise you here, so Grayson and I will raise our children here too. To give them the childhood she dreamed of for you."

"Thank you." The words tasted like ashes. Maybe Sebastian would build us a house on pack lands - not the packhouse with its impersonal corridors, but a real home that carried this same warmth.

The men returned, Sebastian studying my face with that uncanny ability to read my moods. "Harrison's still working on it," Grayson announced from the doorway. "You're welcome to stay as long as you want, or I can call when he's done."

"Just call me." My gaze swept the living room, memorizing details - the worn spot on the armchair, the way afternoon light painted gold rectangles on the hardwood.

Grayson stepped closer. "Sure you won't stay for dinner?"

"I'm sure. Takeout and a bad movie sound perfect right now." When he pulled me into a hug, I caught the faint scent of his cologne mixed with packhouse detergent.

"Love you, little sister," he whispered into my hair.

"Love you too." I felt his lips curve against my temple before he schooled his features.

Outside, Sebastian opened the car door for me. I hesitated, turning back toward the house that held so many might-have-beens. I knew I'd return, though it would never look quite the same again. Settling into the passenger seat, I watched through the window as Sebastian slid behind the wheel and started the engine, carrying us away from the ghosts and toward whatever future awaited us.

###Chapter 0241

"Ready?" Sebastian's voice was low, giving me one final opportunity to back out.

"I've never been more ready." I wrapped my fingers around his forearm, curling my knees to my chest. His palm pressed against my thigh as I rested my head against his shoulder. The engine roared to life as we began our journey home.

"What are you craving for dinner?"

"Something that'll set my mouth on fire."

"Thai?" Sebastian suggested after a brief pause.

"Perfect." The scenery blurred past us as we crossed into pack territory. The silence between us was comfortable, the radio deliberately left off to preserve the peaceful moment.

Sebastian suddenly slammed the brakes as we approached the border. My stomach dropped. The guard post stood abandoned, its gate shattered on the ground. Every instinct in my body screamed danger.

Something was terribly wrong. Sebastian's entire posture transformed as he accelerated. I could feel Luna stirring restlessly in my mind as we arrived at the horrific scene before us. Three armed men motioned for us to stop and exit the vehicle.

Our warriors knelt in submission, hands laced behind their heads, bound together with thick ropes. Luna Amelia mirrored their position while Alpha Benjamin's face was a mask of blood. He knelt before Alpha Damian.

Dominic's grin made my skin crawl as I stepped out. "There you are! Missed all the excitement?" He grabbed my arm violently, yanking me forward. The chilling click of a gun's safety being released froze my blood. From my peripheral vision, I saw a pistol pressed against Sebastian's temple.

"Make one wrong move and she's dead," a warrior from Alpha Damian's pack taunted.

"What do you want?" I demanded, my voice steady despite the chaos.

"We came for war, but found an empty nest," Alpha Damian replied, scanning our compromised territory with visible disappointment.

"It's me you're after." I avoided Sebastian's burning gaze as they forced him to his knees beside his bound warriors.

"Exactly right." Dominic seized my face, crushing his lips against mine. Still in control of my body, I finally acted on my long-held desire. My knee connected sharply with his groin. "GODDAMMIT!" He crumpled in agony. A warrior's palm cracked across my face, splitting my lip.

The gunshot was deafening. Warm blood sprayed across my cheeks as a body collapsed against me. The warrior who struck me now lay dead at my feet, his lifeblood staining my skin.

"How many times must I remind you idiots?" Alpha Damian's fury was volcanic. "She's not to be touched!" He kicked Dominic's prone form. "Get up, you pathetic fool."

"Take me and spare them." My attention snapped to Sebastian as they sprayed something in his face. Despite his resistance, the wolfsbane took effect. The fire in his eyes remained, but the telltale blackness of his wolf had vanished. Scanning the scene, I realized all our warriors had suffered the same fate.

"My dear," Alpha Damian purred, "it seems Alpha Benjamin forgot how to fight back." He leveled his gun at Theodore.

"NO!" I threw myself in the weapon's path. "I'm your prize! What kind of Alpha murders defenseless men after stealing their wolves? Only a coward." My defiance earned me a flash of Luna's presence in my eyes.

"You know what? You're absolutely right." Alpha Damian's smile turned predatory as he redirected his aim toward Alpha Benjamin. "I do prefer my battles... challenging."

###Chapter 0242

The gunshot exploded before I could blink.

The bullet tore through Sebastian's abdomen, sending him crashing to his knees, gasping like a fish out of water.

"Load up! She's coming with us!" Damian's grip was iron as he yanked me toward the waiting vehicles.

I managed one last desperate look at Sebastian before being thrown into the trunk. The door slammed shut, plunging me into darkness as the engine roared to life. Tires screeched as we sped away.

Within minutes, I felt it - the seismic shift of power.

Alpha Benjamin was dead.

Sebastian was now Alpha.

Which made me... Luna.

My wolf surged forward, claws scraping beneath my skin, demanding blood. But with our warriors still wolfless, I had to bide my time.

Sebastian's POV

"EVELYN!"

It took precious seconds to rip through the ropes without my wolf's strength. By the time I staggered to my feet, the tail lights were disappearing through the gates.

"Sebastian." My father spat blood onto the grass.

Rage turned my vision red. She'd let them take her - but what choice did we have? If Evelyn had fought, we'd all be corpses now. She'd saved us.

"WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?" My roar shook the trees as I turned on my father. Blood streaked down his ashen face.

"BENJAMIN!" Mother screamed, cradling him as his gaze locked onto mine.

"Forgive me... son." His eyes rolled back.

The pain was a knife twisting in my chest as his life faded - but the Alpha power transferred instantly. The full weight hadn't settled yet, but I could feel it coursing through my veins.

"Move them. Then we ride." I barked orders as warriors finally broke free. Two lifted my father's body while others carried Theodore to the morgue.

Twice.

Twice now they'd taken her from me.

"Alpha..." A warrior approached.

My fist connected with his jaw before he could finish.

"WHERE WAS YOUR FUCKING WATCH? NOT A SINGLE SCRATCH ON ANY OF YOU!" I stormed toward my truck. "MOVE YOUR ASSES BEFORE I START KILLING PEOPLE MYSELF!"

I didn't wait for the others. The engine screamed as I floored it, tires barely touching dirt as we launched over hills.

Then - gunfire.

Warm blood sprayed across my face as a body collapsed against me. The warrior who'd just spoken was now a corpse painting me crimson.

"How many times must I teach you mongrels?" Alpha Damian's voice dripped venom. He kicked Dominic's leg. "Get up. You're pathetic."

"Take me and leave them alone!" Evelyn's voice cut through the chaos.

I saw the wolfsbane spray hit my face before I could hold my breath. The burn seared my lungs. My wolf vanished, leaving me hollow.

Glancing around, I realized they'd done the same to every warrior.

"Sweetheart," Damian purred, aiming his gun at Theodore. "Unlike Alpha Benjamin, I don't hesitate."

"NO!" Evelyn threw herself in front of the barrel. "You want me? Then take me! What kind of Alpha murders defenseless men after stealing their wolves? A coward's move."

Damian's smile turned feral. "You're right. Where's the sport in this?"

The gun swung toward my father's body.

The last thing I saw was Evelyn's eyes flashing wolf-gold before darkness swallowed me whole.

###Chapter 0243

"Nightshade, Alpha." The warrior beside him spoke.

"He bound us and dragged Alpha Benjamin before him. He demanded to know why our pack was deserted and where everyone had gone. He kept asking for Luna Evelyn's whereabouts. Alpha Benjamin and the others refused to speak. Then Alpha Sebastian and Luna Evelyn arrived. They sprayed Alpha Sebastian immediately, forcing him to his knees. Luna Evelyn threw herself in front of the gun, offering herself in exchange for our lives. She even called Alpha Damian a coward for targeting defenseless wolves. Alpha Dominic tried to assault her, but she kneed him where it hurt most. A warrior struck her—Alpha Damian killed his own man for laying hands on her. He also executed one of our warriors. In the end, he took Luna Evelyn and shot Alpha Benjamin. Alpha Benjamin is dead."

I hadn’t noticed the growing crowd. Gasps and cries erupted around us. "Alpha Damian has my sister," Grayson said, his voice eerily calm. Audrey sprinted back inside.

"Where the hell is Oliver?" I demanded, realizing his absence.

"Alpha Damian locked Beta Oliver in another trunk. He has both Beta Oliver and Luna Evelyn." My rage boiled over. I knocked out three men before two others restrained me, pulling me away from my warriors.

"HERE!" Audrey came running out with a black bag. She stopped right in front of me, unfazed by the men holding me back. She grabbed a bottle from the bag, tipping it to my lips and forcing me to drink. The liquid touched my tongue and vanished.

Agony tore through my spine as I collapsed to the ground. One knee planted, one hand braced, I felt my wolf surge forward. He was furious—nothing would stand in his way. My vision darkened, my eyes turning black.

"Warriors, prepare for battle," Grayson commanded. His expression was unreadable, but his brow lifted slightly at the sight of my eyes. He turned to leave, but another car screeched to a halt.

I was on my feet, ready to fight, when Sophia stepped out of the driver’s seat. A young boy followed from the passenger side. "Grayson!" She rushed forward, her swollen belly more pronounced now.

"What is it, Sophia?" Grayson’s control was impressive.

She froze, taking in the scene before her. Her words caught in her throat as her gaze landed on me. Tears welled in her eyes—she must have realized my father was dead, and I was now her Alpha.

"Alpha Grayson! I breached the firewalls! I’m in!" The kid had to be Harrison.



"My men are coming through. Don’t stop them," I growled before speeding off. Grayson bolted from the packhouse with Nathan close behind. Thankfully, my warriors drove fast, pulling up right behind me.

"What’s happening? Where’s Evelyn?" Grayson demanded.

I didn’t answer. Instead, I stormed over to one of my warriors climbing out of his car. I seized him by the throat, dragging him before Grayson and throwing him to the ground.

"Tell him what the hell happened!" I roared. The warrior bowed his head, shame and fear written across his face. The others knelt as he began speaking.

"We were relaxing on the porch. Alpha Sebastian and Luna Evelyn had spent the morning here, so we had nothing to do—" His excuse only fueled my fury. I punched him in the temple, knocking him unconscious.

"You’re next. No excuses," I warned the next warrior, my voice deadly calm.

"Alpha Damian attacked with guns blazing. Before we could react, he was standing over us. He sprayed something in our faces—it took our wolves away," he rushed out.

###Chapter 0244

The lab was filled with an eerie glow from the neon lights overhead. Multiple beakers bubbled with liquids of varying colors—some deep crimson, others an unsettling emerald green. A few technicians were carefully heating them over Bunsen burners, the blue flames flickering beneath the glass.

"What is all this?" I whispered, torn between horror and fascination.

"Experimental formulas," Alpha Damian answered, his voice low and deliberate. He gestured toward one of the beakers. "This one is wolfsbane concentrate—fast-acting, suppresses the wolf within seconds. And these?" He pointed to a row of vials filled with murky substances. "Poisons. Some lethal, some... slower."

Then, with a gloved hand, he picked up a small, obsidian sphere. It looked like a bath bomb, but the way he held it told me it was anything but harmless. "Drop this into a water supply," he murmured, "and within hours, an entire city would be dead before they even realized they'd been poisoned."

My stomach twisted. "What's in it?"

"A closely guarded secret," he replied, his gaze sharpening in warning. I knew better than to press further.

Dominic pulled me away, leading me down a dimly lit hallway. "There's more you need to see," he said. "Something Sebastian will find particularly... enlightening."

We stopped in front of another door. Damian opened it, revealing a workshop where masked figures hunched over welding stations. At first, I didn’t understand what they were crafting—until I stepped closer.

A tiny mechanical bee rested on the table, its wings delicate, its body unnervingly lifelike.

"Recognize it now?" Damian smirked. "This little creation flies straight to its target and detonates. Releases a sleeping agent so potent, it can knock someone out for hours—or permanently."

I swallowed hard, my eyes darting to the shelves lining the walls. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of these artificial insects sat in perfect rows, waiting. If one were placed beside a real bee, I doubted anyone could tell the difference.

"You'll like the next room," Dominic said with a dark chuckle, steering me toward another door.

Damian swung it open, and Dominic nudged me inside.

A sleek, black bird perched on the table, motionless. Opposite it, a blank screen loomed. To the left, an intricate map of our pack’s territory was pinned to the wall—complete with marked tunnels, labeled locations like the training grounds and the packhouse.

But it was the bird that sent a chill down my spine.

With trembling fingers, I lifted it. The moment it left the table, the screen flickered to life. The higher I raised it, the clearer the realization became—this wasn’t a bird.

It was a drone.

Meticulously designed to mimic a real one, down to the subtle feather textures. Even if we were scanning for surveillance, no one would suspect a simple bird in the sky.

Turning it over, I spotted the tiny camera lens embedded in its chest. It whirred softly, adjusting its focus—directly on my face.

"I control it with this," Dominic said, stepping forward with a modified Xbox controller in hand. He demonstrated, making the drone tilt, zoom, and hover with effortless precision.

"What’s its range?" I asked, my voice barely steady.

"Three miles," Damian answered. "Enough to cover your entire territory without detection."

The implications settled over me like a suffocating weight.

They weren’t just preparing for war.

They were ensuring they’d win.

###Chapter 0245

The tension in the air was palpable. Their expressions told me everything - I wasn't going to like what came next. The dim hallway echoed with approaching footsteps, their rapid pace sending chills down my spine. I braced for screams, but only eerie silence answered.

Dominic swung the door open as Alpha Damian pressed a finger to his lips, commanding silence. Darkness swallowed the room except for a single chair at its center.

"Alpha Damian, you summoned me?"

"Indeed, Gregory. Come in. I believe you're acquainted with our guest." A heavy thud preceded blinding lights. Oliver lay sprawled on the floor, his face upturned. "Though perhaps you haven't met Ms. Evelyn properly. Allow me to introduce your new Luna." Alpha Damian yanked my hair forward into the light.

Elliott stood frozen before me. To his credit, his expression remained unreadable. "I don't recognize these people," he said, confusion lacing his voice.

Alpha Damian nodded to his warriors who seized Elliott, dragging him toward the chair. "I'd hoped this would be civil."

"What's happening?" Elliott shouted.

"Gregory..." Alpha Damian began.

"Father...don't forget his true name." Dominic's voice behind me made me jump. His hands gripped my hips, pulling me against him. "Relax, darling. This won't take long, and I'll comfort you afterward," he whispered, his breath hot against my ear.

His lips brushed my neck as my fists clenched. Rage burned through me. I felt his arousal pressing against me, but thankfully his attention shifted to the unfolding scene.

"Correct. Elliott..." Alpha Damian clapped dramatically. Once restrained, a warrior sprayed mist in Elliott's face, suppressing his wolf.

Elliott's face darkened with anger. "Explain this madness!"

Alpha Damian snapped his fingers. Lights flickered to reveal a baseball pitching machine positioned directly before Elliott. Recognition dawned on Elliott's face as he struggled against his bonds.

The machine hummed to life under Alpha Damian's touch. "Here's how this works. I'll ask questions..."

At one point, I glimpsed the display: 105mph.

Warriors tore Elliott's shirt away, slicing through his pants until only boxers remained. "Were you planted as Benjamin's spy?"

"Just kill me! You'll get nothing from me!" Elliott spat, eyes locked on the machine as Alpha Damian loaded a ball. The projectile struck Elliott's stomach with a sickening thud. He doubled over, spittle flying from his mouth in agony. When he straightened, an angry blue welt marked the impact point, the ball's stitches imprinted on his skin.

"I already knew that answer," Alpha Damian mused. "You see, Evelyn... Elliott was your father-in-law's mole. But I'd installed spyware on his phone, intercepting every message. That's how I've stayed steps ahead of Benjamin. I knew about the garage attack and relocated everything beforehand." His triumphant smile turned my stomach.

###Chapter 0246

So Elliott didn't betray us after all. Alpha Damian had outsmarted the spy. "I thought you worked with Isabella to kidnap me?"

"Ah, your mind is truly remarkable." Alpha Damian approached me, placing his hand on my head like my father used to. "We did, in fact. You see, Dominic was actually Isabella's mate."

I gasped, stumbling backward in shock. Dominic merely smirked. "Why so surprised? Isabella was... entertaining, but her heart belonged to Sebastian. And I wanted you. It all worked out perfectly. She revealed the pre-existing tunnel system to us."

"Our own tunnels weren't fully operational yet," Alpha Damian continued, moving toward the machine. "We hadn't completed all our data collection. Using her suggested route was the logical choice."

"Did you two reject each other?" I asked, my voice trembling.

Dominic shook his head. "No rejection. Neither of us wanted to risk our wolves. As long as she stays away, I couldn't care less what she does. Though I hear she's currently in your cells, so her options are limited." His gaze locked onto mine. "Everything's worked out perfectly. I keep my wolf, avoid the pain of her... activities, and still get to have you."

"Now that you know the truth," Alpha Damian held up a metal sphere, "would you like to administer punishment for his lack of awareness?"

"No!" I pressed myself against the cold wall.

"Suit yourself." With terrifying calm, Alpha Damian activated the device. The sphere struck Elliott square in the chest. His agonized screams filled the room as his face turned purple.

"Any other questions?" Alpha Damian's voice pulled my attention from Elliott's suffering.

"The rogues. Why send them after me?"

"My incompetent son still has much to learn about efficiency." Alpha Damian shot Dominic a disapproving look.

"Why me? It can't just be about my appearance." My eyes darted between the two men. They exchanged knowing smiles.

"We have a... special situation," Alpha Damian tossed a sphere to a nearby warrior. "And you're uniquely qualified to assist. Clean this up. I want no traces left."



Dominic's grip tightened around my arm as he dragged me out. No one bothered with Oliver, leaving him crumpled on the floor. The heavy door slammed shut, muffling Elliott's tortured cries.

We navigated a maze of corridors before entering a room dominated by an enormous screen stretching wall to wall. Images flashed across it - buildings, faces, blueprints. Everyone I cared about was cataloged there, each photo accompanied by unreadable notes.

"This is the M.A.R.C. room - Midnight Aerial Reconnaissance Command." Alpha Damian's lips curled at the irony. "State-of-the-art surveillance technology. Lately, I've been focusing on someone... special to me."

The screen filled with Audrey's face. "What?"

"Life lessons," Alpha Damian mused. "I currently have no mate. Not because she died, but because she never completed the bond. I marked her enough to survive, but retained my free will. She's safe, but that's irrelevant now. What matters is what happened during our first year together."

"Stupid bitch," Dominic muttered, slumping into a chair like a petulant child.

###Chapter 0247

"Anyway..." Alpha Damian took a deep breath, deliberately ignoring his son. "Do you recognize the name Alpha Nathaniel?"

"Isn't that your father?" I asked, trying to recall.

"Close, but no. That's the most common misconception people make. Alpha Nathaniel was actually my mate's father. Vivienne was the only child born to him. When he met his... unfortunate demise, Vivienne took over as Alpha. But since I was her mate, she eventually agreed to transfer the Alpha title to me."

A sickening feeling twisted in my gut at the way he said agreed. Knowing him, he had likely abused her—emotionally, physically, and mentally. "Oh no," I whispered.

"You catch on quick!" Alpha Damian snapped his fingers. "However, Vivienne had a lover she was deeply attached to. When I met her, she was already five weeks pregnant. Terrified for her unborn child, she tried to pass it off as mine. But when the baby was born—" His lips curled into a sneer. "—she looked exactly like her real father."

He clicked a button, and a man's face appeared on the screen beside Audrey. The resemblance was uncanny—she was practically his mirror image. My earlier suspicion was confirmed—that photo of Elliott and him at the bar had been right all along.

"Do you know anything about werewolf law, Evelyn?" Alpha Damian's tone shifted, no longer amused.

"The firstborn of Alpha blood is the sole heir to the title," I said flatly. That made Audrey the rightful heir to Nightshade Pack.

"Exactly." His eyes darkened. "I ordered that baby killed. My greatest regret is not doing it myself when I first laid eyes on the little brat—but that's another story. Vivienne, however, managed to warn her lover, and together, they smuggled the child out. It took me years to track her down."

"I'm confused. Why did you build tunnels to Alpha Benjamin's pack if Audrey was your target?"

"Ah, now that's the million-dollar question." Alpha Damian stood and began pacing. "You see, Audrey's father has been working with the very same man currently being tenderized by a baseball machine. They've been allies under Alpha Benjamin for decades. Slippery little snake. When my idiot son wanted to use rogues, he asked Elliott to arrange an attack to make an impact. Elliott, still playing both sides, had Xavier—yes, that's his name—organize an ambush to kidnap you. We planned to trade you for Audrey, but—" He shot Dominic a furious glare. "—THIS IS WHY WE DON’T FUCKING USE ROGUES!"

"Let me get this straight," I said slowly. "The tunnels were built as part of a long-term plan to take down Alpha Benjamin when the time was right, but you've also been hunting Xavier for years. So, you kidnapped me to force a trade for Audrey—kill her so Dominic could take over as Alpha, lure Xavier out, and with Audrey now mated to Grayson, you'd control all three packs?"

"Isn't it beautiful when years of planning finally come together?"

"Plans change," Dominic interjected, rising to his feet. "After seeing you, I wanted you as my mate. If I kill Sebastian, I'll be named Alpha of his pack without a full-scale attack—or we could still go that route."

"Long story short—kill Audrey, Sebastian, and Grayson, and claim all this territory for yourself," I summarized.

"Correct." Alpha Damian smirked. "But we do need your help with programming this." He pressed another button, revealing a live aerial view of Crimson Fang Pack, the entire territory marked with a red target.

The worst part? It was all happening in real time.

###Chapter 0248
Warning! Disturbing content ahead!

My breath hitched. "What?"

"Since you've gathered everyone in one pack, it'll be easiest to level the entire place." Alpha Damian smirked. "I've acquired a massive explosive. Unfortunately, we haven't cracked their firewalls yet. To detonate it, I need a nine-digit password. That's where you come in."

My stomach twisted as I watched tiny figures moving around the pack grounds. They looked like distant specks, but they were real people—innocent lives.

"Why would I ever help you?" I spat.

"I thought you might need some... motivation." Damian snapped his fingers, and the screen flickered to a gruesome image. Oliver. His face was unrecognizable—bruised, swollen, missing teeth, deep gashes marring his body. If I hadn't known it was him, I wouldn’t have recognized him at all.

The warriors untied him, letting his body collapse onto the floor. They dragged him aside, then two more warriors appeared, dragging someone else—someone fighting back. After a few brutal punches, they forced him into a chair and tied him down. My heart stopped.

Sebastian.

"No..." I stumbled back, my legs threatening to give out.

"You can stop this," Dominic said, stepping closer.

"How?" My voice cracked as I watched a baseball slam into Sebastian’s shoulder.

"Choose me. Carry my pup, not Sebastian’s." Dominic’s grin was predatory. "We won’t mark each other, so it doesn’t matter if you reject him later. And honestly? I’d rather your wolf stay alive. So, agree to be mine."

My mind raced. Either I let him have his way and save Sebastian, or I’d watch Sebastian be beaten to death—and still end up forced into Dominic’s arms. There was no way in hell I’d let either happen. But fear and fury warred inside me, leaving me frozen.

"STOP HURTING HIM!" I screamed as another blow landed on Sebastian’s eye. Blood splattered.

"Good choice." Damian pressed a button. "Enough," he commanded into the mic.

Sebastian slumped forward, gasping in relief. His breathing was ragged, but at least the torture had ceased.

"Glad you see things my way." Dominic smirked. "Father has business to attend to, so let’s make sure you don’t change your mind."



"What about Sebastian?" I demanded, struggling to stay upright.

"Losing your wolf really made you clumsy," Dominic sneered.

That’s when I realized—he thought I’d been sprayed with wolfsbane. I hadn’t. A sliver of hope flickered. If he underestimated me, maybe I had a chance. But how?

"Where are you taking me?" I pretended to stumble, scanning my surroundings for any advantage.

"Prepared for your compliance, I set up a private spot for us." His grip tightened on my arm. "Prove your loyalty. Disappoint me, and my father resumes with Sebastian."

I clenched my jaw. Stay strong. Play along. Wait for the right moment. Sebastian’s face flashed in my mind—his voice echoed, telling me to survive. This wasn’t over.

"Here we are." Dominic shoved me against the wall, knocking the air from my lungs. His lips crushed mine, his hands tearing at my clothes. My bra was exposed, his fingers digging painfully into my skin. I could feel him pressed against me, his intent clear.

###Chapter 0249

My voice trembled as I spoke. "S-shouldn’t we go inside?" His lips trailed down my neck, sending shivers through me. Every fiber of my being screamed to push him away, but I forced myself to stay still.

"You're right." Dominic's voice was dark with desire. "I want you beneath me." He unlocked the door and shoved me inside. My eyes darted around—just a bare mattress and chains bolted to the wall before he threw me onto it.

Before I could react, he flipped me onto my back, his weight pinning me down. My romper tore under his grip, the fabric shredding instantly. Panic surged through me as his rough hands roamed my body. A whimper escaped my lips before fury ignited inside me.

"NO!" I screamed, freezing him in place. His head had been inches from between my thighs, forcing them apart.

His grin was cruel as he leaned up. "What? You rejecting me?" His palm cracked across my mouth before I could blink. The metallic taste of blood filled my mouth as I glared at him.

"I didn’t say that!" I lied quickly. "I—I prefer to be on top."

"Fine." Dominic stood, stripping off his shirt and pants before yanking down his underwear. His erection sprang free, and I couldn’t help but compare—Sebastian was thicker, longer, better.

"Let’s see what that pretty mouth can do." He sprawled on the mattress, watching as I shifted beside him.

My hands shook as I reached for the chains. "I want to use these."

Dominic’s grip crushed my wrist. A sickening snap echoed as bones gave way. "Don’t even think about it."

Cradling my injured hand, I scrambled for a plan. My wolf snarled, ready to fight. I knew I’d heal, but I needed an advantage.

"Suck it." He fisted my hair, slamming my face against his length. His claws raked down my hip, leaving deep gashes along my thigh. "Get your ass over here."

Desperate to avoid penetration, I wrapped my hand around him and took him into my mouth. His groan was sharp as his grip loosened. Tears blurred my vision as he forced himself deeper.

Then—my fangs descended.

I bit down hard.

Blood flooded my mouth as he howled, twisting to throw me off. But I held on, my teeth tearing through flesh. His fists pounded my ribs before he finally ripped me away, my fangs leaving jagged wounds along his shaft.



"What about Oliver?" I gasped, struggling to stand.

Dominic laughed. "Guess losing your wolf made you clumsy." He thinks I was sprayed. The realization gave me a sliver of hope—but escaping was another matter.

"Where are you taking me?" I stumbled deliberately, scanning for exits.

"I prepared a special spot." His grin was vicious. "Prove you’re honest, or my father finishes Oliver."

I clenched my jaw. Stay strong. Wait for his weakness. Sebastian’s face flashed in my mind—just survive. This wasn’t the end.

"Here we are!" Dominic slammed me against the wall, knocking the air from my lungs. His lips crushed mine as he tore the rest of my romper away. His fingers dug into my skin, his arousal pressing against me.

###Chapter 0250

"She's gone!"

"Dominic is dead!"

"FIND HER! I WANT HER BREATHING!" Alpha Damian's voice thundered through the corridors as the door handle rattled violently. "SEARCH EVERY INCH OF THIS PLACE! SHE CAN'T HAVE DISAPPEARED!" The shouts echoed as boots pounded against the floor, scattering in all directions.

As the footsteps faded, I finally took in the room I'd stumbled into. Empty. Just three office chairs and a flimsy folding table—nothing useful. Not even a damn fire extinguisher to swing at someone.

I pressed my ear against the door. Silence. Slowly, I turned the lock and peeked out. No fear—just rage. My wolf snarled beneath my skin, claws itching to tear into flesh.

Barefoot and clad in nothing but my underwear, I slipped into the hallway, moving like a shadow. Then, something red caught my eye. Without thinking, I yanked the fire alarm.

The blaring siren erupted instantly, red lights spinning like a warning. Shouts erupted from nearby rooms as men scrambled into the halls. I ducked low, weaving through the chaos, retracing the path Dominic had dragged me down.

Every time I spotted an opening, another guard rounded the corner. My pulse hammered, but they were too distracted to notice me.

"WHERE IS SHE?" Damian's roar shook the walls.

Shit.

I grabbed the nearest door—locked. The next one—locked. "Damn it!" I hissed.

"That bitch is done playing games!" His footsteps were closing in.

"Sir! Movement on the northern perimeter!" The footsteps halted.

"What?" Damian's voice was lethally calm.

"Cameras picked up something near the fence line."

"Do I have to do everything myself?" he bellowed. "Find her, or I'll skin you alive." His heavy steps faded away.

My wolf flexed her claws, sensing danger. Right on cue, a warrior rounded the corner. His eyes widened—but I was faster. My claws slashed across his throat before he could scream. Blood sprayed as he crumpled to his knees. No time to hide the mess.

Oliver was just ahead. I crept forward, scanning the empty hallway. Luck, or maybe the Moon Goddess, was finally on my side.

The door was unlocked. I slipped inside—relief lasted half a second.

A warrior stood there, baseball bat in hand.

Oliver met my gaze, then flicked his eyes to the guard. He was battered—one eye swollen shut, bruises littering his chest—but alive.

The warrior dropped the bat and lunged.

###Chapter 0251

Even with my wolf's strength, weeks of inactivity had left me weak. Every muscle screamed in protest as I dodged another attack. Oliver's instructions barely registered as I focused solely on avoiding the next blow.

His hands suddenly gripped me, and my body went airborne.

The impact against the wall sent a sharp crack through my spine before I slid to the floor.

"Damn it." I groaned, but there was no time to recover. My eyes locked onto the warrior reaching for his radio—no doubt to alert Alpha Damian of my location.

I lunged.

My wolf propelled me forward, my legs coiling like springs before I landed on his back. A single, brutal twist snapped his neck before his finger could press the call button.

As he collapsed, I staggered back, my breath ragged. Crawling to the door, I locked it—just in case someone came to check on the commotion.

"Evelyn..." Oliver's voice finally broke through the haze.

Leaning against the wall, I struggled to steady my breathing.

The moment he said my name, my gaze met his single visible eye. "We... need to get out... of here." A sharp pain flared in my side—probably a fractured rib.

"Where are we?"

"No idea." Gripping the door handle, I forced myself up, ignoring my body's protests. Adrenaline kept me moving, but I was painfully aware of how out of shape I was.

Once steady, I moved to Oliver, working quickly to free him from the chains. They clattered to the ground, and he slumped forward with a groan, clutching his chest.

"Shit..."

"Come on. We need to get you to a hospital." I gritted my teeth, swallowing the cry of pain threatening to escape. Oliver needed me more than I needed to acknowledge my injury.

"How do we get out?" he asked through clenched teeth.

"Fast." I helped him toward the door.

"I mean, which way?"

My hand hovered over the knob.

"No clue, but we can't stay here." Glancing at Oliver, we were both barely clothed, covered in blood, leaning on each other for support. "Ready?"

"As I'll ever be."

I yanked the door open.

Without hesitation, we turned left and ran.

Every step was agony—between my ribs and supporting Oliver's weight, I barely registered the sharp objects cutting into my bare feet. But I didn't stop.

"THERE SHE IS!"

A shout echoed behind us.

"Don't look back—just go!" Oliver barked.

A stairwell sign loomed ahead. We crashed through the door, momentum nearly sending us tumbling down the steep steps.

"Down!" I urged, and we descended as fast as we could.

We made it one flight before the door above burst open with a deafening bang. Concrete dust rained down as the guards shouted into their radios.

"She's on the stairs! Heading to the third level!"

I didn't slow.

Oliver's foot caught on a step, and we tumbled. A sickening snap echoed, followed by his cry of pain. His ankle twisted unnaturally, sending him crashing down again. My knee hit the floor hard.

"F*ck!" Oliver clutched his ankle.

"Sorry." Without hesitation, I grabbed his foot and jerked it back into place.

"HOLY SH*T, EVELYN!" he snarled.

Ignoring his outburst, I hauled him up. The guards were closing in as I dragged him toward the exit door, its red letters glowing like a beacon.

###Chapter 0252

"RUN, OLIVER!" I screamed as we burst through the door. The cold night air hit us like a wall, the wind tearing at my hair and stinging the fresh cuts on my skin. The back alley was deserted—nothing but scattered trash cans and parked cars, no place to hide. We barely made it twenty feet before the door slammed open again.

"Sweet, naive Evelyn." Alpha Damian's voice slithered down my spine like ice. We froze in our tracks. Turning slowly, I saw the glint of gun barrels in the moonlight. "I must say, I underestimated you." He stood framed in the doorway, flanked by armed men, all waiting for his command. "You murdered my son." His face twisted with barely contained rage.

"You killed Dominic?" Oliver gasped, staring at me in shock.

"Tore his heart out with my bare hands," I spat. "Maybe next time, check if your victims are dosed before sending them to be assaulted by your disgusting offspring."

"Then I won't hesitate to return the favor when I end your miserable life," Damian snarled, loading a revolver with deliberate slowness.

"If you kill Oliver or me, I won't help you," I said, gripping my only bargaining chip.

"We'll see about that." Damian jerked his chin at someone behind us. Hands clamped around my throat and Oliver's, dragging us backward into the building.

As they hauled us inside, my mind raced. I could shift into Luna, but she'd be an easy target—too big, too exposed. Oliver was defenseless, his injured ankle making him stumble as they shoved him forward.

Distracted, I missed the first step and crashed onto the stairs. "Pathetic little bitch!" A warrior growled before driving his fist into my already broken ribs. The pain stole my breath, but I refused to scream.

Luna surged forward, claws unsheathing as the warrior bent to grab me. With one swift slash, I opened his throat. Blood sprayed across my face.

"Evelyn!" Oliver shouted.

I barely had time to turn before Damian's fist connected with my temple.

The world blurred. Darkness pulsed at the edges of my vision as Damian threw me over his shoulder and carried me upstairs. Blood—mine or someone else's—dripped into my eyes.

He dumped me onto rough carpet, the fibers scraping my skin. All I could think was how much this was going to hurt later.

"IT'S NOT FUCKING ROCKET SCIENCE!" Damian roared, yanking me up by my hair.

"PAY ATTENTION!" His slap snapped my head to the side.

"Go... to hell..." I choked out between ragged breaths.

"Good girl," he sneered, shoving me into a chair. "Now. Give me the goddamn code."

In front of me was a keypad with symbols I didn’t recognize, nine empty boxes waiting for input. "I'm not a hacker," I said.

"Wrong answer." The click of his gun hammer cocking made my blood run cold. I turned just in time to see him aim at Oliver's already shattered ankle and fire.

"FUCK!" Oliver collapsed, clutching his leg.

"I. Want. The. Code." Damian's eyes were black pits of fury. "Next is his knee. Then his other leg. Then his arms. Keep talking, and I’ll take him apart piece by piece."

###Chapter 0253

"Stop." Oliver stared at me with his one good eye. Fear and resignation radiated from his battered body. My stomach twisted as Alpha Damian slammed the pistol against Oliver's temple. He didn't lose consciousness, but his vision swam. A warrior tore off a strip of duct tape and sealed his mouth shut.

"Now," Alpha Damian growled, his voice dripping with menace. "Give me the damn code."

My fingers hovered over the keyboard, the screen flashing the emblem of the United States. "Stolen from humans?" I scoffed, pressing enter. I was smart, but hacking wasn't my specialty. Covering my tracks? Impossible.

Damian cocked the gun. "Got a problem with that?" His tone was deceptively calm.

"Not mine to have." I swallowed, hyperaware of the eyes burning into my back. Deep breath. Focus. I'd taken coding classes—enough to fake it.

Some kid had once accidentally hacked our high school system by clicking the wrong thing. I just had to do the same… but on a national scale. My fingers danced across the keys, navigating through layers of firewalls. Whoever had tried before had gotten stuck.

I rerouted the URL to another server.

"You can't do that!" A warrior leaned over my shoulder, his breath hot on my neck. "It won't work!"

Annoyance and fear coiled in my chest. If he understood what I was doing, he’d realize I was sabotaging this.

"Alpha Damian," I said flatly, turning. "Shoot him."

A dark chuckle escaped Damian. "Excuse me?"

"I don’t need a backseat hacker telling me what won’t work when he couldn’t even do it."

It was a joke.

Until the gunshot cracked through the air.

I flinched as the warrior collapsed, his knees hitting the ground before his body followed. His glare never left me, even as his last breath left his lips.

"Continue," Damian ordered.

My hands trembled, but I forced myself to focus—for Oliver. A glance confirmed he was still breathing, though blood streaked his face. His eyes were closed, his body too still.

Five more minutes. That’s all it took to breach the firewall. Numbers and letters flooded the screen, scrolling too fast to read. I wasn’t searching for the code—I was creating chaos, praying someone would notice.

"You’re taking too long," Damian snapped, impatience sharpening his tone.

"I’m not grabbing milk from the store," I hissed through clenched teeth. "I told you—I’m not a hacker. Give me a damn minute."

"Work faster," he whispered, leaning in, "or Oliver loses a kneecap to match his ankle."

"I’m trying!" I jerked away, fingers flying.

Then—a voice.

"Luna. Can you hear me?"

My heart leapt. "YES!"

Damian’s eyes narrowed. "What was that?"

"I’m freezing," I lied. "I’m in a bra and underwear."

BAM.

Oliver screamed.

My stomach dropped as fresh blood poured from his knee.

###Chapter 0254

"What the hell?"

"You're not working fast enough. Clearly, you need more motivation." Alpha Damian cocked the gun again and leaned down to Oliver's level. "Next one goes through his heart."

"I'm working!" I snapped, my fingers flying over the keyboard.

"Listen. We've got the building surrounded." The voice in my mind-link was calm, but I could sense the urgency beneath it.

"I'll keep them distracted as long as I can, but you need to move quietly. They already know you're coming." My hands trembled as I tried to access the hidden link. A single number flashed on the screen—8. I typed it into the first box, and Alpha Damian smirked in satisfaction.

"Alpha Damian, we're being surrounded. They're not friendlies." A warrior burst through the door, the sudden light blinding us for a second.

"Handle it," Damian ordered without looking up. Two warriors followed the first out, leaving four still in the room.

As I worked through another algorithm, my pulse pounded in my ears. Finally, the U.S. military responded. Sebastian had embedded the codes so deeply that only someone who knew exactly what to look for would find them.

-Request acknowledged. Follow instructions.-

Relief flooded through me. I had been terrified they wouldn’t see it—or worse, that I’d messed it up. Clicking the link, I was taken to another screen that looked identical, except this one contained false data.

Another message appeared—coordinates. The military wanted me to simulate an attack, buying us time.

"The U.S. military is on their way. We need to get out now," I mind-linked Grayson.

"Grayson says we're clear. He's coming, but we have to stall."

"There's a bomb here. If it detonates—"

"We're not leaving without you," came the immediate reply.

More numbers flashed—4, then 2. I could feel Damian's presence looming over me, his breath hot on my neck. At this point, faking struggle was easy. I typed random nonsense, but he hung on every keystroke.

O appeared next, followed by another 8. Just four more numbers. With Damian watching, I had to get creative. I sent another message—ETA?

Gunfire and growls echoed through the building. We had breached. The walls vibrated with the sounds of battle. The warriors shifted nervously, but Damian’s focus remained locked on me. His hand clamped down on my shoulder, fingers digging in.

"That's it. Faster," he growled.

7 appeared. I entered it, stealing a glance at Oliver. His face was swollen, bloodied, but his one good eye met mine. I couldn’t read his expression, but I knew what he was thinking—that I was helping Damian.

3… 9…

"One more," Damian breathed, excitement lacing his voice.

The moment the last digit appeared, I slammed my fist onto the LAUNCH button.

The screen flashed green. The sound of ignition filled the room. My heart hammered—until it all died. A red X filled the screen, a skull beneath it, and the U.S. military logo.

"You… little… bitch." Damian’s voice was deadly quiet.

I had already dropped to the floor, scrambling back. He slowly turned his head toward me, fury twisting his features into something unrecognizable.

Standing, he threw his head back and laughed. "What happened?" a warrior demanded.

"Tell them," Damian ordered, waving his gun.

"I contacted the military. They gave me a code to permanently disable the bomb. It’s useless now." I smiled, even as fear clawed at my throat. "You can kill us, but I won’t let you slaughter my family. They’re coming. You should run."

"Oh, we’ll leave," Damian said smoothly. "But you won’t. Starting with him." He turned the gun on Oliver.

My wolf snapped.

Everything slowed. The gun fired just as Luna lunged. I didn’t see if Oliver was alive—my focus was Damian.

He threw me aside, shifting into the largest pure-black wolf I’d ever seen. His eyes were voids, blending into his fur as he circled me. I held my ground, keeping myself between him and Oliver. The other warriors had shifted but stayed back—likely under his command.

Damian lunged. Luna reacted instantly, swiping at his muzzle. A shallow cut, but enough to draw blood.

He was an Alpha.

But Luna was something more.

Power radiated from her—terrifying, beautiful. She shook out her fur and unleashed a bone-chilling growl.

###Chapter 0255

Alpha Damian didn’t hesitate. His fist flew toward me.

Luna met him mid-air, her claws slashing. A brutal kick to his ribs sent him stumbling, but not before his palm cracked against her muzzle. Teeth snapped inches from her throat as they crashed to the ground.

The building groaned beneath them. This place wasn’t made for werewolf combat.

Damian lunged again.

Luna twisted, evading his strike. She danced around him, taunting, exhausting him—anything to keep him from reaching Oliver. But the room was too small. Oliver lay motionless, his breathing shallow.

A feint toward Oliver. Luna blocked it, but her right side was exposed.

Damian struck.

His fangs sank deep into her hip, piercing muscle. She snarled, raking her claws across his stomach. Three deep gashes bloomed red, but he didn’t let go. His jaws clamped harder.

Bone crunched.

Luna threw her weight forward, crushing him beneath her. The impact forced his lungs to empty. The floor beneath them splintered, the carpet the only thing keeping them from falling through.

Her eyes locked with Oliver’s.

A silent understanding passed between them.

With one swift slash, Luna severed the carpet.

They plummeted.

The door burst open just as her head disappeared below. Gunfire erupted—our warriors had arrived.

Luna landed hard on Damian, breaking her fall. She scrambled up, expecting another attack.

But Damian wasn’t moving.

A jagged wooden shard protruded from his neck. His body trembled, shifting back into human form.

Black rage burned in his eyes as he clawed at the wound.

Luna didn’t give him the chance.

Her paw crushed his hand, bones snapping. Blood pooled beneath him.

She wouldn’t risk it.

Her claws tore into his chest, ripping until his heart pulsed in her grip.

The door exploded inward.

Military personnel flooded the room, weapons raised. Their eyes widened at the sight—Luna, drenched in blood, Damian’s heart clutched in her jaws.

"Identify yourself!" A soldier barked, rifle aimed at her skull.

"She’s with us!" Maxwell shoved through the humans, stripping off his vest and shirt. He tossed the fabric at her paws. "Turn around."

The soldiers obeyed.

Luna shifted back, pulling on Maxwell’s shirt. It barely covered her thighs.

"Oliver!" She whirled, panic clawing at her throat.

"He’s being evacuated. Move!" Maxwell grabbed her arm, dragging her toward the exit.

This time, she didn’t resist.

They sprinted down the hall, boots pounding against the stairs. Outside, two soldiers carried Oliver toward a waiting vehicle.

Nathan sprinted toward them, his face paling at the sight of Oliver’s injuries.

"Medic! Now!" His voice left no room for argument.

A doctor rushed forward, gloved hands already assessing. His expression darkened.

"Call for a med-evac. Internal bleeding. Bullets still lodged in his knee and ankle."

Oliver’s gaze flickered to Luna.

"You’ll be fine," she whispered, forcing strength into her voice.

The gurney arrived. They loaded him up, rushing him under a medical tent.

Luna stood frozen.

A blanket draped over her shoulders snapped her back to reality. Maxwell had returned, another group of prisoners in tow.

"Do you need to sit? Water?"

"No." Her voice was steel. "Report."

He hesitated. "Luna, maybe you should—"

"Give me the damn report."

Maxwell exhaled but nodded. "Alpha Damian is confirmed dead. Dominic—"

"I know how Dominic died. Continue."

His eyes flicked to her bloodstained hands but he wisely didn’t ask.

###Chapter 0256

"All surrendering members are restrained and being transported here for processing. They'll be placed in holding cells until Alpha Grayson or Alpha Sebastian arrives to make the final decision."

The last part grated on my nerves, but I chose to let it slide. "I assume Elliott was killed in the confrontation."

"Affirmative, Luna. His remains are being transported along with the other casualties."

"No. Separate his body from the others. He wasn't a traitor."

"Luna?" Maxwell's brow furrowed in confusion.

"For the last time, Maxwell, either follow my orders or face the consequences." My growing headache made his questioning particularly unwelcome.

"Understood, Luna."

"Additionally, I want a man named Xavier brought to me immediately."

Maxwell's reaction was almost comical. "Xavier?"

"Correct. If he's among the prisoners - which I doubt - I want him delivered to me personally." My instincts were screaming at me.

"But I don't-"

"Figure it out, Maxwell! Use that brain of yours!" I could feel my wolf rising to the surface.

"Yes, Luna." He bowed before moving toward the prisoner line.

Three helicopters appeared on the horizon, racing toward us. As they neared, the rotor wash whipped my hair wildly about my face. The tent flaps snapped violently, striking anyone who ventured too close. But my attention was riveted on the medical team emerging from the first aircraft.

Oliver looked like a nightmare - tubes protruding from his throat and arms, a massive chest drain leaking crimson onto the dirt below. All three medics were drenched in blood from the waist down. The sheer volume made me wonder if any remained in his body.

As the helicopters touched down, the medical team rushed toward waiting personnel. The moment Oliver was transferred, his helicopter lifted off again. More medical staff disembarked, but it was the two figures sprinting toward me that finally cracked my composure.

My legs refused to move. Despite my desperate need to run to them, I stood frozen. Grayson held back while Sebastian charged forward, his gaze never leaving mine. Only when Sebastian reached me did my paralysis break - he swept me into his arms, and I clung to him like a lifeline, wrapping every limb around him with what little strength I had left.

"I'm so sorry," Sebastian murmured against my ear before pulling back to crush his lips against mine, then holding me tight again.

"Don't be. I told them to take me. I'm fine." Hysteria threatened to surface, but I ruthlessly suppressed it. That wasn't me. That wasn't who I chose to be. I refused to let those emotions win.

"Did he hurt you?" Sebastian set me down and yanked away the blanket, his eyes darkening when he saw Maxwell's shirt on me.

"I'm healing. My wolf has been working overtime. Nothing I haven't handled before."

"Evelyn." Grayson's voice sounded aged beyond years. When I turned, he looked like he'd aged decades in hours.

I embraced him, feeling the tension drain from his body as he held me.

"Why the hell did you go with them?" Grayson released me, his anger born from fear and love.

"Because that's what a Luna does for her pack. If our positions were reversed, you would have gone without hesitation to protect Audrey." I cupped his face, and he closed his eyes with a reluctant nod.

"Just... don't do that again," Grayson muttered.

Sebastian grabbed my arm, forcing me to meet his gaze. "I'd rather die than watch that happen again. Do you understand me?"

"Oh look, my boys think they can give me orders!" I smirked before brushing my lips against his. "Come on, we have much to discuss."

As I took Sebastian's hand to find privacy, a shout froze me in my tracks. "LUNA!"

###Chapter 0257

We all turned as Maxwell approached, dragging a man in handcuffs.

"What's this?" Sebastian demanded, irritation flashing in his eyes.

"Is this who you wanted?" Maxwell shoved the man to his knees, gripping his hair and yanking his head back.

"Son of a bitch!" Grayson snarled, stepping forward.

"Wait!" I threw my arm out to stop him. "Maxwell, release him."

Maxwell hesitated, glancing at Sebastian for confirmation.

That was it. I was done being ignored.

Releasing Sebastian, I crossed the distance in three quick strides and drove my fist straight into Maxwell's nose. He barely flinched, too stunned to react.

"Whoa! What the hell?" Sebastian moved between us.

"Listen carefully, Maxwell," I hissed, my voice low and dangerous. "I am your Luna. You will obey me. Disrespect me again, and I won't hesitate to remind you of your place."

My aura flared, silencing the camp.

Maxwell knelt, blood dripping from his nose as he looked up at me.

"Yes, Luna."

"Good. Now get back to work."

I pulled my aura back, and Maxwell stood, leaving without another glance at Sebastian.

Grayson looked between us, bewildered. "Scarlett, what's going on?"

"Xavier," I said sharply. "Stand up and follow me."

Xavier blinked in surprise but obeyed, rising to his feet. Still cuffed, he fell into step behind me while Grayson walked beside him and Sebastian stayed close to me.

No one spoke until we reached a private tent.

Sebastian crossed his arms, his expression unreadable. "Explain."

I faced Xavier. "Do you know who I am?"

He nodded. "I do."

"And them?" I gestured to Sebastian and Grayson.

"Yes, ma'am."

"Grayson," I said without looking away from Xavier, "this is Audrey's father."

Xavier stiffened but stayed silent.

Grayson's composure cracked. "What?"

He stepped closer, studying Xavier's face—his unkempt beard, the tangled hair that hid his features.

"Xavier isn't the traitor you think he was," I said, taking a seat. "Neither was Elliott."

"Elliott never betrayed anyone!" Xavier snapped, anger flashing in his eyes.

"I know." I kept my gaze locked on him. "Elliott was working undercover for Benjamin. But these two made a deal based on one shared goal."

I leaned forward. "Alpha Damian has a mate who's very much alive. Before she found him, she had a lover."

Xavier's breath hitched. His eyes darted away.

"She... she's still alive?"

"She is."

"Who is she?" Grayson demanded.

"Her name was Vivienne," I said. "Daughter of Alpha Nathaniel. The only child of Nathaniel and Audrey's mother."

Sebastian and Grayson both froze.

"WHAT?" Grayson roared before forcing himself to calm.

"When Damian found Vivienne, she was already pregnant. She tried to pass the child off as his, but the resemblance was undeniable. Damian discovered the truth and had the baby taken away."

I held Xavier's gaze. "For the past nineteen years, Xavier has been undercover in Damian's pack, protecting Audrey from being killed."

Sebastian rubbed his temples. "I'm so lost."

"Damian wanted Dominic to take over the pack when he died," I explained. "But werewolf law states the firstborn inherits the title. Audrey is older than Dominic. That makes her the rightful heir—not him. Dominic only becomes Alpha if Audrey dies."

I exhaled sharply. "Damian knew Elliott was a spy because he hacked his phone. He read every message Elliott sent to Benjamin. That's why he left the garage—he was warned. Damian's plan was to slaughter everyone and take control of all three packs."

Grayson's jaw clenched. "The tunnels..."

"Were built to attack our pack," I confirmed. "And he had a missile ready to wipe us all out."

###Chapter 0258

"We offered him mercy when we merged our pack with Grayson's," I said, my voice tight. "But he chose genocide over just eliminating the three of us."

"Alpha Damian and Dominic are dead." Sebastian's jaw clenched as he processed the information.

"That means..." Grayson trailed off.

"Vivienne is now Alpha of Silvercrest Pack," I finished for them both. "Audrey is next in line. She's currently in the cells."

"Did he mark her?" Sebastian's voice was dangerously low.

"I'm afraid so. She didn't reciprocate, but the bond was already forming." My throat tightened. "Given her current condition... I'm not sure she'll survive this."

"Take me to her." Xavier's eyes burned with desperation as he looked up at Grayson. "Let me mark her—keep her wolf alive. I never stopped loving her. Please! Let me save what's left of my family!"

Grayson looked torn. His gaze flickered between Sebastian and me before settling back on Xavier. "For Audrey's sake..." I met Grayson's eyes, and the unspoken understanding passed between us.

After a long pause, he nodded. "Alright."

Xavier was on his feet faster than I expected. Sebastian pulled me close as Grayson gripped Xavier's arm. Together, we returned to the helicopter. Sebastian and I sat on one side, Grayson and Xavier on the other. The blanket around me slipped slightly as I settled in.

"Are you okay?" Xavier's question drew my attention. His eyes widened at what he saw, making Grayson and Sebastian stiffen beside me.

"Nothing serious," I said, trying to adjust the blanket. But Grayson was faster.

"What the hell happened?" His eyes darkened to black. "Those are claw marks."

"I tore Dominic's heart out. I'm fine." I yanked the blanket back up, but Grayson wasn't having it. Neither was Sebastian, though he simply pulled me tighter against him, resting his chin atop my head.

The rest of the flight was silent. No one spoke. Xavier fidgeted in his seat. Grayson stared blankly ahead, lost in thought. Sebastian kept checking his phone, anxiety rolling off him in waves. Oddly, I wasn't worried. Oliver would pull through. He had to. There was no other option—not with a baby on the way.

The helicopter shuddered as we descended. Through the window, I saw mostly pack members milling about, with only a few guards. The tension was palpable, though no one looked terrified. What struck me most was the state of the women—dressed in rags, covered in dirt, while the men remained pristine. Cassandra's words echoed in my mind: Women are only good for one thing.

Grayson was the first out, his posture rigid as he scanned the area. Spotting a guard, he approached. "Bring Vivienne to me." I exited next, followed by Sebastian and Xavier. The helicopter's blades slowed, the noise fading into background static.

"I don't take orders from you," the guard sneered, squaring his shoulders.

"How about from me?" I stepped forward. "I ripped Dominic's heart out with my bare hands. Would you prefer I force your compliance, or will you fetch her yourself?"

The guard's eyes narrowed, his pride clearly wounded. The women nearby shrank back in fear. "Know your place!" He raised a hand, but Grayson struck first—a single punch sent the man sprawling.

"Could you please retrieve Vivienne from her cell?" I asked one of the trembling women nearby. Grayson tossed me the keys.

"Y-yes, ma'am." She bowed deeply before scurrying away.

###Chapter 0259

The sight of the woman guiding me to Vivienne made my stomach churn. Her tattered clothes barely covered her body, revealing a canvas of scars and fresh bruises. Once-vibrant brown hair now hung lifeless and brittle around her gaunt face. Dark circles shadowed her sunken eyes, and a split lip completed the heartbreaking picture.

The cells weren’t far—just a few hundred yards away. Through the dim light, I spotted Sebastian and Grayson as the woman pulled a hidden door from the earth. The stairs were steep but manageable. The stench of sweat and blood hit me like a physical force, so thick it burned my eyes. We moved through a narrow tunnel until she finally halted, unlocking a rusted door before stepping back with a bowed head.

Then I saw her.

Vivienne sat on the cold floor, a heavy metal collar clamped around her neck, its chain bolted to the wall. Dried blood and dirt matted her hair, and she wore nothing but her own filth. Yet despite it all, a faint smile curved her cracked lips.

"Vivienne?" I whispered.

"He's dead," she rasped, her voice raw but laced with quiet triumph.

"He is." I took the keys and stepped forward. "I'm getting you out of here."

"Wish I could've done it myself." Her eyes flickered open, locking onto mine with startling clarity.

"Do you understand what this means?" The collar had fused with her skin in places, forcing me to pry it free. Blood welled where metal met flesh.

"I do. But my wolf... she's barely hanging on." I shrugged off my jacket and draped it around her trembling shoulders.

"Xavier is outside," I said as I helped her stand. The realization hit me—he must have been suppressing her wolf all these years. None of her wounds had healed properly. One gash near her ribs looked dangerously infected.

"Xavier?" Her breath hitched, eyes widening.

"Yes. He's spent years trying to protect Audrey." We moved slowly, her steps unsteady as we navigated the hallway and climbed the stairs.

"Xavier..." Vivienne exhaled as fresh air touched her skin for the first time in nineteen years.

Sebastian held Xavier back as we emerged. The distance between them felt endless with Vivienne's painstaking pace. She likely hadn't walked more than a few feet at a time in that hellhole.

Then, just fifty yards from Xavier, her legs gave out.

Grayson freed Xavier from his cuffs just in time. Xavier lunged forward, catching Vivienne before she hit the ground and cradling her against his chest. "VIVIENNE!"

"Xavier... I can't believe it's you."

"Let me mark you," he begged, tears streaking his face as he cupped her cheeks. "Let me save you. If not for me, then for Audrey."

Vivienne closed her eyes but nodded. Time had run out—without his mark, she wouldn't survive.

"Do it now," I urged Xavier.

He didn't hesitate. Tugging her closer, he sank his teeth into her collarbone. Vivienne didn't scream. Didn't flinch. A single tear slipped free as he sealed the wound with his tongue. Then her head lolled to the side.

"What happened?" Xavier demanded, panic edging his voice.

"Hold onto that bond," Sebastian ordered. "We need to get her to a healer—fast."

Xavier lifted her effortlessly, his grip desperate as Grayson led the way. The woman who'd guided us earlier darted ahead. "Follow me!"

"Gather every pack member in front of the packhouse," Sebastian commanded a nearby warrior. The man hesitated but obeyed. "Women and children first," Sebastian clarified, seeing the unspoken question in his eyes.

"Take us there," I snapped. The warrior didn't acknowledge me but turned sharply and marched forward. Sebastian's fingers intertwined with mine as we followed.

Thankfully, the packhouse wasn't far. A crowd had already formed—far more women and children than I'd expected, though the lack of men didn't surprise me. Most had already been subdued.

###Chapter 0260

The air was thick with tension as Sebastian stepped forward, his voice commanding attention. "As you're all aware, Alpha Damian and Dominic are dead. But what you might not know is that Alpha Nathaniel had a daughter before his passing—Vivienne. She was Alpha Damian's mate and is currently fighting for her life in the hospital."

His gaze swept over the crowd before continuing. "Vivienne has a daughter, the rightful heir to the throne. If she doesn't survive, her child will become Alpha. Changes are coming, and they start now."

"All women and children will be escorted to Alpha Alexander's pack—the Crimson Fang Pack. Luna Audrey, a kind and nurturing soul, will ensure you're bathed, clothed, and given medical care."

Sebastian's tone hardened slightly. "The men will follow me to my territory, where you'll be dealt with accordingly." He stepped back, pulling out his phone to make arrangements.

A small girl, no older than six, tugged at my sleeve. "Is it really over? Mommy won't hurt anymore?" Her wide, hopeful eyes nearly shattered my heart.

"No, sweetheart," I murmured, crouching to her level. "She won't hurt ever again."

Sebastian returned moments later. "Vans will be here in twenty minutes."

Through the mind-link, I told him, "I'm going with them. Audrey needs to hear the truth."

"Good. You need to clean up. Are you sure you're okay?"

"I'll handle the women and children. You deal with the men."

"Warriors are on their way to assist Grayson and me."

Sebastian remained standing while the others sat, tension simmering dangerously. I worried some might try something reckless.

Just as one warrior stood, multiple vans rolled into the driveway. "Sit the hell back down," Sebastian snapped, his voice like steel. "Unless you want help staying there."

Warriors poured out of the vehicles—some still in battle gear, others in casual wear. "All women and children, board the vans," I instructed, helping a few to their feet.

A low mutter reached my ears. "Stupid bitch."

My body went rigid. Slowly, I turned and crouched in front of the offender, locking eyes with him. "Care to repeat that?"

Grayson approached in the distance, his presence a silent warning.

The warrior sneered. "I said—stupid bitch."

A cold smile curled my lips. "See this?" I held up my bloodstained hand. "This is Dominic's blood. I tore his heart out." Extending my claws, I traced a shallow line across his throat. "Disrespect me again, and I'll cut deeper. Times are changing. Adjust your attitude—or join your dead Alpha."

His defiance wavered slightly, though he didn't back down.

"Luna Evelyn," a familiar voice called.

I turned, smiling. "Wesley."

He rolled his eyes but couldn't hide his smirk. "Get moving," Sebastian ordered as the convoy started.

Through the rearview mirror, I watched Sebastian deliver a sharp blow to the warrior who'd mouthed off.

Wesley gave me a small smile as he drove. "Good to have you back."

"Glad it's finally over," I murmured, exhaling slowly.

###Chapter 0261

"Same here."

"I can finally reopen my tattoo parlor, grab a bite at that new Italian place, and get our nightclub running again!" The realization that life was returning to normal sent waves of relief through me. This was truly the end—no more looking over my shoulder, no more being cooped up in the packhouse. I could hit the gym again. Finally take that damn school exam I'd missed twice. And most importantly, talk to Sebastian about starting a family... or at least planning for one in a few years.

"We're here," Wesley announced, pulling me from my thoughts. As the van rolled up to the packhouse, I saw a crowd of women from both packs gathered outside. Audrey and Sophia stood at the front, waving like lunatics.

Before the van even stopped, Audrey dashed forward and yanked my door open. "EVELYN!" She crushed me in a bone-crushing hug.

"Can't... breathe!" I gasped, though I was laughing. She loosened her grip but didn't let go completely.

"I'm so glad you're okay!" Sophia joined us, her eyes surprisingly dry despite everything. Her baby bump was noticeably rounder now.

"I am!" I hugged her back, careful of her stomach.

"Welcome back!" Audrey beamed, slipping effortlessly into her Luna role. "These lovely ladies will help you freshen up, get you fresh clothes and a hot meal. Follow them, and if you need anything at all, just say the word!"

"Can we talk? Just the three of us?" I asked quietly.

"Of course." Audrey smiled but kept hold of Sophia's hand as we climbed the stairs.

The packhouse was unrecognizable. Only the original floors remained, now covered by an extravagant rug. New artwork adorned the walls, fresh statues flanked the doors, and everything gleamed under a fresh coat of paint. The haunted house I remembered was gone.

"Do you like it?" Audrey asked, watching my reaction.

I was speechless. Sophia squeezed my shoulders. "She wanted to erase every bad memory and replace them with good ones."

"T-thank you," I managed, blinking rapidly.

"Does this mean you'll visit more often?" Audrey asked hopefully.

"Yes," I said without hesitation. "I'd love to." Sophia smiled and linked her arm through mine as we headed to Grayson and Audrey's office.

"We prioritized the foyer. This room's next on the list," Audrey explained, settling behind the desk. Sophia took one armchair, leaving the other for me.

"Audrey..." I sat up straighter, hesitating. "Actually, Sophia—have you heard from Oliver?"

Her face lit up. "Yes! He came out of surgery right before you arrived. He's awake and stable. They're transferring him here—should arrive within the hour."

"Good."

"I can never thank you enough for saving him." Sophia grabbed my hand, her grip surprisingly strong.

"Always. I'd never leave a packmate behind."

"The surgeon said one more bullet to his abdomen would've killed him. You literally saved his life." She guided my hand to her rounded belly—definitely pregnancy, not just bloating.

After a beat, Audrey leaned forward. "What did you want to tell me?"

Taking a deep breath, I met her gaze. "I know who your parents are."

The color drained from her face. "What?"

"We've found nothing," Sophia whispered, equally stunned.

"I can skip the details if you prefer—just tell you where they are." I offered her an out.

"They never betrayed you. They've spent their lives protecting you. Good people forced into impossible choices."

The silence stretched as Audrey processed this. Finally, she squared her shoulders and nodded. "I want to know. But keep it simple—just the essentials."

###Chapter 0262

Evelyn didn’t have the same stomach as I did.

"Okay," I began, taking a deep breath. "Alpha Nathaniel was the Alpha of the Nightshade Pack. He had one daughter, Vivienne. Vivienne had a boyfriend, Xavier, who got her pregnant. She was only a few weeks along when she met Alpha Damian, her mate."

I paused, letting the weight of the words settle.

"Knowing his ruthless nature, she tried to pass off the pregnancy as his. But when the baby was born, she looked exactly like Xavier. Damian threatened to kill the child, so Vivienne and Xavier smuggled the baby out and left her near the borders of the Crimson Fang Pack."

Sophia’s eyes widened.

"Vivienne was… well, regardless, she and Damian later had Dominic. For the past nineteen years, Damian plotted to eliminate anyone who stood in the way of Dominic becoming Alpha—especially Vivienne’s firstborn. But now, both Damian and Dominic are dead. Vivienne was recently marked by Xavier and is currently hospitalized. She’s technically the Alpha of the Nightshade Pack now."

The room fell into heavy silence as both girls processed the information.

After a moment, Sophia broke the quiet. "But why were they trying to kidnap you?"

I exhaled sharply. "Their plan kept shifting, but Dominic had this… twisted fantasy about us. He hired rogues through Xavier, who deliberately chose weak ones he knew we could defeat."

Sophia’s face paled. "You almost died."

"True," I admitted. "But Xavier had to make it convincing. If he’d succeeded, his cover would’ve been blown. Shooting Sebastian in the arm was his way of making it look real without compromising his position."

Sophia frowned. "Vivienne can’t possibly lead the pack after being locked up for nineteen years."

I nodded. "Exactly. The title should go to Audrey. It’s the right thing to do. Vivienne isn’t physically or mentally capable of handling it."

Audrey’s brows furrowed. "What does that mean?"

"It means," I said carefully, "you’ll become the Alpha of the Nightshade Pack, while Grayson remains Alpha of the Crimson Fang Pack. But honestly? I’d suggest merging the two and expanding Crimson Fang’s territory."

Sophia’s eyes widened. "That’s huge."

"It is," I agreed. "And it’s something you and Grayson will need to discuss. Sebastian and I will support whatever decision you make."

Audrey hesitated before asking, "So… Vivienne and Xavier are my… parents?"

"They are," I confirmed gently. "But I’d give it a day or two before meeting them. Talk to Grayson first. I don’t want you seeing your mother in her current state."

Audrey opened her mouth, then closed it and nodded. She must’ve understood the unspoken warning—that Vivienne wasn’t in any condition for a reunion yet.

Still, I couldn’t imagine how overwhelming this must be for her. To go her whole life not knowing her parents, only to have this bombshell dropped on her.

Sophia shifted the topic. "What are Grayson and Sebastian doing?"

"Dealing with the Nightshade warriors and making adjustments. We’ll discuss how to move forward, but I think it’s best to completely dismantle that pack and rebuild. Those women have been through hell."

Audrey’s expression darkened. "Cassandra has told me a little about what happened to her. I agree—starting fresh is the only way."

I stretched, suddenly exhausted. "I need a shower, clean clothes, and then I’m raiding the kitchen."

Audrey smiled faintly. "Your room hasn’t been touched, you know."

I blinked. "What?"

"Grayson refused to let anyone change it. I cleaned it, but he insisted it stay exactly as you left it. He always believed you’d come back someday and wanted you to feel like this was still home."

My chest tightened.

"We remodeled the rest of the house," Audrey continued. "But your room is yours—whether you want to change it or leave it as is. I know this might not feel like home anymore, but I hope it’s at least a place you’ll want to visit. A place where you can make new memories—maybe with nieces or nephews someday."

I swallowed hard, emotions swirling.

Some things never changed.

And maybe… that wasn’t such a bad thing.

###Chapter 0263

I remained silent for a long moment. While I deeply respected my brother's wishes and hopes, I found myself agreeing with Audrey. This place would never truly be my home, yet I discovered a willingness to return for their future children. "Nursery," I finally said.

"What?" Audrey looked puzzled.

"Turn my old room into a nursery for your kids. You're right - I'll never consider this my home. I doubt I'll ever stay here overnight again." I took a deep breath. "But I want to see it filled with joyful memories, the kind I never had growing up. I know you'll be living at the main house, but while you're working here, make that room a nursery or playroom. I'll visit, especially when those babies start arriving. Just... use Mom's old furniture. She wanted it to be cherished, and you wanted to redecorate anyway."

Audrey's face lit up. "Then that's exactly what I'll do."

Sophia stood abruptly. "Come on, let's get you to my room so you can shower. I've got clothes you can borrow too."

"Perfect. Thanks." I smiled at Sophia but hesitated, turning back to Audrey. "Are you okay? Want to join us while I shower?"

Audrey shook her head. "I'm... processing everything. I think I need some time alone. I'll go check on the kitchen preparations." She sighed heavily before walking away.

Sophia and I headed in the opposite direction. Only when we reached her bedroom did either of us speak again. "Do you think she'll be alright?" Sophia asked quietly.

"In time," I murmured, stepping into the shower. "Finding out what happened to her parents after dreaming of reuniting with them..."

Sophia's phone buzzed. "Oliver's landing..."

"Go!" I called through the shower stream. "I remember how to wash myself, you know." She didn't need further encouragement, disappearing before I could even turn around.

Truthfully, I welcomed the solitude. The whirlwind of recent events needed processing. Since mating with Sebastian, everything had accelerated beyond comprehension - I couldn't even recall what day it was. Yet surprisingly, I felt no lingering anxiety or PTSD symptoms. Only peace. Perhaps because I'd literally torn my abuser's heart from his chest. Or maybe because I'd witnessed their deaths firsthand, knowing they could never hurt me again.

After showering, I used Sophia's hair tools and gratefully discovered new undergarments with tags still attached. Dressing in simple shorts and a tee, I finally felt like myself again. For the first time in years, I actually looked forward to socializing.

The pack house buzzed with unfamiliar energy. Children laughed while playing tag. Mothers alternated between scolding and joining their laughter. Everyone held drinks, relaxed and carefree.

"Luna Evelyn!" A familiar voice called. Suzie, one of my former pack members, approached with empty glasses. "Can I get you something? We have coffee, chai, water... lemonade for the kids. Or I can find something else if you prefer?"

"No, thank you. How's everything going? Need any help?"

"It's busy but wonderful," Suzie beamed. "Everyone's pitching in, so it's surprisingly smooth." She lowered her voice. "Though I think Luna Audrey might need assistance in the kitchen."

###Chapter 0264

"Alright. I'll go take a look," I said, flashing Audrey a reassuring smile. She nodded and continued weaving through the crowd, offering drinks to the guests. Dodging a group of energetic kids, I finally made my way to the kitchen.

"...total nightmare!" The tail end of the conversation reached my ears as I stepped inside.

"What's going on?" I asked, shutting the door behind me.

"I don't think we have enough food for everyone!" Audrey looked on the verge of tears, her hands gripping the edge of the counter.

"Okay, let's assess. What do we have?"

"We've got deli meats, some pasta dishes, salads, and fruit—but it doesn’t feel like enough." The worry in her voice was palpable.

"First, remember those women were starved. They won’t eat much at once. Second, there are boxes of mac and cheese over there—perfect for the kids." I rummaged through the fridge. "You’ve got plenty of cheese and tortillas. Some people might want quesadillas. And there’s leftover shredded chicken and steak in here. Plus, I’ll call Sebastian and check their ETA. If they’re about to leave, I’ll have him bring extra supplies from our place. Sound good?"

"Oh, thank you!" Relief washed over Audrey’s face. The kitchen staff sprang into action as I took her phone and slipped out onto the porch.

The line rang three times before he answered. "Alpha Sebastian."

"Hey, it’s me."

"Evelyn? Whose number is this?"

"Audrey’s. No clue where my phone ended up."

"A blessing in disguise, honestly."

"So, what’s going on?" His tone shifted back to business.

"How soon are you guys heading over?"

"Why? Are you okay?"

"I’m fine. More than fine, actually. But Audrey’s panicking about not having enough food."

"Ah. We were about to leave in a few. I was just getting ready to shower."

"Perfect. Can you grab all the deli meat we have and anything else that’s easy to serve?" I asked, relieved they wouldn’t be long.

"Consider it done. Any updates on Oliver?"

"Yeah. Surgery went well. They brought him here, and Sophia’s with him now. He’ll pull through."

"Good." The sound of running water filled the background.

"Hurry up," I sighed, settling onto the porch swing.

"I will, love. Promise." That word—love—always sent warmth curling through my chest.

"Bye."

"Bye." The line went dead, and I rocked gently, letting the evening breeze soothe me.

"Did you reach him?" Audrey’s voice made me jump.

"Damn it!" I clutched my chest as she plopped down beside me.

"Ha! Sorry!" She giggled, clearly amused by my reaction.

"You nearly gave me a heart attack. Yes, he’ll be here in about thirty minutes." I nudged her playfully, and she leaned into me.

"Really glad you’re okay," she murmured.

"Stubbornness pays off," I deflected, not in the mood for emotional talks.

"I should thank you, though." A small laugh escaped her.

"For what?" I frowned.

"You got us out of the school testing again. I’ve been dreading that."

I burst out laughing. "Seriously?"

"Grayson’s been stressing over that damn test and everything else."

"Why? He doesn’t even need to take it. None of us do."

The men gasped as another warrior stepped forward, then retreated.

"We accept full responsibility for failing to protect our Alpha and Lunas. Luna Amelia was found dead—her bond broken after losing her mate."

Each of them bore fresh bruises. At first, I’d assumed they were battle wounds, but now I suspected otherwise. Grayson and his warriors stood silently to the side.

"We accept any punishment you deem fit. Your bravery didn’t just end Dominic and Damian—it saved countless lives." A third warrior spoke before falling back into line. The silence was absolute—even the children stayed quiet.

Sebastian’s gaze lifted to mine. "I can handle their punishment if you’d prefer," he mind-linked.

Taking a deep breath, I descended the steps and into his arms.

"Everyone will be punished," I began. A few flinched, bracing themselves. After a pause, I continued, "But not tonight. Tonight, we celebrate our victory. We mourn the lost and honor the new lives we’ve saved. Tomorrow, we rebuild. Changes are coming. Actions speak louder than words—and we are watching."

"Dismissed," Sebastian commanded before turning to me. "I’m sorry I wasn’t there to get you."

"I got myself out." Gripping his shirt, I tugged him down. He obliged, his lips brushing mine gently, careful of my split lip.

"You’re the strongest person I know," he murmured.

"I’m sorry about your mother," I whispered.

"I felt the bond snap when we were on our way to you." His eyes closed briefly.

"How did you find me?"

"Harrison broke through the firewall right after you were taken. Two locations popped up. We split into teams—time wasn’t on our side."

Wrapping my arms around his neck, I melted into his embrace. "I don’t regret my choice."

"I know you don’t." He scowled, but affection softened it. "You’re equal parts infuriating and brave."

###Chapter 0265

"He wants to frame his diploma on the wall. To inspire the kids about the value of education. Grayson plans to enroll in business classes this fall." Audrey murmured it like a well-kept secret.

"Oh?" That caught me off guard.

"Yep. Says he wants to set a good example."

"That’s… actually impressive." I hadn’t expected that from him. Personally, I had zero interest in further schooling. Part of me had considered it, but right now, all I wanted was to return to my shop and unwind. We lapsed into comfortable silence until I finally stood.

As if summoned by fate, the rumble of engines echoed down the driveway. My pulse leapt with excitement. Women burst from the packhouse, sprinting toward their returning mates with shrieks of joy, throwing themselves into waiting arms. Some of the men looked freshly showered, while others were still coated in grime.

"MEN!" Sebastian’s voice cracked through the air like a whip, sharp and furious. Every warrior immediately released their mates and snapped into formation. The women stumbled back, bewildered. Even I blinked in confusion, moving to the top of the porch steps for a better view. Sebastian strode forward, arms crossed, his expression thunderous.

One soldier stepped forward, standing at rigid attention. "Luna Evelyn," he began, voice clipped and formal. "Due to our negligence, we were captured. Because of our failure, Alpha Benjamin and Theodore lost their lives. And because of that, you were forced to surrender yourself—again—to spare us from the same fate."

The weight of his words settled over the crowd. Many of the women gasped, hands flying to their mouths. My stomach twisted.

Sebastian’s jaw clenched. "You all know the consequences of failure. You know the stakes." His gaze swept over them, cold and unyielding. "This isn’t just about discipline. It’s about survival."

A heavy silence followed. No one dared move.

Then, from the back, a voice spoke up—soft but steady. "We won’t fail again."

Sebastian’s eyes narrowed. "Prove it."

The tension was suffocating.

And then—

A sharp cry split the air.

Every head turned.

A figure staggered into view, blood streaking their face.

"They’re coming."

Chaos erupted in every direction. Furniture, clothes, blankets—anything salvageable—was being hauled out and tossed into piles. A can of gasoline sat ominously near a torch, and I knew exactly what they intended to do. I wasn’t opposed. What caught me off guard was Oliver perched on the front steps, looking far too smug for someone who should still be in a hospital bed.

"What are you doing?" I called out as I stepped out of the car. Even Sebastian seemed baffled.

"Fresh air," Oliver declared, as if that explained everything. Sophia planted a firm hand on his shoulder, keeping him seated.

"Don’t even think about standing," she scolded. "You should be resting."

"My wolf’s healing me just fine," he argued, though he winced as he shifted. "I’m just supervising."

"If you don’t stop moving, I’m dragging you back to the hospital myself," Sophia snapped. Nearby women muffled their laughter behind their hands.

Sebastian and I exchanged a glance before heading inside.

The house was eerily spotless, yet it felt like something out of a nightmare. The stained-glass windows depicting wolves were hauntingly beautiful—twisted artistry that sent a chill down my spine. Part of me wanted to preserve them, if only to repurpose them somewhere meaningful, like a shelter. A final insult to the monster who once ruled here.

"You zoning out?" Sebastian nudged me.

"Those windows," I murmured. "They’re… something."

"Not the worst idea you’ve had," he admitted, lacing his fingers through mine and pulling me down the hall.

The office door was ajar, and Audrey’s voice carried through, sharp with frustration.

"—absolute pigsty! And this man had the nerve to demand cleanliness from others?"

"Sounds like things are going smoothly," I remarked, stepping inside with a smirk.

Audrey whirled around, her hair wild, eyes blazing. "This is all your fault!"

"The great Audrey, overwhelmed by paperwork?" I teased.

She planted her hands on her hips, a fire in her gaze I’d never seen before. "You handed me an organized mess. This is—" She gestured wildly at the chaos.

"How about I take over here?" I offered. "I heard the kitchen crew needs help deciding what to keep."

"You know what?" She exhaled sharply. "Fine. I’ll handle that." With a dramatic huff, she stormed out.

Grayson looked exhausted just from listening to her. "She’s… adjusting."

"We need your help," he admitted.

"Got it." I nudged his chair aside. "Go figure out housing arrangements. Send Sophia in when she’s done yelling at Oliver."

"All the women are yelling today," Grayson muttered.

"I haven’t yelled yet," I pointed out.

"Yet being the key word," Sebastian murmured under his breath.

I slowly lifted my gaze, locking onto Grayson, who immediately bolted from the room. Sebastian smirked but leaned down to press a quick kiss to my lips.

"Get out of here," I grumbled half-heartedly, already sifting through the files.

The evidence was all there—every attack, every plan to dismantle our packs, every piece of land he’d intended to claim. Businesses he’d owned, most of which would now default to the banks. If only we’d had this information sooner.

###Chapter 0266
"It truly is a blessing," I chuckled, leaning into Sebastian's warmth.

"Sebastian? Evelyn? The feast won't start without you two!" Audrey's voice carried from the packhouse doorway, her crimson curls bouncing as she waved us over.

"Coming!" I called back as Sebastian released me, his fingers intertwining with mine as we walked. The grand hall was alive with chatter, long tables draped in ivory linens, and a lavish buffet spread along the far wall. Sebastian remained standing as we took our seats.

"Brief announcements before we begin," his alpha voice commanded attention. "First—my pack members may return to your homes tonight. Our Nightshade allies will remain as guests, and relocation plans will be shared tomorrow after sensitive matters are resolved." His gaze swept the room. "To Crimson Fang Pack—your generosity these past days won't be forgotten."

Thunderous applause erupted. Audrey flushed pink while Grayson gave a casual salute, though his grin betrayed his pride.

As Sebastian sat, Audrey sprang up. "Tables are called by number for serving—lowest digits first!"

Being Table One, our group filed toward the steaming dishes. Halfway through, Table Two followed. The orderly procession hummed with quiet conversations, a far cry from the tension of recent weeks. Though my friends chattered around me, I found myself studying each face—parents gone, their safety now resting squarely on our shoulders.

"Scarlett?" Nathan's nudge jolted me from my thoughts.

"Hmm?" I blinked at the circle of expectant faces—Audrey, Grayson, Sophia, Nathan, Cassandra, and Sebastian all watching me.

"Where'd you drift off to?" Grayson prodded.

"The danger's passed," I murmured, more to myself than them. "My parlor can reopen. Moonhowl Club can welcome patrons again. People will stroll through markets without fear." My voice strengthened. "The mantle's ours now. We're safe. All of us."

Sebastian's arm encircled my waist, pulling me flush against his side. His lips brushed my temple as he adjusted our chairs together. "Damn right," he rumbled.

"Your shop's fully stocked!" Audrey clapped her hands. "We should throw a reopening gala! Let me plan it—" Her emerald eyes sparkled with mischief no one could refuse.

"Fine," I laughed. "But keep the live peacocks out of it this time."

"Me? Go overboard?" She pressed a hand to her chest in mock offense as Grayson rolled his eyes affectionately.

"Florida trip still happening?" Nathan asked around a mouthful of roast beef.

"Next week, maybe," Sebastian said. "After we finalize territory assignments. Though that headache's yours, Grayson."

"Actually..." Grayson leaned back, exchanging a glance with Audrey. "It concerns you both." He slid a parchment across the table—a freshly inked map dividing our lands into two equal halves instead of three packs, with the township at its heart. One side labeled for Grayson and Audrey, the other for Sebastian and me.

My fork clattered onto my plate. "You're dissolving Nightshade?"

"The territory's too vast for one alpha pair," Grayson said evenly. "After recent events... it's time to retire the old divisions."

Audrey reached for my hand. "You spearheaded Damian and Dominic's downfall. Without you—"

"I did what any luna would," I cut in automatically. "Funny how clarity finds you when your mate's at gunpoint and warriors bleed at your feet."

The words hung heavy in the sudden silence, until Sebastian's growl vibrated against my shoulder. "Never again." His promise seared into my skin, a vow etched deeper than any tattoo.

###Chapter 0267

"Nevertheless, this is our proposal." Grayson's voice was steady as he lifted his glass and took a sip. "Each member will have the choice—whether they wish to serve under me or Sebastian. We'll establish our own territories accordingly."

I blinked, stunned into silence. "Are you certain?" Sebastian leaned forward, plucking the document from the table to scrutinize it further.

"Absolutely." Grayson's response was simple. "Come by tomorrow, and we'll finalize everything." He rose to his feet, and Audrey followed suit.

"It's early, but we're retiring for the evening," Audrey announced, her fingers lacing with Grayson's. "A quiet night in our rooms sounds perfect."

"I should get back to Oliver anyway," Sophia said, standing.

"Let me know if you need anything," I told her.

"Of course!" We watched as Sophia slipped out of the kitchen and disappeared through the door.

Grayson cleared his throat, commanding attention. "Everyone, Luna Audrey and I will be retiring for the night. Quiet hours will be observed as usual. Rooms have been assigned—if there are any issues, staff are available to assist. They can mind-link us if necessary. We're always here to help. For those returning to Silvercrest Pack, a shuttle will be provided."

Nods rippled through the room before conversations resumed.

"I'd like to go home too," I murmured to Sebastian.

"Here." Grayson tossed Sebastian a set of keys. "Take my car. Bring it back tomorrow."

Sebastian caught them effortlessly. "You can stay."

"No," I said firmly. "I want my own bed. Maybe another night, but not tonight."

Nathan frowned but didn't argue.

"Thank you." Cassandra's voice was quiet, breaking her hours-long silence.

I turned to her, puzzled. "For what?"

"For killing them." Her expression remained blank, but Nathan wrapped an arm around her as she buried her face against his chest. His look told us this was her way of coping.

"I hope you find peace," I said softly before Sebastian and I followed Grayson and Audrey out.

Several pack members stopped us to express gratitude, but I was eager to leave.

The drive was silent. Sebastian unlocked the car, opened my door, and slid into the driver's seat. As soon as we pulled out of the driveway, his hand settled on my thigh. Without thinking, I curled my legs up, hugging them to my chest, and held onto his arm. I rested my head against the seat and closed my eyes.

"Love, we're home." Sebastian's voice roused me, his hand gently shaking my shoulder. It felt like we'd just left.

"Okay." I released his arm and stepped out. I expected him to take my hand as we walked inside, but instead, he swept me off my feet, his hands gripping my thighs. Startled, my arms flew around his neck, my ankles locking behind him.

"Much better," he grumbled, carrying me inside.

His mouth found my neck, his tongue tracing the sensitive skin before his teeth nipped lightly. I was so lost in the sensation that I barely registered when we reached our room—until the door slammed shut behind us, the lock clicking into place.

No one else was here, but the habit remained.

"Forgive me," Sebastian murmured, his voice rough. "This won't be gentle. I'll make it up to you later."

He tossed me onto the bed, looming over me, his gaze burning.

"Good." I sat up, fingers tugging at the drawstring of his shorts, letting them fall.

###Chapter 0268

To say I was aching would be putting it mildly. Sebastian had certainly kept his promise about not going easy on me. Not that I was complaining. The physical reconnection was exactly what I needed. He was mine, and I was his. The only man I would ever allow to touch me.

We had just finished getting dressed and were about to leave. There was so much to discuss, yet so little at the same time. After Grayson dropped that bombshell on us, the possibilities were endless. We needed to search the Nightshade Packhouse and remove any sensitive information.

Grayson wanted to meet us there and let all the women retrieve whatever belongings they wanted from their homes. They could choose to stay or leave permanently. We would respect their decision either way. If they had a mate, they were required to live in the packhouse—or at least until they could prove they knew how to treat a mate properly. Ultimately, it was the woman’s choice whether to stay or reject them. Everyone would undergo therapy to ensure no one was being forced. I had a feeling most, if not all, of the women would request new housing.

Additionally, all pack members—men and women—would be allowed to choose which pack they wanted to join, or even request to transfer to another. Some packs across the U.S. had reputations just as bad as Alpha Damian’s. Part of me feared they might leave and seek those packs out, taking their mates and children with them. But in the end, I knew I couldn’t interfere—it was up to the women to decide.

Everyone had already been informed of their options. By the time we arrived at the Nightshade Pack, we’d have a clearer idea of who was staying and who was leaving—or at least by the end of the day.

“What did you do with the warriors?” I asked as we walked toward the car.

“They each fought me and ran through some drills,” Sebastian sighed.

“And the Nightshade warriors?”

“They were whipped and will be brought out in cuffs. They can either plead their case or face execution. Their choice.” He didn’t seem bothered by it.

“Where are they now?” I asked through the mind-link as we pulled out of the garage and headed to meet Grayson.

“Our warriors collected them this morning and marched them over. They’re already at the pack, chained to posts.”

“This is going to be a long day,” I sighed. “I hate this part of the job.”

“Me too, love. Me too.”

“So, you’re sticking with that pet name for me?”

“Feels like a lifetime ago since we had that conversation,” Sebastian chuckled.

“I know. I’m hoping I can convince Grayson to open the club tonight.”

“I think he’d be on board with that.” I sensed a flicker of excitement from him.

“Is the event center construction finished?” I asked.

“Actually, yes. It was completed last week. I’ve already secured it for a housing division.”

“When did you do that?” I asked, completely caught off guard.

“The other day. I got an email from them, and we needed more housing anyway, so it worked out.”

“It’s nice when things just fall into place,” I said as we slowed down. “I don’t think I’ve ever been here before.”

The border was entirely brick, standing at least eight feet tall. Wrought iron gates stood open for us, with sleek, high-tech cameras perched on each corner. The trees were dense all the way until we reached a clearing.

Everything was dark—oppressively so. The packhouse was a grim shade of charcoal, topped with a black roof. There wasn’t a single plant or patch of greenery in sight—just concrete and metal. My heart shattered for the children who had to grow up in this place.

###Chapter 0269

The estate buzzed with activity as people moved in every direction. Furniture, clothes, blankets—anything salvageable—was being hauled out and piled haphazardly. Near the edge of the chaos, I spotted a gas can and a torch, and I immediately understood their plan. Honestly, I wasn’t opposed.

What did surprise me was Oliver perched on the front steps, looking far too smug for someone who should still be in a hospital bed.

"What are you doing?" I called as I climbed out of my car. Beside me, Sebastian looked just as confused.

"Fresh air," Oliver said, grinning. "A man can only take so much sterile hospital smell."

Sophia planted a firm hand on his shoulder, keeping him seated. "Don’t even think about standing. You’re supposed to be resting."

"I’ve got my wolf. I’m healing just fine," he argued, though the wince that followed his laugh betrayed him.

"If you don’t sit still, I will drag you back to the hospital myself," Sophia scolded. A few passing women muffled their laughter, and Oliver rolled his eyes.

Sebastian and I left them to it, heading up the steps into the house.

The place was eerily spotless, yet it felt like something out of a nightmare. The stained glass windows depicting wolves were disturbingly beautiful—macabre artistry. Part of me wanted to preserve them, if only to repurpose them somewhere they could be appreciated. A women’s shelter, maybe. A final middle finger to the horrors this house represented.

"You okay?" Sebastian asked, noticing I’d stopped walking.

"Those windows," I murmured. "They’re grotesque, but there’s something about them."

"Not the worst idea you’ve had," he admitted, lacing his fingers through mine and tugging me down the hall.

The office door stood open, and inside, Audrey was ranting to Grayson.

"—a complete disaster! For someone who demanded perfection, he was an absolute slob!"

"Sounds like things are going smoothly," I said, unable to hide my smirk as we entered.

Audrey whirled on me, her hair sticking out in wild directions. "This is all your fault!"

I arched a brow. "The great Audrey, overwhelmed by a little paperwork?"

She planted her hands on her hips, glaring—something she never did. "You handed me an organized mess. This is just—" She flailed her arms, looking borderline hysterical.

"How about I take over here?" I offered. "I think I heard the kitchen crew arguing about what food to keep."

Audrey exhaled sharply. "You know what? Fine. I’ll go deal with that." She stormed out, leaving Grayson looking exhausted.

"She’s… adjusting," he muttered.

"We need your help, though," Sebastian added.

"I’ve got it." I nudged Grayson’s chair aside. "Go figure out housing arrangements for the warriors. And send Sophia in when she’s done yelling at Oliver."

Grayson sighed. "All the women are yelling today."

"I haven’t yelled yet," I pointed out, feigning offense.

"Yet being the key word," Sebastian muttered.

I slowly lifted my gaze, fixing him with a look. Grayson bolted from the room, laughing, while Sebastian just smirked before leaning down to kiss me.

"Get out of here," I grumbled halfheartedly, already flipping through the first stack of files.

And there it was—everything. The paper trail of his attacks on our packs. His plans to raze our lands. His business holdings—most of which would default to the banks now.

If only we’d had this information sooner.

###Chapter 0270

The golden hues of sunset painted the sky as I worked diligently, transferring files to the flash drive. Through the open window, muffled voices reached my ears—conversations that piqued my curiosity but were laced with a tension I didn’t dare investigate. Sebastian’s simmering anger was enough of a warning.

Sophia had brought over a few boxes, meticulously organizing paperwork while I finished wiping the computer clean. The room was quiet except for the rustling of papers and the occasional hum of the dying computer fan.

The door creaked open, and Sebastian strode in with Grayson close behind. "How’s it going?" Sebastian asked, his gaze flickering between us.

"Almost done," Sophia answered, stretching her back with a tired sigh. "Mind carrying these to the car?"

Without hesitation, they each grabbed a box and disappeared back into the hallway.

I turned to Sophia. "How’s the little one?"

"Growing too fast," she murmured, rubbing her rounded belly. "Like a weed."

"Any idea if it’s a boy or girl?" I powered off the computer.

"We’re keeping it a surprise," she said with a soft smile.

"Where’s Oliver?"

"Probably doing something reckless that’ll land him in the ER," she grumbled.

As if summoned by the mention of hospitals, Audrey stepped into the room, her expression determined.

I already knew what she was going to say.

"I want to meet them."

Right on cue, Sebastian and Grayson returned. "Meet who?" Sebastian asked, settling beside Sophia.

"Vivienne and Xavier."

Grayson’s eyes darted to me. "Audrey, they’re in rough shape," I started carefully.

"I know," she cut in, "but we need them to renounce their claim so we can move forward. And… I just need to see them."

"Sweetheart, you understand they didn’t leave you by choice?" Grayson wasn’t refusing, but his hesitation mirrored mine.

"We talked about this last night," she snapped, glaring at him.

"Audrey—" I tried again.

"If you were in my place, would you let anyone stop you?" she challenged, her voice sharp.

I exhaled. "Fine. But you need to understand what Vivienne went through—what they both endured. Everything they did for nineteen years was to keep you safe and loved. Remember that." I shot Grayson a look that said, She’s your responsibility now.

"Let’s go," Grayson sighed.

I wanted to follow—Vivienne would recognize me, at least.

"Are you okay?" I asked Audrey as we walked. "You seem… tense."

"I can’t focus knowing they’re here," she admitted. "It’s all I can think about. If meeting them is what it takes to clear my head, then I’m doing it."

It made sense, but I worried how she’d handle it. Audrey had always been gentle-hearted. Seeing the parents she never knew, broken and scarred, might shatter her.

The hospital loomed ahead, its once-pristine walls now dull and cracked. Dead vines clung to the side like skeletal fingers. A single guard stood at the entrance, his posture rigid.

"Alpha. Luna," he greeted as we passed, holding the door open before sealing it shut behind us.

The hallway was dim, lit only by emergency lights. Shadows stretched long, and the air smelled sterile yet stale. My imagination conjured images of masked figures lurking in doorways—too many horror movies, perhaps.

Lost in thought, I nearly collided with Sebastian when he stopped abruptly. "Sorry," I muttered, stepping back.

"Audrey," I said gently, "let me go in first. I’ll prepare them, okay?"

###Chapter 0271

"O-okay." Vivienne's voice trembled slightly as hesitation flickered across her face.

Grayson immediately wrapped his arms around Audrey, who buried her face in his chest. He gave me a meaningful nod as I pushed the hospital door open. Sebastian slipped in beside me like a shadow, closing the door swiftly before taking up a protective stance against the wall, arms crossed like some brooding sentinel.

The sight of Vivienne made my breath catch. Bandages covered nearly every visible inch of her. Her neck was completely swathed in white gauze, and yellowing bruises peeked through the dressings on her face. The hospital blankets were drawn up to her chest, hiding whatever other injuries lay beneath. An IV line snaked from her hand to a hanging bag of fluids.

Xavier looked remarkably better. His dark hair was clean and tied back in a neat bun, his beard freshly trimmed. Though bruises still marred his face, he appeared almost healthy compared to when we'd first found them. He sat vigil beside Vivienne's bed, holding her hand with surprising gentleness. Both pairs of eyes snapped to me as I entered.

"How are you feeling today?" I asked, keeping my voice soft.

Vivienne's response came out weak but determined. "The healers gave me something to restore my wolf connection. I'm still... fragile. My wolf is struggling to manifest." She attempted a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. "We owe you our lives."

"You understand the situation with the Alpha title, correct? Since Damian was killed, it automatically transferred to you."

Vivienne's expression remained carefully blank. "I've realized that. I assume you want us to relinquish it."

"It's not about what I want," I said gently. "Neither of you are in any condition to lead a pack right now, let alone make life-altering decisions for others. After nineteen years of imprisonment and abuse, the world outside those cells will feel foreign to you. You both need time to heal - physically and mentally."

To my surprise, Vivienne let out a raspy chuckle. "Child, we're not arguing. We don't want the title, but neither do we want to hand it over to just anyone."

"Actually," I said, watching their reactions carefully, "Audrey is here."

Their heads jerked up in perfect unison. "What?"

"Your daughter wants to meet you. I believe transferring the Alpha title to her would be the wisest course of action. She's waiting just outside."

Vivienne's fingers tightened around Xavier's. "She... wants to meet us?" The fear in her voice was palpable.

"She does. Audrey has no expectations, no demands. She's well cared for and wants for nothing. She simply wishes to know her parents." I paused, choosing my words carefully. "I've told her the basics of your story. She understands she wasn't abandoned out of lack of love, but to protect her. Audrey doesn't need parents - she wants the chance to build a relationship with you, if you're willing."

Vivienne exchanged a long look with Xavier before turning back to me. "Please... bring her in."

I nodded to Sebastian, who moved to open the door. A visibly trembling Audrey entered with Grayson at her side. The moment Vivienne and Xavier saw her, twin gasps filled the room.

"This is Audrey and her mate Grayson. Grayson is my twin and Alpha of Crimson Fang Pack." I gestured to Sebastian. "And this is Sebastian, Alpha of Silvercrest Pack - my mate."

Vivienne's eyes welled with tears. "She looks exactly like you," she whispered.

"Audrey, these are Vivienne and Xavier," I completed the introductions.

"You're even more beautiful than I imagined," Vivienne said, struggling to sit up straighter. Xavier quickly adjusted the bed controls, wincing as Vivienne suppressed a pained gasp.

"Are you in pain? Should I call a healer?" Audrey asked, hovering uncertainly near the foot of the bed.

Vivienne shook her head. "No, darling. Please, come closer." Audrey took a tentative step forward but remained just out of reach, with Grayson hovering protectively behind her.

Xavier cleared his throat. "Could you... would you tell us about your childhood?"

Audrey twisted her fingers together. "Oh, um... It was good, I suppose. The orphanage made sure we never went without. I had plenty of clothes, friends..." She shrugged. "Got into some trouble as a teenager. School bored me until Evelyn found me. She became my mentor, pushed me academically. Honestly, she changed my entire life."
###Chapter 0272

"Audrey is brilliant, and all she needed was someone to see it. She did all the hard work herself," I added. Sebastian stepped up behind me, his warm hands resting on my shoulders. His pride in me was palpable.

"Are you planning to attend college?" Xavier asked.

"I haven't decided yet," Audrey admitted. "Before Grayson and I became mates, I was set on it. But now, with the responsibilities of being a Luna, I might not. Grayson suggested online courses, but I'm not sure that's what I want anymore. I want to help kids—those who just need someone to believe in them, like Evelyn did for me. That’s what I want my Luna legacy to be."

Vivienne's eyes shimmered with unshed tears. "I know my words might not mean much, but I want you to know how proud we are of you. I'm sorry I wasn't strong enough to be there for you, but you've grown into an incredible woman. Every night, I prayed to the Moon Goddess for your safety and happiness."

Audrey straightened her posture, her voice steady. "I want you to transfer the Alpha title to me, but I’d also like you both to move into the packhouse as guests. Grayson has agreed to build you a home—you can design it however you like. We’ll cover all expenses until you establish an income. Xavier, if you wish, you can join the warriors on probation. Aside from a few rules, you’ll have freedom to come and go. This way, we can get to know each other."

"Of course," Vivienne said softly. "We’ll give you the title. We just want the chance to know you—and any future grandchildren. I may not have been the mother you deserved, but I hope you’ll let me be a grandmother."

Xavier stood and approached Grayson, who subtly shifted to shield Audrey. The protective gesture didn’t escape Xavier’s notice.

"I won’t lie—I’m not warrior material," Xavier admitted. "After years on my own, I’ve got authority issues and skills that don’t exactly fit pack life." He glanced at Audrey. "But I want to try. To be better. I’ll join the warriors, but understand—it’ll be a process. I might mouth off, and I make no promises. But if it means having a relationship with my daughter, I’ll do it." He extended his hand to Grayson.

Grayson studied him for a beat before clasping it. "I won’t go easy on you. I’ll push you, and I won’t tolerate disrespect. But I respect what you did to protect Audrey. That’s the only reason I’m allowing this."

Xavier nodded, then turned to us. "Evelyn, thank you for everything you’ve done for my—for Audrey." His gaze flicked to Sebastian. "And I’m sorry for shooting you. I wasn’t aiming to kill—just to make it convincing. I regret that an innocent man died because of it."

Sebastian’s jaw tightened, but I spoke before the tension could thicken. "We’ll settle that on the training field another day."

Xavier dipped his chin in understanding.

"Shall we transfer the titles now?" Vivienne asked.

###Chapter 0273

"Let's proceed." Audrey nodded firmly.

Her voice trembled slightly as she spoke the ancient words. "I, Vivienne Blackwood, Daughter of Alpha Nathaniel and former Alpha of Nightshade Pack, hereby relinquish my title as Alpha. I pass this legacy to my only living daughter, Audrey Blackwood." A visible shudder ran through Vivienne's body as the power left her.

The response came without hesitation. "I, Audrey Jeffrey, Luna of Crimson Fang Pack, accept the title of Alpha of Nightshade Pack."

The room fell into heavy silence until Xavier's sudden laughter broke through. "What's so amusing?" Evelyn asked, watching as both Audrey and Vivienne struggled to catch their breath.

Xavier wiped tears from his eyes. "The irony is priceless. Theodore wanted Dominic to inherit everything. Now look—Audrey's an Alpha, mated to another Alpha. Together, they'll be the most formidable pair in our world. In trying to prevent this, he created exactly what he feared most."

Vivienne frowned. "But if they merge packs, won't Audrey lose her Alpha status? Wouldn't it transfer to Grayson?"

Sebastian's arms tightened around Evelyn as she answered. "Not necessarily. Since she's a born Alpha female, the power might remain with her regardless."

Audrey's voice cut through the speculation. "We're combining the packs and retiring the Nightshade name. Too much blood stains its history." Her gaze locked with Vivienne's. "Though if you'd kept me... I suspect my childhood would've been very different. Perhaps worse. In the end, you gave me the chance at happiness."

Evelyn felt pride swell in her chest. That level of understanding and forgiveness was rare—especially given the circumstances. This maturity would serve Audrey well in her healing journey.

Grayson leaned forward. "When can you leave the hospital?"

Xavier answered for her. "The doctors say later this week. Her neck injury still needs time."

"We'll prepare rooms for you both," Audrey said decisively. "Once you're stronger, we can discuss more permanent arrangements."

Vivienne's smile was tentative but hopeful. "Thank you. We'll respect whatever boundaries you set, but... I'd love to learn about your life. Your favorite foods, colors... anything you'd share."

Audrey's compromise came swiftly. "I'll arrange your transfer to Crimson Fang's medical center tomorrow. I'll personally ensure you're comfortable."

Vivienne's fingers absently traced the hospital sheets. "A real bed will be nice." The moment the words left her lips, she froze, realizing their implication. Her eyes darted between their expressions. "Oh gods, I didn't mean—"

"You didn't offend anyone," Evelyn interjected smoothly, seeing Audrey's panic.

Sebastian took the cue. "Vivienne, we should return to pack business. The main house demolition begins tonight, with other structures tomorrow. Thank you for meeting with us."

Vivienne's gratitude shone through her tears. "No, thank you for bringing Audrey to us. Peaceful coexistence is more than we dared hope for." Her gaze lingered on Xavier. "My love for you never faded."

###Chapter 0274

The crisp evening air brushed against my skin as we stepped out of the hospital. Strands of my hair danced across my face, carried by the gentle breeze.

"How are you feeling?" I asked Audrey, studying her expression carefully.

She exhaled slowly, her fingers twisting together. "I don't know. Like you said, I don’t need their approval... but part of me still wants it. It’s strange. All my life, I wondered if they’d be proud of me."

I reached out, squeezing her hand. "They were proud of you. More than anything, they were relieved you had a good childhood. Vivienne couldn’t have given you that. If she’d kept you..." I hesitated, then pushed forward. "You could’ve been hurt. Or worse."

Audrey swallowed hard. "Logically, I know you're right. But it’s still hard to process. Maybe understanding what they saved me from makes it easier to accept why they did it. Vivienne looked so... broken."

Her emotions were a storm—confusion, grief, longing—all swirling beneath the surface.

"Like you said, maybe with time, you can build something with her," I offered. "This is all new for Vivienne too. Maybe she’ll pick up hobbies you can share. If you want to, of course. This is all on your terms. You don’t owe anyone anything."

Audrey nodded but stayed silent.

As we approached the packhouse, the sight of everyone gathered outside greeted us. Sophia stood on the porch steps, clipboard in hand, directing people with effortless authority.

"Good, you're back," she said, spotting us. "Here’s the list for both of you. It details which members are transferring to which pack, along with housing preferences and special requests. Everyone’s already packed their belongings into their vehicles."

Sebastian took our list, scanning it quickly. Glancing at Grayson’s, he noted the numbers were roughly even. Sophia had organized everything flawlessly—names, ages, dietary needs, even the smallest details accounted for.

"I wasn’t sure about Cassandra, so I assigned rooms at the packhouse for your group," Sophia told Audrey and Grayson. "You can rearrange them later, but at least it’s one less thing to worry about now."

"Thank you," Grayson said when Audrey didn’t respond.

I noticed her hands trembling. After everything she’d been through, the weight of it all was finally crashing down.

"Is everything ready to go?" I asked quickly, shifting focus to give Audrey a moment.

Sophia nodded. "Yes. I did a final walkthrough. The office is cleared out, boxes are loaded, the kitchen’s emptied—everyone has their things. We’re ready when you are." Her gaze flicked to Oliver, who gave her a subtle nod. "Yep, we’re good!"

"Perfect," I said.

Grayson stepped forward, addressing the crowd. "Thank you all for moving so efficiently. For those who don’t know me, I’m Alpha Grayson of the Crimson Fang Pack. This is my mate, Alpha Audrey of the Nightshade Pack—the rightful heir to the title. Alpha Sebastian leads the Silvercrest Pack, and his mate, Luna Evelyn, is my twin sister." He gestured to Oliver. "You’ve met Beta Oliver of the Silvercrest Pack and his mate, Beta Sophia. My Beta, Nathan, isn’t here, but you may remember his mate, Beta Cassandra. We’re all here to help however you need."

He paused, scanning the faces before him. "Beta Sophia has provided lists of who’s transferring where. The Nightshade Pack will merge with ours, and the territory will be divided. The Nightshade name will be retired completely."

The crowd murmured, but no one protested.

This was the moment everything had led to—freeing these women and children. Looking back, I’d been naive to think Dominic’s obsession with me was the only motive. The bigger picture had always been about this.

###Chapter 0275

"Alright everyone, let's begin the demolition with the packhouse first. Step back unless you want to get toasted." Grayson's voice carried a dark humor that sent shivers down my spine.

We retreated down the porch steps, creating a wide perimeter. Grayson disappeared inside with the gasoline can, emerging moments later with an empty container. He poured a trail of fuel along the wooden planks, creating a fiery path that led right to our feet. Audrey handed him the matchbox with trembling fingers.

Just as he was about to strike the match, his gaze locked onto mine. "The honor should be yours, Evelyn."

My fingers closed around the matchbox. The moment the match head scraped against the striker, a surge of adrenaline coursed through my veins. The tiny flame flickered to life, mirroring the fire burning in my chest. All the pain, the manipulation, the fear - I was setting it all free.

Kneeling, I whispered words meant only for the universe to hear: "With this flame, I release every ounce of darkness. No more anger. No more hurt. Only healing remains."

The gasoline ignited with a violent whoosh. I barely had time to jump back before the fire raced toward the house. The explosion sent a shockwave through the air, Sebastian's strong arms the only thing preventing me from being knocked off my feet.

An eerie silence fell over our group as we watched the structure collapse in on itself. The cracking of timbers and shattering of glass created a macabre symphony. Flames licked at the night sky, casting dancing shadows across our solemn faces.

Hours passed before only the chimney remained standing, a lone sentinel amidst the smoldering ruins. The full moon hung heavy above us, its pale light illuminating the destruction.

"Transport vans are available for those who need them," Grayson announced. "Otherwise, follow your designated Alpha back to their territories. Rooms have been prepared for everyone."

Sebastian stepped forward. "Silvercrest Pack members - we'll convene at 9 AM sharp in the conference hall. Look for the marked signs." Nods of acknowledgment rippled through the crowd.

We lingered by our vehicle, ensuring every displaced pack member found transportation. To my relief, no one needed the vans - each had arranged their own way home. Only when the last car door closed did we finally climb into ours, leading the procession away from the ruins.

Our paths diverged at the fork in the road, Grayson's convoy heading west while we turned east. The headlights behind us formed a serpentine chain through the darkness. When we finally arrived at Silvercrest, nearly our entire pack stood waiting in the courtyard, ready to welcome our new members.

My heart swelled watching our warriors help unload belongings while Sophia directed traffic at the entrance. Sebastian and I hovered on the sidelines, observing the seamless integration. Teenagers distributed water bottles and energy bars while strong arms carried luggage to assigned quarters.

An hour later, with everyone settled, the packhouse quieted. Through a window, I spotted several women posting directional signs for tomorrow's meeting. Sebastian had already mind-linked the entire pack about the mandatory assembly.

"Do you think Xavier and Vivienne will adjust well?" I asked as we prepared for bed.

Sebastian's lips quirked. "Vivienne will thrive. Xavier... might need some time to find his footing."

###Chapter 0276

The silk sheets felt cool against my bare skin as I slipped beneath them. Sebastian had his back turned, preoccupied with emptying his pockets. A mischievous idea sparked in my mind - I pulled the covers up to my chin, concealing my nakedness completely.

"Grayson's handling the situation, so that's one less thing to worry about." Sebastian stripped down to his boxers, his muscles flexing with each movement.

"Thank the Moon Goddess for that." His deep sigh filled the room as he joined me under the covers. His warm palm immediately found my hip, pulling me closer. "No nightgown tonight, little wolf?"

I pressed my body flush against his, relishing the heat radiating from him. His hand slid lower, gripping my backside possessively. "Didn't see the point when you always end up tearing them off anyway."

A primal growl rumbled through his chest as he flipped me onto my back. In one fluid motion, he pinned me beneath him, capturing my lips in a searing kiss. "Not too tender from last time?" His whisper sent shivers down my spine.

"Make me forget all about it." My claws raked down his back as he began trailing kisses down my body.

"Is that an invitation?" His mouth closed over the sensitive spot beneath my breast, making me arch off the mattress. Tangling my fingers in his dark hair, I guided him lower. "Someone's eager tonight."

"Take me now, Alpha."

His eyes flashed obsidian as they locked with mine. I didn't need instruction - my legs fell open in invitation. A gasp tore from my throat as his tongue flicked over my clit before sucking hard, three fingers plunging deep. I could feel my arousal coating his fingers as he worked me relentlessly. The sudden withdrawal left me whimpering - until I felt him press against my back entrance.

"Tell me how it feels." His gruff command vibrated against my core as his tongue replaced his fingers.

"Sebastian!" My hips bucked wildly as I rode his face. A second finger joined the first, stretching me deliciously. "ALPHA!" My climax hit like a tidal wave, barely registering when he removed his mouth but kept his fingers moving inside me. The rapid thrusts had me relaxing completely, accepting him fully.

"That's my good girl, come for me." His husky praise sent another wave of pleasure through me. Before I could recover, something cold and vibrating pressed against my core. Where he'd produced this toy, I had no idea, but the relentless pace had me seeing stars.

Only when he withdrew everything did I get a moment to breathe - just in time for him to sheath himself fully in my dripping core. His head fell back in ecstasy as he began pounding into me. Hooking one leg over his shoulder, he pinned the other beneath him, bending me nearly in half without breaking rhythm.

I felt his release pulse inside me, but he didn't stop. Just as I teetered on the edge again, he withdrew and entered my back entrance, simultaneously pressing the vibrator against my clit.

"Fuck, Evelyn." His claws dug into my hips as he bottomed out. The dual stimulation was too much - my climax shattered through me with just three more thrusts.

Somehow, I found myself on all fours, the vibrator still humming against my front while Sebastian claimed me from behind. The intensity had me seeing stars, completely at his mercy as he drove us both toward another explosive release.

###Chapter 0277

Sebastian kept his promise and surpassed last night’s performance. Every inch of me ached as I dressed. The shower helped, but there was only so much relief it could offer after being stretched and filled in both holes at once.

"Why are you walking like that?" Sebastian smirked, leaning against the doorframe, his bare chest on display, shorts slung low on his hips. The way his arms flexed as he braced himself had my panties dampening all over again.

"I’m fine. Last night was… intense." I tried to sound casual, but my voice betrayed me.

Sebastian growled, pushing off the door and pinning me against the wall before I could blink. I was still in just my bra and panties, and when his hands found me, I melted instantly. One hand wrapped around my throat while the other tore my panties away, his fingers plunging inside me. My legs parted eagerly, welcoming his touch.

His lips never left mine as he freed himself and thrust into me. I was sore, but damn, he felt too good. His movements were controlled yet relentless, driving me harder against the wall with each stroke.

"Oh god—yes! Yes!" I moaned into his mouth, my head spinning, my body trembling. My legs turned to jelly, but he didn’t stop.

"Had enough?" His voice was rough with amusement and restraint.

I couldn’t speak. Every thrust sent me spiraling higher until, on my third climax, Sebastian finally spilled inside me. My legs gave out completely as he lowered me to the floor, his laughter ringing in my ears.

"That was…" I panted, struggling to form words.

"Perfect?" He grinned, stepping back. "You’ve got five minutes to get downstairs."

"How are you even standing?" I glared up at him.

"I’m built for this, love. Making you weak is my specialty."

"You’re too good at it," I muttered, patting his hand before collapsing again.

Once my breathing steadied, Sebastian dropped the bomb. "Now that you’re nice and relaxed… let’s talk about having a baby."

He tossed a sundress at me—white cotton with sunflowers, the straps thin, the hem fluttering just above mid-thigh.

"Seriously? You haven’t exactly been careful," I pointed out, pulling the dress over my head.

Sebastian smirked. "This’ll make it easier to keep you weak all day."

"All day?" My stomach fluttered with a mix of excitement and dread.

"I want a baby."

"What if I have twins?" I slipped on sandals, my legs still shaky. Sebastian watched, amused, as I struggled to stand.

"I want ten kids with you." He leaned against the bedroom door, arms crossed.

"Ten?" I scoffed, smoothing the dress and adjusting my hair in the mirror.

"At least." His grin was wicked. "And if I’m going to change my body for them, there better be one that’s mine."

I rolled my eyes, but my heart raced.

Sebastian was serious.

And I wasn’t sure if I was ready—or if I’d survive it.

###Chapter 0278

"You're absolutely insane." I giggled as we descended the grand staircase. The pack house buzzed with activity, every face glowing with laughter.

"Go claim your seat, darling. I'll fetch breakfast for you." Sebastian's deep voice sent shivers down my spine.

"Thank you, Alpha." His hand playfully swatted my backside as he walked away. Though I attempted a stern glare, my traitorous lips curved into an irrepressible smile.

Sophia and Oliver already occupied the head table, surrounded by a room three-quarters full of pack members. As I approached, Sophia's eyes lit up. "That dress is absolutely stunning!"

"Sebastian's choice," I replied, smoothing the fabric as I sat. "How's my favorite little niece or nephew doing?"

"Growing like a weed." Indeed, her belly seemed to have expanded overnight.

"You're the most radiant pregnant woman I've ever seen!" Oliver declared, resting his palm gently on her swollen abdomen.

"Just thrilled her hormones have stabilized," I teased.

"That's definitely a perk," Oliver agreed while Sophia rolled her eyes.

"I wasn't that bad," she protested. Our synchronized skeptical looks spoke volumes.

"If Godzilla had PMS, that was you," Oliver deadpanned.

"Oh? So now I'm some giant, lumbering monster?" Sophia's voice climbed an octave as she turned on him, just as Sebastian returned.

"What fresh chaos have I walked into?" Sebastian murmured, watching Oliver desperately backpedal.

"Oliver compared Sophia's mood swings to Godzilla's rampages."

"Damn. How many brain cells did he sacrifice today?" Sebastian arched an eyebrow.

Judging by Oliver's panicked expression, far too many.

We endured their bickering for several more minutes until the last stragglers arrived. The grand hall, our largest gathering space, now overflowed with pack members.

"Welcome everyone!" Sebastian's commanding voice silenced the room as he stood. "First, we extend our warmest greetings to our newest members. Before this meeting concludes, you'll formally renounce ties to Silvercrest Pack and pledge allegiance to Nightshade."

He paused, scanning for dissenters. "For those interested in extracurriculars, we're launching a youth warrior camp. While optional, I highly recommend it for teens aspiring to warrior status. Ladies, we've added a beginner's class focusing on self-defense."

"Our kitchen operates round-the-clock, though meals have scheduled hours. Lunch runs 11:30 to 12:30, dinner from 5:30 to 7. Room service is reserved for those medically confined. Remember - our staff deserves respect, not demands."

"Alpha?" A woman's voice interrupted from the rear.

###Chapter 0279

Evelyn nodded and took her seat. Sebastian waited for more questions, but the room remained silent. "Next topic: general pack rules. The walls of our packhouse are completely soundproof. There's a recreation room and a fully equipped gym at the back, open to all members. Teenagers usually organize pizza nights on Saturdays—they hang out, play games, sometimes even have bonfires. As long as they don't get too rowdy, I allow it. Keeps them out of trouble. Of course, Evelyn and I are available 24/7. For non-emergencies, try to stick to regular hours, but no one will be punished for reaching out after hours. With everything happening, we won't keep a fixed office schedule. Email is the best way to reach us."

Sophia stood up, holding up a flyer. "I've put together a list of upcoming events and activities. Copies are at the back for everyone."

A few murmurs rippled through the room, some members casting nervous glances at Sebastian, expecting reprimand for the interruption. Instead, he simply nodded. "Thank you," he said, skimming the flyer. "Beta Sophia has prepared these for everyone. They include all upcoming events. We still need to hold Evelyn's Luna ceremony, and some postponed activities will be rescheduled. Check the flyer for details—volunteers will be needed."

Damn, I completely forgot about the ceremony. "Thank you," Evelyn said to Sophia. "Add a prom and a welcome BBQ for our new members." Sophia jotted it down.

"Starting today, things will be hectic," Sebastian continued. "We’ll hold a funeral service for those we’ve lost—my parents, Alpha Benjamin and Luna Amelia, as well as our fallen warriors. Please come pay your respects. Afterward, everyone can continue settling in. Any questions?" His gaze swept the room.

Sophia stood again. "Actually, Alpha Sebastian, since we're all here—Luna Evelyn suggested a BBQ tonight as a welcome for our new members. It’ll give everyone a chance to meet and find activities they’re interested in. With everything else planned, tonight works best."

"Alright, BBQ tonight," Sebastian agreed, though he looked slightly puzzled. Evelyn suspected Sophia had mind-linked him, because his expression shifted almost immediately. "Does everyone know how to denounce their former ties?"

Nods all around. No objections.

"Good. Proceed, and I’ll accept you all at once."

Across the room, those who needed to severed their old bonds. Some clutched their chests, pain evident. A few children cried, feeling their parents' anguish, while others remained oblivious, still playing.

When the tension eased, Sebastian spoke. "I, Alpha Sebastian of the Silvercrest Pack, accept every one of you as my pack." His words were brief but firm. Murmurs of acceptance spread, each one sending a fresh wave of pressure through Evelyn’s skull as new bonds snapped into place.

###Chapter 0280

I lowered my head, squeezing my eyes shut as I processed everything. Passing out wasn’t an option, though the pain wasn’t nearly as overwhelming as when I had linked with Alpha Benjamin. At some point, Sebastian placed his hand on my shoulder, trying to ease the discomfort, but eventually, it faded, leaving only a dull, throbbing ache behind.

"Thank you all for coming," Sebastian finished, his voice steady. I glanced up at him. His grip on my shoulder remained firm as he addressed the gathered crowd.

As soon as he finished speaking, the attendees rose silently and filed out of the room, most taking a memorial flyer with them. Sebastian and I followed, walking side by side down the shaded path toward the funeral site. The Silvercrest Pack held their ceremonies in a secluded clearing near the tree line, a place of quiet reverence. We walked several hundred yards before reaching it.

The bodies lay atop pyres of wood and straw, arranged with care. No one spoke as they found their seats. We moved to the front, where Oliver attempted to hold the torch but faltered. His father, Beta Andrew, stepped in to take over. Somehow, that felt right.

"Thank you for being here," Sebastian said, his voice carrying across the clearing. "I know today is difficult. Stay as long as you need, but you’re free to leave once the burning begins."

He paused, then walked over to speak with Andrew briefly. Sebastian took a moment beside his parents—Alpha Benjamin and Luna Amelia. His final words to them were private, whispered between heartbeats. The grief in him was palpable, a storm of anger and reluctant acceptance. His mother’s passing had been expected, in a way. When one mate dies, the other rarely lingers long.

"Each of these sacrifices led to our victory," Sebastian continued, addressing the crowd. "Alpha Benjamin… Luna Amelia… and so many others. They fought with everything they had, standing as the best of us. I was honored to fight beside them."

His voice never wavered. "Their deaths saved countless lives. They brought peace to our lands, protected the vulnerable, and secured a future for the next generation. Luna Amelia—my mother—was kindness itself. She softened my father’s rough edges, loved unconditionally, and made every life she touched matter."

He swallowed hard before continuing. "And Alpha Benjamin… I owe him everything. He taught me to lead—not through fear, but by standing beside those who follow. Mistakes were made, but his love for his pack never wavered. He died defending his warriors. I will always be proud to call him my father… and my Alpha. May the Moon Goddess grant me even half his strength."

Sebastian stepped back, glancing at Andrew, who shook his head. With a nod, Sebastian signaled for the pyres to be lit. Andrew obeyed, starting with Alpha Benjamin’s, then Luna Amelia’s, until flames consumed each one.

Sebastian returned to my side, his hand settling on my thigh. I wrapped my arm around his, resting my head against his shoulder.

Ten minutes passed before people began to leave, one by one. Soon, only the four of us remained—Sebastian, Oliver, Andrew, and me. Andrew finally departed once Alpha Benjamin’s pyre had burned beyond recognition.

Sebastian rose, carefully moving each body to its resting place and covering them with earth. Most of the work had already been done, so it didn’t take long. Oliver wanted to help, but he was still too weak. His bruises had faded, though, and he sat straighter now, his strength slowly returning.

###Chapter 0281

Sebastian finished what he was doing and sat beside me, his breathing heavy. "What's next?" I asked, tilting my head.

"Now, we head to Florida and uncover what your mother left for you," Sebastian replied, his voice steady but laced with anticipation.

"That'll have to wait until next week. This week is packed," Sophia chimed in, scrolling through her tablet.

"Fine. One more week won't change anything," I sighed, running a hand through my hair.

"Take a ride with me?" Sebastian looked down at me, his dark eyes gleaming.

"A ride? On your bike?" I blinked, confused.

"Yeah. I need to check the conference center. The contractors said it was finished, but I haven’t seen it yet. Sophia has events scheduled there."

I glanced at Sophia. "Do we have time?"

"You do. I already blocked it out. Just be back at the shop by 4:30," she said with a knowing smile.

"What a bo—"

"Nope. Everything’s handled. The demo team is already working on the houses, and I’ve got most of the designs ready. Just need to send a few emails and sketch one more layout. There’s a ribbon-cutting at 4:30, but it’ll be quick. We’ll be back for the BBQ by six."

"God, I was worried about losing Audrey, but you’re a godsend," I said, leaning over to press a quick kiss to her cheek.

"Yeah, remember that in a few months when I need three weeks off," she teased, struggling to stand before finally getting her balance.

"Make it sooner rather than later. I want our kids to be the same age, and right now, you’re moving slow," I joked.

"I’ll work on it," I called as Sophia and Oliver walked away. "I should change first," I told Sebastian, who was already following them.

"Nope. Just sit on your dress. You’ll be fine," he said, pulling me against him and kissing me deeply. "I love you," he murmured against my lips.

"I love you too," I replied without hesitation.

We walked to our bikes, which were already waiting—Sebastian must’ve had someone bring them out. He handed me my helmet and gloves before putting on his own. Once he was ready, I started my bike.

The moment the engine roared to life, a thrill shot through me. It felt like reclaiming a lost part of myself. The wind whipped past as we sped down the driveway and onto the open road. Sebastian stayed ahead but kept glancing at me in his mirror, just like he used to before we were mates.

Butterflies fluttered in my stomach as I let my dress ride up when no cars were around. Sebastian’s tension melted away, replaced by something primal. His eyes darkened every time he caught me, but he never scolded me. The entire ride was exhilarating.

When we pulled up to the convention center, I was stunned. It looked incredible—lush trees shaded the parking lot, and the circular building with its domed roof exuded elegance and strength.

"What?" My heart sank slightly.

"I already had Andrew inspect it."

"Then why are we here?" I frowned, a little hurt.

"Our getaway is finished," Sebastian said, holding out his hand.

I’d completely forgotten about the treehouse. The path was narrow, the trees overgrown, but the builders had done an amazing job preserving the forest.

When I saw it, my breath caught. It was perfect—dark-stained wood, solar lights lining the walkway and balcony. Even in daylight, it was breathtaking.

###Chapter 0282

My heart raced as I dashed up the walkway, too excited to wait for Sebastian. Every room I explored brought new surprises, each more breathtaking than the last. Sebastian lingered on the balcony, his gaze following me with quiet amusement.

"This is incredible!" I threw my arms around his neck, and he caught me effortlessly, his lips meeting mine in a tender kiss.

"I knew you'd love it," he murmured against my mouth.

"I just need to use the restroom real quick."

Sebastian arched a brow. "Found it already?"

"Of course!" I flashed him a grin before slipping into the bathroom. Something had been nagging at me all day—a suspicion I couldn’t shake. Locking the door, I steadied my breathing and rummaged through the drawers until my fingers closed around what I needed.

There were no obvious signs, no symptoms, but with how reckless we'd been lately—and Sebastian's barely concealed longing for a child—I had to know. A quiet instinct had warned me not to drink tonight, even though my period wasn’t due for another two days.

Hands trembling, I tore open the package, sat down, and followed the instructions before capping the test and setting it aside. My legs shook as I washed my hands, the seconds crawling by. I couldn’t wait.

Snatching it up, I flipped it over before I could second-guess myself.

One bold line.

And beside it, a faint but unmistakable second line.

Positive.

I was pregnant.

"Oh my god," I whispered, a slow, disbelieving smile spreading across my face. One hand flew to my mouth while the other clutched the test, my pulse roaring in my ears.

A thousand thoughts collided in my mind. I wanted to surprise Sebastian, but there was no way I could keep this to myself. The urge to run to him, to tell him right now, burned through me. And the best part? I wasn’t afraid. Not when I knew how overjoyed he’d be.

Tucking the test into my pocket, I stepped back onto the balcony. Sebastian leaned against the railing, his back to me as he surveyed the city below.

"Was starting to think you got lost in there," he teased, pulling me against him. His arms wrapped around me, his chin resting on my shoulder as we took in the glittering skyline.

"How are you feeling?" I asked softly.

"Happy. Sad. Overwhelmed." He exhaled. "Burying your parents isn’t something you ever prepare for. But losing you? That terrified me more."

I turned in his arms to face him. "You’ll never lose me. I’d tear the world apart to get back to you."

Sebastian smirked. "Since when did you get so sentimental?"

"I’m not sentimental," I retorted, poking his chest. "I just don’t share what’s mine."

His hands slid under my dress, gripping my thighs as he lifted me onto the railing. The movement jostled the test from my pocket, sending it clattering to the ground.

Sebastian stilled. "What was that?"

"Shit." I groaned as he bent to pick it up.

"This wasn’t how I planned to tell you," I admitted.

Sebastian froze, his fingers tightening around the plastic stick. One hand still braced against me, the other holding the test with its two pink lines.

His voice was barely a whisper. "This is a pregnancy test."

"Yeah," I breathed. "I just took it."

The world seemed to stop.

And then Sebastian’s eyes met mine—wide, stunned, and blazing with something fierce and tender all at once.
###Chapter 0283

"Correct. We're pregnant." I watched Sebastian's face carefully as the words sank in.

His golden eyes widened. "You're carrying my child?" His voice was barely above a whisper, as if afraid speaking louder would shatter this reality. "Are you serious?"

"Dead serious. I'm pregnant, and you're going to be a father."

For a long moment, Sebastian just stared at me. Then, without warning, he crushed his lips against mine in a kiss so fierce it stole my breath. His arms wrapped around me, pulling me flush against his chest, his heartbeat wild against my skin. When he finally pulled back, his eyes were glistening.

"How... when did... why didn't you..." He fumbled over his words, gaze dropping to the pregnancy test in my hand.

"I thought it would be negative. I don't have any symptoms—my period isn't even late yet. But something told me not to drink tonight. And considering how reckless we've been..."

Sebastian dropped to his knees, pressing his face against my stomach. "Hey there, little one," he murmured, voice thick with emotion. "Daddy's here. You're already so loved."

I threaded my fingers through his dark hair, watching as he processed the news. After several quiet moments, he lifted his head. "You're really okay with this?"

His hands slid around my waist as I straddled his lap. "The danger is over now. Before, I was terrified something would happen—that I'd lose the baby. But now..."

Sebastian growled low in his throat, nipping at my neck. "I'll spoil you rotten."

"I don't need spoiling," I breathed, dragging his hand up to my mouth. Keeping my eyes locked on his, I slowly licked his fingers. His pupils dilated, and with a rough sound, he shoved them back inside me.

"Fuck me, Sebastian," I moaned as his teeth grazed my throat.

Instead of giving me what I wanted, he flipped us so I was beneath him. His lips trailed fire down my body—my collarbone, the swell of my breasts, the dip of my stomach.

"So perfect," he murmured before his tongue found my clit.

The slow, deliberate strokes were torture. "Please, Alpha," I begged, hips arching off the bed. "I need you inside me."

Sebastian chuckled darkly, fingers working me with agonizing precision. Just as I teetered on the edge, he pinched my clit, sending me spiraling. Before I could recover, he sheathed himself inside me with one smooth thrust.

His pace was maddeningly slow.

"No," I gasped, shoving at his shoulders until he sat back against the headboard. Ripping off my panties, I climbed onto his lap, sinking down with a moan.

Sebastian's hands gripped my hips as I rode him, his head falling back with a groan. "Fuck, Evelyn."

I leaned back, rolling my hips in slow circles, watching his control unravel. His claws pricked my skin, his growls growing rougher.

This was exactly where I belonged.

###Chapter 0284

"You're making this incredibly difficult, woman," Sebastian growled through clenched teeth.

My fingers dug into his shoulders as I moved against him, my rhythm matching his. His hands guided my hips, keeping our pace steady. My fangs descended instinctively, and Sebastian pulled me flush against his chest.

As pleasure crashed over me, my fangs sank deep into his shoulder, piercing until they met bone. His arms tightened around me like steel bands, holding me in place until I finally withdrew, licking the wound clean.

Sebastian didn’t hesitate. His own fangs pierced my skin, and I gasped as the sharp sting melted into pleasure. His arms remained locked around me, keeping me steady as my head fell back.

When his release hit, my body ignited, every nerve alight with ecstasy.

He finally pulled away, but his grip didn’t loosen. Instead, he leaned back, keeping me pressed against him. Every now and then, I could feel him twitch inside me, but I stayed still, my head resting on his chest, listening to the steady beat of his heart.

"We should get going," I murmured, glancing at the clock—3:15 PM.

"Yeah, wouldn’t want to miss your ribbon-cutting ceremony." Sebastian tilted my chin up and kissed me softly, his lips lingering just a second longer than necessary.

I cupped his face between my hands, staring into his deep, stormy eyes. "Sebastian… I love you so much."

"You have no idea how much I love you," he murmured before capturing my lips again. This kiss wasn’t just passion—it was devotion, protection, and acceptance. He was my soul’s other half.

When he finally released me, I slid off him and grabbed my dress and underwear, heading to the bathroom to clean up. Sebastian disappeared into another bathroom, and by the time I was done, he was already dressed and waiting.

"We’re not telling anyone about this yet, right?" Sebastian asked as he secured my helmet on my head.

"Not yet. It’s too early—only a few weeks. I want to wait until later. No sickness or anything yet."

Sebastian helped me onto my bike, something he never usually did. Normally, he’d just toss me the helmet. This small gesture made me wonder—was he going to be extra protective now that I was pregnant?

"Okay," he agreed.

"Do you want to tell people?" I asked as he swung his leg over his own bike.

"I can’t wait to announce to the entire pack that you’re carrying my pup," he admitted, a mischievous glint in his eyes. That look told me one thing—this was going to be a long pregnancy. He was going to be insufferably doting. Part of me loved it. The other part knew I was still perfectly capable of handling myself.

"I’m still going to work out and rebuild my strength," I reminded him through the mind-link as we started our bikes and hit the road.

"With moderation, you can."

"Moderation?"

"You don’t need to be squatting 150 pounds, Evelyn."

"You do realize a healthy workout routine is good for me and the baby, right?"

"Yes, but you haven’t trained in months. Your body isn’t used to it anymore. I’m not saying don’t work out—just don’t push yourself too hard. Please." He glanced back at me, and even through the helmet, I could see the raw concern in his gaze.

"Fine, I’ll take it easy," I relented, feeling his worry pulse through our bond.

"Sebastian?"

"Yeah?"

###Chapter 0285

"Why the hesitation? Money isn't an issue..."

"It's not about money," Sebastian murmured, his fingers brushing against mine. "I always imagined raising our children in the packhouse."

"We still can," I said, though my chest tightened at his words.

His gaze softened. "I just want you happy, Evelyn. If living in our own home makes you happy, then that's what we'll do."

The response felt hollow, like he was conceding rather than agreeing. "We can talk about this later," I suggested, trying to keep my voice steady. He didn't argue, but silence settled between us—not uncomfortable, but heavy with unspoken thoughts.

Had I ruined the moment? The sheer joy of discovering I was pregnant had been eclipsed by my request for a house.

When we pulled up to the tattoo parlor, the scene took me by surprise. Cameramen adjusted their equipment near vans, a red carpet stretched across the pavement, and a podium stood proudly at the entrance, adorned with an extravagant red ribbon.

"Perfect timing!" Sophia rushed toward us as I dismounted my bike.

"This is... more than I expected," I admitted, scanning the bustling setup.

Her grin was infectious. "I went all out. And I had plenty of help."

"From who?"

"From us!" Audrey and Grayson rounded the corner, followed closely by Cassandra and Nathan.

"Thank you all for coming!" I embraced each of them, warmth flooding my chest.

Nathan nudged my shoulder playfully. "Miss this? Not a chance!"

I exhaled, overwhelmed. "After everything we've been through... this feels like a fresh start." My gaze drifted to the shop—my shop. The exterior gleamed, the bulletproof glass now bearing a sleek decal of a tattoo needle etching the letter E.

"Ready?" a voice called.

Sophia grabbed my hand, tugging me forward. "Here's the plan: Melanie will introduce the shop, then cue you for the ribbon-cutting. After that, everyone tours inside. Questions?"

A man with an earpiece rattled off instructions as if I should recognize him.

"None," I said, though nerves fluttered in my stomach. I stood center-stage, only Melanie beside me. "Can my family join me up here?"

"Of course. Have them stand just behind you."

Sebastian took his place at my side, his arm slipping around my waist as Sophia hovered nearby. Audrey and Cassandra positioned themselves in front of Grayson and Nathan.

This was right.

The countdown began—three fingers, two, one...

"Tonight, we celebrate the grand reopening of Ink & Soul," Melanie announced. "Earlier this year, this establishment fell victim to a devastating break-in. But after a complete renovation, Evelyn Andrews is ready to welcome you back." She turned to me. "Evelyn, what does this mean to you?"

Damn. I hadn't prepared a speech.

"This... this is everything," I began, voice steadying. "Tattooing isn't just a job—it's my passion. No one will stop me from living this dream."

"What changes have you made?"

"Enhanced security, for one. Plus, a full redesign and extra stations for future artists."

Melanie smiled. "With this ribbon-cutting, it's clear Ink & Soul has an incredible future ahead." She stepped back, nodding at me.

I gripped the oversized scissors.

The ribbon fell.

Applause erupted.

###Chapter 0286

The moment I stepped into my shop after everything was finally complete, the weight of what this meant hit me like a tidal wave.

Everything gleamed—polished surfaces, freshly hung artwork, the soft glow of under-cabinet lighting. Even my computers were perfectly set up, waiting for me.

Melanie circled the space with her camera, offering a few polished words before shutting it off. "That's a wrap! Thank you for having us!" She extended her hand, her manicured nails and designer heels making her tower over me despite my height.

"The pleasure was mine," I said smoothly.

She pulled out a business card, scribbled something on the back, and then sauntered over to Sebastian. "Here's my card. If you ever need another expert, don’t hesitate to call. I added my personal number—in case you want to discuss business after hours."

Sebastian just stared at her, but I wasn’t about to let that slide.

"I'll take that," I said, snatching the card from her fingers. "My husband won’t be calling you. He prefers women who aren’t so… desperate."

Melanie arched a brow, shifting her weight to one hip. "We’ll see about that."

Sebastian caught my wrist as she strutted out. "I wouldn’t have actually hurt her," I muttered.

"Yes, you would have," he chuckled, pulling me into a hug. "And we’ve had enough trouble for one day."

"I KNEW IT!" Sophia shrieked.

I pulled back, frowning. "Knew what?"

"YOU DO GET JEALOUS!" She bounced on her toes, clapping like a child.

"Not jealous," I corrected. "Just protective. There’s a difference. She’s not a wolf—she has no idea what I could do to her. Humans are reckless, and I was just keeping him safe."

"That’s a lot of words for jealousy," Nathan teased.

"I’ll kick your ass too," I shot back, glaring.

"Evelyn!" Audrey called from behind the front desk. "We have one last surprise for you."

I turned, confused, as she emerged holding a massive leather-bound book. My breath caught—it was a portfolio, the kind artists use to showcase their best work.

"You got me a new one?"

"Sort of." She flipped it open to reveal the cover—a silver crescent moon with two wolves howling beneath it. The leather was fresh, its scent rich and new. Sebastian took it from her and opened it for me.

My heart stopped.

Page after page displayed my earliest tattoos, each one perfectly photographed. The details, the shading, the artistry—all preserved.

"I don’t understand…"

"Sebastian wanted to give you something back," Audrey explained. "We tracked down every client we could find who had your work and asked for photos."

Sebastian turned to the last page—his own back piece, blown up and framed, now hanging proudly behind the front desk.

"Thank you," I choked out, throwing my arms around his neck. He held me tight, letting me steady myself against him.

"You know," he murmured through our mind-link, "we should probably tell them you’re pregnant. Otherwise, they’ll wonder why you’re not drinking at the barbecue tonight."

"You’re that eager to tell them?" I laughed as I pulled away, then hugged Audrey.

"Thank you," I whispered.

"It’s the least I could do," she said, eyes glistening.

"I am," Sebastian replied in the link.

"Fine," I sighed aloud. "But you tell them."

I grabbed his forearm—not his hand, just his arm—suddenly nervous.

Sebastian cleared his throat as everyone gathered in a loose circle. "Thank you all for everything you’ve done—for her, for us. With everything that’s happened, having you all here has been the only thing keeping us sane. Keeping me sane. Keeping Evelyn safe." He hesitated, uncharacteristically nervous. "We wish Oliver could’ve been here… but Evelyn and I have some news to share."

###Chapter 0287

Sophia's eyes widened in excitement. "You're finally going to Italy?"

I laughed. "No."

"Florida, then?" Grayson asked, tilting his head.

"Yeah, we're going next week, but that's not what he's trying to say," I replied, glancing at Sebastian.

Nathan crossed his arms, grinning. "So, where are you traveling? You've been dreaming about this forever." The others nodded in agreement, their gazes shifting between us.

Sebastian wrapped an arm around my waist, his voice warm. "We're not planning anything beyond Florida yet. We'll have to wait until next year."

Sophia blinked. "Next year? Why?"

Sebastian’s grin widened, pride lighting up his face. "Because… Evelyn is pregnant."

Sophia shrieked. "WHAT?!" She pressed her hands to her cheeks. "I'm not going to cry… I swear I'm not going to cry—"

"Seriously?!" Grayson practically shoved Audrey aside and scooped me up, spinning me in a tight circle before setting me back down. "You're pregnant? I get to be an uncle?"

"You do," I confirmed, laughing as he hugged me again.

Audrey shot him a glare. "If you weren’t her brother, I’d be cutting something off right now." She nudged him aside and beamed at me. "I'm so happy for you."

"You get to be Auntie Audrey," I teased, hugging her back.

Grayson clapped Sebastian on the shoulder, pulling him into a rough hug before shaking his hand. Nathan followed suit, grinning.

Sophia wiped at her eyes, losing the battle against tears. "How far along are you?"

"Not very. I’m not even due to miss my period for another two days," I admitted. "I just had this weird feeling I shouldn’t drink, so I took a test."

Sebastian pulled the test from his pocket, showing it off like a trophy.

Sophia squinted at it. "No symptoms yet?"

"None."

"That’s bullshit," she sniffed, "but I’m so happy for you." She finally hugged me as Sebastian tucked the test away.

Cassandra stepped forward, smiling warmly. "Congratulations!" She wrapped me in a gentle embrace, her usual reserved demeanor softening.

Grayson was still trying to make amends with Audrey, but she kept dodging his attempts to kiss her.

Sophia bounced on her toes. "Are you going to find out the gender?"

I shrugged. "Haven’t thought about it. Or names, before you ask." I glanced at Sebastian, who was just staring at me like I’d hung the moon.

Audrey smirked. "Do you want your crib now?"

"Definitely. No clue where we’ll put it, but yes," I said.

Sophia gave me a pointed look. "Knowing the gender means you can actually prepare properly."

"Just because Oliver wants to keep it a surprise doesn’t mean I can’t be ready," I shot back, ducking under Sebastian’s arm.

Sophia threw her hands up. "I don’t know if I should buy a dress or tiny athletic shorts!"

"Girls can wear athletic shorts!" I argued.

"Just because you refuse to dress up doesn’t mean other girls don’t like to!" she huffed. "If this is a girl, Oliver is going to spoil her rotten."

I smirked. "Watching you navigate this is going to be hilarious."

"Just you wait!" she warned.

"I don’t have to. I’ll just learn from your mistakes," I teased.

Grayson laughed, pulling Audrey along with him and slinging an arm around Sophia. "Alright, before someone pops a vein, let’s get to that BBQ!"

"You’re coming too?" I asked.

"Most of my pack is," he said. "Sophia called this morning and invited us. Gives everyone a chance to mingle."

I leaned in, whispering in Sebastian’s ear, "If I can’t drink, neither can you." Then I shot him a look and walked away.

He raised a brow, amused, and followed.

Grabbing the keys, I locked the door and headed toward our bikes.

"Is that so?" Sebastian murmured as he passed me, heading to his own bike.

"It’s only fair," I laughed. "Kidding. Do whatever you want. I wouldn’t actually stop you." I rolled my eyes and pulled on my helmet.

He didn’t respond, just secured his own helmet.

I revved my engine and took off before he even started his bike.

The race was on.

I wasn’t speeding—not recklessly, anyway—but this might be the last time I’d ride until after the baby arrived.

And I was going to enjoy every second of it.

###Chapter 0288

The Silvercrest packhouse was teeming with people when we arrived. Faces I hadn't seen in years mingled about. Though I might have glimpsed them at funerals before, this was the first time I could actually speak with them.

"I need to change first," I told Sebastian as I dismounted my bike.

"Change?" His eyebrows knitted together in confusion. "Why?"

"I smell like sex," I admitted, pointing to a barely noticeable dried spot on the inner lining of my dress. "And there's evidence right here."

Sebastian merely smirked. "So?"

Rolling my eyes, I declared, "I'm changing. Be right back!" I tugged his shirt collar down for a quick kiss before darting upstairs. With my pregnancy starting to show, I needed something that flattered my figure while maintaining professionalism.

Hidden in the back of my closet was a sundress Sophia had gifted me months ago - one I'd always been too shy to wear. But today, feeling confident in my own skin, I finally pulled it out. Slipping off my sunflower print dress, I opted for just white lace underwear beneath.

The spaghetti-strapped dress hugged my curves perfectly, the fitted bodice providing enough support to go braless. A delicate golden belt cinched at my natural waist, flowing down into a white skirt adorned with pink and rose floral patterns. Though the hem stopped mid-thigh, the fabric was weighted enough to prevent any wardrobe malfunctions. Strappy gold sandals completed the look as I touched up my hair.

Knock knock knock!

"Sophia?" I opened the door to find my beaming best friend.

"Damn, you look incredible!" She did an exaggerated once-over.

"You think so?" I twirled for her inspection.

"Absolutely! Sebastian sent me to check on you." Her grin widened impossibly further.

"Why?" I tilted my head.

"Because you're wearing the perfect dress, obviously." She grabbed my wrist and dragged me down the hallway.

"I don't understand..."

"Just smile and follow my lead." Sophia guided me to the back door. When she opened it, I realized this was no ordinary barbecue. Sebastian had changed into crisp slacks and a white polo, standing at the end of a flower-lined path that cut through the gathered crowd.

With a gentle push, Sophia nudged me forward and closed the door behind me. My feet moved automatically down the petal-strewn path toward Sebastian. When I reached him, he took both my hands, his gaze piercing straight to my soul.

"We'll still have your official Luna ceremony with all the food and decorations you chose," he began, voice thick with emotion. "But after everything we've been through, I wanted to give you this now." From his pocket, he produced a ring I instantly recognized - his mother's heirloom. "This has been passed down through generations. Every Luna from my great-great-grandmother to my mother wore this ring. She intended to give it to you at your ceremony, but I believe the true Luna should wear it now."

He slid the ring onto my finger as he continued, "This symbolizes our unity - not just as mates, but as partners leading this pack together. You've already proven your dedication to every person here, risking your life repeatedly to protect others. Please accept this as we begin our next chapter."

All I could manage was a tearful nod as the cool metal settled against my skin.

###Chapter 0289

"Are you ready?" Sebastian asked as he stepped onto the private jet. A full week had passed since we discovered I was pregnant. I'd visited the doctor, confirming the pregnancy—a healthy one so far, with no symptoms yet. At just four weeks, we hadn't told anyone else, though Sophia had immediately spilled the news to Oliver.

I sat in the plush leather seat, my fingers tracing the intricate platinum band on my finger. A single black one-carat diamond, cut in a perfect circle, glinted under the cabin lights. The twisting design of the band was a legacy—Sebastian’s great-great-grandfather had mined the stone and crafted the original ring. Over the years, the metal had been replaced, but the stone and design remained untouched.

"Earth to Evelyn!" Sebastian waved a hand between my face and the ring, snapping me out of my trance.

"What?" I blinked up at him, startled.

"Ready to go?" He settled beside me, his breathing slightly uneven from hauling our luggage.

"Did you get everything?" I asked, though I already knew the answer. He'd refused to let me lift a finger, insisting I rest.

"All set." He glanced back at the pilot and nodded. The flight attendant secured the door, and moments later, the world outside the window blurred as we lifted into the sky.

Once we leveled above the clouds, the attendant approached. "Can I get you anything to drink, Luna?"

"No, thank you." I offered a polite smile before turning back to the window.

"Alpha? Whiskey or water?"

"I'm good," Sebastian replied. He hadn’t touched alcohol since we found out—not even a sip. "You feeling okay?"

"Just tired." That was my only "symptom," if you could even call it that. The past week had been a whirlwind—new housing developments for incoming pack members, job reassignments, and endless meetings. The kitchen staff was thrilled with the new recruits, already swapping recipes.

Grayson and Audrey had secretly delivered a crib and baby supplies, hiding them in our room. Everyone assumed it was from my mother, so no questions were raised.

"Come here." Sebastian shifted closer, letting me rest my head against his chest. The steady hum of the engines lulled me into a light doze.

"Evelyn, we’re here." His voice, soft but firm, pulled me back.

I squinted against the bright sunlight as the plane descended. Below us, the ocean stretched endlessly, glittering under the midday sun.

Nerves coiled in my stomach as we touched down—not from flying, but from what might be waiting in that storage unit. Sebastian helped me up as the attendant lowered the stairs. Outside, a team was already loading our luggage into a waiting SUV.

"The keys are in the ignition, sir," one of the humans said. Sebastian must have arranged for private services.

"Thank you." He opened the passenger door for me before circling to the driver’s side.

"Where are we going?" I asked, unsure if we were heading to the hotel first.

"Where do you want to go?"

"To the unit." My fingers tightened around the seatbelt. "I need to know what’s inside."

###Chapter 0290

Sebastian nodded as he entered the address into the GPS. 318 Crestview Drive, Destin. The location popped up instantly. We were only fifteen minutes away from the biggest secret my father had ever kept from me.

His fingers curled around mine, stopping my nervous tapping on the center console. "Breathe, Evelyn."

"I am trying." The traffic was chaotic, and the unfamiliar sight of palm trees swaying violently in the wind was mesmerizing. The air carried a sharp, salty tang—proof that the ocean was close.

The GPS guided us into a gated community. An elderly security guard leaned out of his booth, his expression stern. "Unit number?"

I hesitated. "Uh…"

"Check the key. There should be a number on it," he said impatiently.

Fumbling with the envelope, I pulled out the key. A single digit was engraved on it. "Four," I told him.

His eyebrows shot up. "Four?"

"Yes, four." I held it up so Sebastian could see.

The guard muttered something under his breath before disappearing into his booth. He returned with a clipboard. "Sign this."

Sebastian passed it to me. It was a simple acknowledgment form confirming receipt of the envelope. "What's this for?" he asked.

"No idea," the guard admitted. "Years ago, we were instructed that if anyone came for this unit, they'd receive that letter. We just need proof it was delivered and to assist you if needed."

I signed the form and handed it back. "Thank you."

"Unit four is at the far left end. Let me know if you need anything else." He bowed slightly before opening the gates.

"That was… strange," I murmured once we were out of earshot. The place was undeniably luxurious—white brick walls at least fifteen feet high, security cameras everywhere.

Sebastian drove slowly down the row until we spotted the number 4. He turned off the engine but didn’t move. Instead, he cupped my chin, forcing me to meet his gaze. "Breathe, love."

I sucked in a sharp breath I hadn’t realized I was holding. "I don’t know why I’m so nervous."

"I’m right here with you." His eyes held mine, steady and reassuring. "Ready?"

I nodded, unable to speak. "Should I read the letter first?"

"Yeah. Go ahead." His hand settled on my thigh, warm and grounding.

Carefully, I unfolded the delicate paper. The handwriting was elegant, flowing—undeniably my mother’s.

My dearest Evelyn,

If you’re reading this, I didn’t survive childbirth. Your father thought I was paranoid when I voiced my concerns. Even the doctor dismissed me. So, I took matters into my own hands and wrote this letter.

There’s so much I wanted for you—to watch you grow, find your mate, become the strongest version of yourself. I wanted to be there for every moment.

I left instructions with your father about what to do with these belongings if I passed and if they were no longer safe at home. Florida has always been special to me. My parents brought me here as a child, and I dreamed of bringing you one day. By moving everything here, I ensured you’d at least visit the beach once in your life. I hope you fall in love with it as I did.

This unit holds things I hope you’ll treasure—family heirlooms, irreplaceable and valuable. I had them appraised years ago, but you may need to update that. Still, my wish is that you keep them, not sell them. Pass them down to your own children one day.

###Chapter 0291

Just know, I will be watching you from above. I am proud of you and I love you.

Love,
Mom

"If we have a daughter, can we name her Adalynn?" My voice was steady, though my chest felt hollow. No tears fell—just a quiet numbness settling in.

Sebastian pressed a soft kiss to my forehead. "Of course. It's a beautiful way to honor your mother." His fingers brushed against mine as he reached for the key. "Ready to see what's inside?"

"I am."

The Florida heat wrapped around us like a thick blanket as I stepped out of the car. Sebastian had already moved ahead, wrestling with the lock on the storage unit door. Years of humidity had rusted it slightly, but with a sharp twist, it gave way.

The door creaked open, revealing a space draped in white sheets. Dust particles danced in the sunlight as Sebastian pulled the first cover away.

Golden frames. Dozens of them.

Each held a hand-drawn sketch—some of landscapes, others of faces I didn’t recognize. Sebastian and I sifted through them until his fingers stilled.

"Look at the signature," he murmured.

In the bottom right corner, delicate cursive spelled out Adalynn Jeffrey.

"Mom drew these?" My breath caught.

Sebastian grinned. "Guess that’s where you get your talent." He left me to examine them while he continued uncovering the rest.

Behind the paintings, we found more—an easel, tubes of dried paint, stacks of art books. It looked like my mother had studied formally.

"Sebastian," I called, running my fingers over a sketch of a sunset. "She was incredible."

Then, from the back of the unit, his voice sharpened with surprise. "Evelyn—come look at this."

I turned to find him standing before a massive mirror. He’d swung it open like a cabinet door, revealing rows upon rows of jewelry.

But what caught my eye was the envelope taped to the top.

Sebastian peeled it free and flipped through the papers inside. "Appraisals," he said. Then his eyes widened. "This ring was valued at a million dollars." He pointed to a ruby set in gold, its facets catching the light.

"You're joking."

"Twenty years ago, it was worth that. Now? Probably triple."

My pulse quickened as I spotted another box beside the mirror, stuffed with vanilla envelopes. I opened the first one.

Bonds.

"Holy hell." Sebastian snatched the paper from my hands, scanning it. "Your mother left a fortune in here."

"It's all ours now."

We tore through more boxes—fur coats, antique vases, delicate china. Everything of value her family had owned was stored here, preserved.

Sebastian exhaled sharply. "We need to keep this quiet. No one can know."

"Buy a bank?" I joked weakly.

He smirked. "I was kidding, but… we could."

I shook my head, turning back to the paintings. Over a hundred, some signed by my mother, others by women who must have been her relatives. "What do we do with all of this?"

"Take it home. Hang what you love. Give some to Grayson. The jewelry stays locked up—we don’t need the money, but it’s good to have." He paused. "Your father’s inheritance is already secure. This? This is for dreams. A house. A future."

I nodded, but my mother’s last wish tugged at me. "Let’s go to the beach. I need to see it—for her."

Sebastian didn’t hesitate. "Anything for you."

In one smooth motion, he scooped me up, kissing me deeply before carrying me to the car. As he locked the unit behind us, something settled inside me.

I didn’t need to search for happiness anymore.

It was already here.

Sebastian slid into the driver’s seat, the engine purring to life. His hand found my stomach as we pulled away, his touch warm, grounding.

The ocean was calling.

And for the first time in years, so was peace.

###Chapter 0292

Greetings, my amazing readers!

I wasn’t planning to dive into the sequel so soon, but after a long chat with my editor, I’ve decided to continue this journey with all of you! From this point forward, the story will primarily follow Grayson and Audrey, though Evelyn and Sebastian will still make appearances. Since so many of you have been asking for Audrey’s perspective, I’m thrilled to give you a deeper look into her world!

We’re picking up right where we left off—no gaps, no delays. If you have any burning questions, drop them in the comments, and I’ll be sure to answer!

###Chapter 0293
Grayson and Audrey's Story
Audrey's POV

"Is everything going well in here?" Grayson stepped into our shared office. After the recent renovations, the entire packhouse felt brighter and more inviting. The lightly stained hardwood floors complemented the white distressed furniture perfectly. But my favorite part was our desks—each with its own designated space.

We'd knocked down a wall, transforming a spare bedroom into this open workspace. At my request, Grayson had installed a floor-to-ceiling glass wall that flooded the room with natural light.

Right now, I was debating which paintings to hang. Since Evelyn had everything moved back from storage last week, she and Grayson had divided most of their mother's belongings. She kept the jewelry but generously shared the paintings and sketches with him.

"I think this charcoal wolf portrait should go behind your desk," I suggested, holding it up. "And this owl sketch would look perfect behind mine."

Grayson's desk stood where his father's used to be, while mine occupied the former bedroom space. Matching rugs defined our areas, with a shared seating zone between them. We'd removed the bedroom door, leaving one entrance, but installed a collapsible partition for privacy when needed.

"Okay," Grayson agreed, leaning against my desk.

"You don't really care, do you?" I teased, both amused and slightly annoyed. I valued his opinion but secretly wanted it to align with mine. Truthfully, I could be stubborn about decor—Evelyn had always given me free rein, never interfering with my creative process. But with Grayson being my mate, I wanted our dynamic to be different.

"I do care," he said, gazing out the window distractedly. "I just trust your judgment. You have a better eye for this."

I sensed his tension immediately. Grayson only got this anxious when broaching topics he knew I'd dislike.

"Your... Vivienne is being discharged from the hospital today."

My body stiffened. I'd known this was coming, yet I hadn't visited since our first meeting. Despite promising to return, something always stopped me at the hospital doors. The staff had seen me hesitate multiple times but never pressured me to enter.

Memories flashed—Vivienne lying broken in that hospital bed, bandages covering her neck, bruises marring her arms. Xavier had seemed dangerous, someone who put me on edge. And though I wasn't as close to Liam as Grayson was, I still struggled to forgive him.

"Oh?" I managed, picking up the owl sketch to examine it against my cream-colored walls. The dark tones created a striking contrast.

"I need to know what you want," Grayson said gently. "Should they stay on the other side of the packhouse, or closer to us?"

"When will their house be ready?" I asked, avoiding the real question—how much distance I needed from the woman who'd given me life.

###Chapter 0294

"I know. I-I just can't understand why I'm feeling like this. Why don't I want to see them?" I searched Grayson's eyes, desperate for an answer.

But the pity in his gaze told me I wouldn't get one. Nineteen years of believing they abandoned you. That kind of hurt doesn't vanish in a week. His voice softened. "You're allowed to be angry, Evelyn. No one expects you to just forgive and forget."

"I'm not like Scarlett. I can't just shrug it off and move on. I feel things—deeply." A bitter edge crept into my words. Sometimes, it felt like Grayson compared us, even if he denied it.

"You need to find your own way to handle this," he said carefully. "Unless you want to send them to live with Sebastian and Scarlett, they're staying here. I'll even let you punch Xavier a few times if it helps?" His attempt at humor fell flat.

"Handle it how? Play the perfect, forgiving daughter?" The suggestion made my blood boil.

"That's not what I said." Grayson sighed. "I meant you need to face it. If you need to scream at them, do it. If you want to lock them in their room, fine. But ignoring it won't make it disappear. Whatever you choose, I'll stand by you." His hand brushed my stomach. "This baby deserves a home without resentment. And we don’t even live here full-time. They won’t be in our space."

My fingers curled over my belly. I’d only just found out I was pregnant yesterday. Grayson had been insufferably happy, grinning like an idiot ever since.

But I didn’t want our child growing up in a house full of tension. Flinching at raised voices. Watching their back. I understood why Scarlett was the way she was—but I refused to be like that.

My shelter for abandoned kids was already under construction. Plans were in motion to change the school system for gifted students. Scarlett had started the movement, but I wanted more. Secretly, I’d been drafting reforms I wished had existed when I was a teenager. Now, I had the power to make them real.

"Fine. Put them wherever in the packhouse. You're right—we don’t live here. If I need space, I’ll go home." I hesitated. "But Vivienne and Xavier cannot know where our house is."

"Whatever makes you comfortable." Grayson pulled me into his arms. "I’ll be with you every step of the way."

"I wish I had someone here with me. Cassandra’s getting better, but she’s not… Sophia. Or Scarlett."

Grayson frowned. "I thought you and Cassandra got along?"

"We do," I admitted. "But she’s still healing. I can’t talk to her like I could with Sophia or Scarlett. Sometimes, it feels like she needs guidance more than friendship."

"Maybe she thinks you don’t see her as a friend," Grayson said quietly.

I jerked back. "What?"

"Nathan told me she confessed she feels alone here. She wants to be closer to you."

My stomach twisted. "I like Cassandra! She’s just so quiet—I assumed she wasn’t ready, so I didn’t push." The realization hit hard. "Does she really believe that?"

###Chapter 0295

"She does. Scarlett is your beta now, and perhaps you should test her abilities with a few tasks. Start by having her organize the kitchen schedules for the packhouse. We used to have monthly menus, but lately, it's been chaotic—no one knows what to buy, and responsibilities keep overlapping."

"Why didn’t anyone tell me?" My heart sank at the realization.

"Seriously? You’ve been buried under securing shelter for everyone. How many housing projects are we juggling for our new members? Not to mention you and Evelyn are still insisting on throwing a prom. Then there are your and Evelyn’s upcoming Luna ceremonies. And let’s not forget the massive inter-pack gathering you’re planning."

"That’s for their benefit! Evelyn and I want to give our unmated members a chance—those who’ve never found their mates or lost theirs. Inviting multiple packs increases those odds."

"Sweetheart, I support the idea, but you’re drowning in responsibilities. You’re refusing Cassandra’s help and brushing off Vivienne and Xavier. I know you see the grand vision, but you can’t ignore the immediate fires here."

He was right, but I’d never admit it. "Fine, but the prom is happening," I said stubbornly. My stomach fluttered as I remembered the daring dress I’d bought for the occasion.

Grayson chuckled. "Since it’s Monday and the event’s this Saturday, I’ll allow it." He released me and turned to leave.

"Where are you going?" I sank into my chair.

"Checking on Scarlett—it’s her first day back after training the new warriors. They’re on break now, but we’ll resume soon. I want to assess her progress before we continue evaluating their strengths and weaknesses." He grabbed his keys and wallet.

"How’s that going?" I pulled out a blank sheet of paper.

"No expectations, so it’s fine. Xavier starts tomorrow—the recruits are eager to spar with him."

"And you?" I glanced up as he walked back toward me.

"Absolutely." Grayson leaned down, his lips brushing mine gently. His fingers traced my jaw as he tugged me closer.

"Can you deliver this to Evelyn?" I handed him a sealed envelope when he pulled away.

"Sure. What’s inside?" He tucked it into his wallet.

"Everything I’ve scheduled and what I need from her." I waved him off and picked up a pencil.

"Nathan and Cassandra will be here in thirty minutes to check on you and hang those pictures. It wouldn’t hurt to have a list ready for Cassandra too." His hand rested on the door handle.

"Already on it." I held up the paper.

Grayson winked and left. Five minutes later, a knock echoed at the office door.

###Chapter 0296

My desk was positioned too far from the door, so I had to get up to answer the knock. I knew Grayson always locked it when I was alone—shouting wouldn’t have done any good. Nathan had a key, which meant this was someone else entirely.

"Hello?" I said, blinking in surprise as I met the gaze of Grayson’s long-time ex-girlfriend, Victoria.

"Is Alpha Grayson here?" she asked, her eyes darting past me into the room.

"No. Is there something I can help you with?" I kept my stance firm, not moving aside just yet. Victoria had always intimidated me. She had held Grayson’s heart for years. He’d told me countless times he never saw her as a Luna, but that didn’t erase the love he once had for her. To her credit, she had never crossed any lines or tried to rekindle anything inappropriate.

"Can we talk for a moment?" Her gaze finally settled on mine, steady but uncertain.

"Sure." I stepped aside, letting her slip in. Her body language screamed discomfort—shoulders tense, fingers twisting together. I walked to Grayson’s desk and sat behind it, gesturing for her to take the seat opposite. The silence stretched awkwardly before I broke it. "What’s on your mind?"

"I’ve heard rumors that you’re planning major changes soon. With school ending, I’m not sure what my future holds. What I hoped for… didn’t happen." She looked down, her hands fidgeting in her lap. In that moment, I felt a pang of sympathy for her. None of this was her fault—but it wasn’t mine either.

"I am making several changes, yes," I confirmed, deliberately sidestepping her unspoken reference to Grayson. That was a topic I had no interest in revisiting.

"Would there be a job for me?" She lifted her eyes, a mix of shame and reluctant acceptance in them.

"A job?" I tilted my head, caught off guard.

"Yes. I need to find my purpose. Since you’re reshaping things, I was hoping I could be part of it."

"I have to ask—this isn’t an attempt to win Grayson back, is it?" The bluntness of my own question surprised me, but I held her gaze.

"Oh, no!" She looked genuinely horrified. "I won’t lie and say my heart wasn’t shattered when you two discovered you were fated. I still haven’t found my mate, but I’ve moved on. I just… can’t keep staring at my bedroom walls anymore. I’ve always wanted to work with kids. If you have anything like that, I’d love the chance."

I studied her, weighing the risks. Giving her an opportunity could be significant—but if she failed, the fallout would be just as big. Still, she hadn’t given me any reason to distrust her motives regarding Grayson. What tipped the scales was knowing he wouldn’t be directly involved in these projects. Aside from occasional check-ins, his focus was elsewhere.

"For obvious reasons, I can’t put you in a leadership role," I said finally. "But I’ll honor your request. These programs are designed to guide kids who need direction—I can’t turn away someone asking for the same thing. You’ll report directly to Mrs. Summers. She oversees daily activities for the children. Assist her wherever needed, and we’ll see how it goes. Promotions will depend on your performance. This setup also gives you flexibility to take classes next month—early childhood development, or whatever you feel is necessary. A degree is required for any management position in these programs."

I leaned back, watching her reaction. "For the rest of this month, you can help the kitchen staff. They’re stretched thin and could use extra hands."

Victoria exhaled, her shoulders relaxing slightly. "Thank you. I won’t let you down."

I nodded. "Prove it."

The door clicked shut behind her, leaving me alone with my thoughts. This could either be a disaster—or the fresh start she desperately needed. Only time would tell.

###Chapter 0297

Victoria looked crestfallen for a brief moment before quickly composing herself. "Thank you for this opportunity, Luna Audrey."

I couldn’t pinpoint why, but an uncomfortable weight settled in my chest. "I don’t hold any ill will toward you," I said carefully. "I know you’ve never crossed boundaries with Grayson since we mated, and I truly hope that doesn’t change. I understand your heart was broken, and for that, I’m deeply sorry. Grayson is my mate, and I won’t apologize for that, but I do hope you find peace."

"Me too," Victoria murmured. She stood abruptly. "May I be excused?"

"Of course. I’ll inform the kitchen staff that you’ll report to them tomorrow morning."

She gave a stiff nod and turned toward the door. Her entire body trembled as she reached for the handle—only for the door to swing open before she could touch it. Nathan nearly collided with her but stopped just in time.

"Victoria?" His brow furrowed as he glanced between her and me.

"Beta Nathan," she said tightly before brushing past him, her hurried footsteps fading down the hall.

Nathan and Cassandra stepped inside, both watching Victoria’s retreating figure with confusion. She was crying now, her shoulders shaking.

"What was that about?" Nathan asked, dropping into a chair with his usual ease. One thing I loved about him was how effortlessly he made me feel like part of their inner circle, even in private.

"She asked for a job," I explained.

"A job?" Cassandra echoed, settling beside Nathan.

"Yeah. Said she was ready to leave her room and be productive again. Mentioned hearing rumors about the Development and Rehabilitation Center."

Nathan rubbed his chin. "She did want to be a teacher at one point, didn’t she?"

"That’s what she said."

"Did you give her one?" Cassandra pressed.

"I did. Mrs. Margaret is overseeing the center. I told Victoria to report to her and assist however needed. Until then, she’ll help in the kitchen."

Cassandra nodded. "It’s absolute chaos down there."

"It is," I agreed. "Which is why I’m putting you in charge of it."

Cassandra’s eyes widened. "W-what?" She looked equal parts shocked and terrified. Nathan, however, slowly grinned.

"I’m drowning in work and need the help. The kitchen needs leadership—someone to reinstate the monthly meal schedules, plan event menus, oversee grocery orders, and manage storage."

"You want me to do that?" She pointed at herself, staring at me like I’d lost my mind.

"Yes, please. You’ve adapted so well, and I think it’s time you took on more responsibility. As capable as I am, I can’t do everything alone. Since you’re technically my beta, I’d like you to handle this."

"By myself?" Her jaw practically hit the floor.

"I’ll still be here for questions, and obviously, Nathan and Grayson are around. The kitchen staff has been here longer than I’ve been alive—my advice? Listen to what they want. You’re just the one organizing it."

###Chapter 0298

"Yes. I think you'll excel at this." I gave her an encouraging smile. "Why don't I help you organize while Nathan hangs my pictures?"

Relief washed over her face. "Thank you." Nathan flashed me a grateful grin as he stood.

"I marked the walls with pencil where I want each one." I told him. He nodded and got to work. "Let's move to my desk." I said, rolling Grayson's chair with me. "Sit beside me."

Cassandra settled in as I pulled out my laptop. Though I had a desktop, my laptop always felt better for creative work. "I don't even know where to begin..."

"Start here." I opened Excel and quickly designed a rectangle divided into seven sections—breakfast, lunch, and dinner lines. After copying and pasting, I had a full monthly calendar. I hit print, grabbed an empty three-ring binder and a pen. Once printed, I slid it toward Cassandra.

"Impressive." She murmured.

"It's just a template. You can customize it, but this works well for school cafeterias." Cassandra nodded. "Now, list each meal option. I'll use this first day as an example. Breakfast: pancakes with assorted fruits. Lunch: ham, chicken, or roast beef sandwiches, salads, fruits, and chips. Dinner: lasagna with garlic bread. Chocolate cake for dessert. Standard drinks—milk, water, tea. Anything else, they bring themselves."

"That seems manageable." Cassandra frowned slightly in concentration.

"It's not difficult. The next day, lunch could be hot ham and cheese or open-faced roast beef sandwiches."

"Oh! So you repurpose leftovers—ham into grilled cheese, roast beef into another sandwich. Leftover chicken could be shredded for tacos." Cassandra's eyes lit up.

"Exactly. Save cold cuts for pre-event days—less stress on staff. Dessert at dinner, but have cookies available for those craving sweets. Breakfast can have a hot option, but always stock muffins, instant oatmeal, fruit, and yogurt. Talk to the staff—they've done this for decades. Respect their input, but the final call is yours."

"This isn't as overwhelming as I thought." Cassandra absorbed everything.

"It's only as hard as you make it. Next, assign someone to handle grocery lists—most orders are bulk deliveries. Sebastian owns farmland for fresh produce. Reach out to Evelyn Andrews for additional supplies. Also, we have major events coming up—Prom, my Luna ceremony, and a global Halloween gathering. Thousands will attend, so we’ll need separate menus. For now, plan this month and next. Organize the kitchen, delegate tasks, and eliminate chaos."

"This week?" Cassandra blinked.

"Yes. You’ve got this." I squeezed her hand. "And remember—perfection isn’t the goal. Efficiency is."

She exhaled, determination replacing her earlier uncertainty. "Alright. Let’s do this."

Nathan chuckled from across the room, hammering a nail into place. "Teamwork makes the dream work."

I grinned. Exactly.

###Chapter 0299

"That's cutting it close." Cassandra's face tightened with stress.

"You'll be amazed how motivated the kitchen staff can be when properly inspired." I leaned back in my chair. "Things have a way of working out when everyone's on the same page. Head down there, ask Ms. Lucille when she can gather everyone for a meeting about kitchen organization. Use your mind-link—blast it out to the whole team. No excuses."

"Ms. Lucille is kind," Cassandra murmured, more to herself than to me.

"She is. Sneaked me extra desserts more times than I can count growing up." I grinned. "But you’ll need your own laptop. Use Nathan’s card to get one. Once this system’s in place, it’ll run itself. Then I can hand off more responsibilities to you."

"How do you manage all this?" Her eyes widened.

"Years of practice. I’ve built contacts, organized themes—look." I clicked open a folder labeled Event Concepts, filled with decor photos and inventory lists. "Most of this is stored in the basement. I buy strategically, reuse what I can." Another click revealed a contact list. "Sam handles lighting, Mia does floral arrangements—each has their specialty. I call, describe what I need, they send proposals. Simple."

"You could plan an entire gala in a day," she breathed, scrolling through the files.

"Done it before. Planned Grayson’s events for years. Now I do it for the whole pack."

"Okay. I’ll give it my best." Determination hardened her expression as she grabbed her bag and strode out without even glancing at Nathan.

"Never seen her like that," Nathan muttered, staring at the closed door.

"Hopefully, it helps her step into her role."

"Did Grayson put you up to this?" He hammered the last nail into the wall.

"Partly. He mentioned it today, but I’ve been swamped. Needed to delegate. I was waiting for her to ask, but Grayson thought she needed a push."

"She’s still hesitant after how those women treated her. But this? She can’t fail. It’ll build her confidence. Maybe finally let her breathe."

"She’s come so far already." I created an email account for Cassandra, jotting the details on a sticky note.

"Night and day difference. And thank the Moon those bastards are dead." Nathan’s knuckles whitened around the hammer.

A sharp knock interrupted us. Nathan set the tool down and answered. "Is Luna Audrey here? Urgent matter." He glanced at me. I nodded, and he stepped aside.

"Over here," I called as a nurse hurried in. I already knew why she’d come.

"Apologies for interrupting. Alpha Grayson didn’t specify where Vivienne and Xavier should be relocated. They’re at the hospital entrance, but we can’t discharge them without a secured location. His orders were clear—24/7 surveillance—" I raised a hand, cutting her off. I knew exactly what Grayson had demanded.

###Chapter 0300

"It's fine. They can stay in room..." I hesitated, unsure where to place them. Only two rooms were available—one on the Alpha floor, which was absolutely not an option right now. So, across the packhouse it was. "Room 2002. If they need any medical accommodations, let me know. You have my permission to do whatever is necessary."

"Thank you. We'll move them within the hour." I handed the nurse the key, and she left swiftly.

"I think I'm done here," Nathan said as soon as the door closed behind her.

"Okay." I glanced around. Everything was perfectly leveled, and I couldn't help but admire his skill. "She really was incredible."

"Grayson might not say it out loud, but this meant a lot to him. I'm glad you did this." Nathan wasn't looking at me but at the wolf head mounted behind his desk.

"Her absence left a void in this pack. I hope I can be the Luna she would’ve been."

"My father always said she was extraordinary. The centers you're setting up? She would’ve loved them. I think she’d be proud of you." My eyes welled up. Maybe it was the pregnancy hormones, but his words struck deep. That was the highest praise I could’ve asked for.

"Thank you."

"So, what’s next?" Nathan smoothly changed the subject.

"Give it some time, then go see Vivienne." I sighed, sinking into a chair. We hadn’t told anyone about the pregnancy yet. Right now, I was holding up well, but I wasn’t sure how much longer that would last.

"Do you want me to come with you?" Nathan offered.

I shook my head. "I need to handle this on my own. Vivienne has been my role model for years. I want to face her as an equal, not hide behind someone else."

Nathan smirked. "Fair enough. But call me if you need backup. This is one of those moments where you might want a witness."

"I’ll manage," I said firmly. "But I’ll call if things get out of hand."

He chuckled. "Just don’t throw the first punch unless absolutely necessary."

I rolled my eyes. "If I punch Sebastian, it’ll be justified."

Nathan laughed outright. "Oh, I’d pay to see that."

Despite the tension, I smiled. Nathan had been far from perfect, but he was trying. And right now, that was enough.

"I’ll be around. Gonna check in with Cassandra first. Let me know if you need anything." He nodded and headed out.

Alone again, I opened my browser and pulled up a baby supplies site. Grayson and I had already picked a theme, but I wanted something different. Evelyn’s nursery had been floral—beautiful, but the overwhelming pink wasn’t my style. If we had a boy, I was leaning toward an outdoor theme—wolves, forests, the works.

I found the cutest wolf-shaped pacifier clips. Most items came in pink, blue, green, or white. Opting for green, it would suit either gender. After selecting a few matching blankets, I realized an hour had slipped by.

If I wanted to visit Vivienne before changing for dinner, I needed to move. Closing my laptop, I stood and headed upstairs to our room.

###Chapter 0301

"What should I wear to a baby shower?" I murmured to myself, staring at my closet. A sundress seemed like the safest option, though I wasn't sure if the event would be indoors or outside.

Werewolf pregnancies were unpredictable. Evelyn carried alpha blood, so hers would progress faster than most. But since I was also an alpha carrying Grayson's child, I worried mine might be even quicker.

The bedroom door swung open. "There you are!" Grayson strode in, his face lit up with a grin. He leaned in and pressed a kiss to my cheek.

"Just trying to decide what to wear," I said, pulling out a floral blue-and-white dress. "I didn’t expect you back so early."

"Scarlett left early to finish some things for Sophia’s shower," he explained while I slipped into the dress and touched up my makeup.

"How is she doing?"

"Great. No negative symptoms—just craving pickles."

I laughed. "So there’s hope I won’t be an emotional wreck like Sophia was."

"She was a disaster," Grayson agreed, pulling on khaki shorts and a teal polo.

"I want to check on Vivienne before we leave," I said, catching his gaze in the mirror.

He paused mid-motion, his expression shifting subtly before he nodded. "Okay."

I finished applying my lip gloss and packed the baby gift—a gray bobby pillow with white stars, matching the gender-neutral theme. The tissue paper was crisp white, tucked into a bag filled with tiny baby essentials.

"Nathan and Cassandra are riding with us," Grayson said as he slipped on his shoes.

"Makes sense. No need for separate cars."

He grabbed the gift bag and opened the door. "How are you feeling?"

"Same as before. Just need to sit down soon, but otherwise fine."

As we stepped into the hall, Grayson locked the door behind us. "We should tell everyone soon," he said, taking my hand.

"Prom is this weekend. Let’s announce it there."

"Why then?"

I switched to the mind-link as we descended the stairs, not wanting to be overheard. "Everyone will be there, and we won’t be stealing anyone’s moment."

At the bottom, Grayson set the bag by the door, his demeanor shifting as we approached Vivienne’s room. His posture straightened—Alpha mode activated, protective and alert behind me.

I raised my hand to knock but hesitated.

Three weak taps later, the door opened.

"Alpha Grayson, Luna Audrey," the nurse greeted, stepping aside to let us in.

Xavier stood in the corner, silent, while Vivienne lay in bed, her bandages being changed.

"Oh, hello!" she said weakly, glancing down at herself self-consciously.

###Chapter 0302

"We... we just wanted to check on you." The nurse stepped inside, closing the door behind her before continuing to change the bandages. Vivienne's front was modestly covered, but her back was completely exposed. It was the first time I truly saw how battered and fragile her body was.

"Thank you for visiting," Vivienne murmured, wincing as the nurse applied something to her wounds.

"How are you feeling?" I asked, though my voice sounded distant even to my own ears. My heart remained steady only because Grayson kept flooding me with calming emotions.

"Much better," she replied softly. "The doctor has me on an 800-calorie diet. Next week, we'll increase it to 1200. He says we have to take it slow so my stomach can adjust. But I can already feel myself getting stronger every day."

The nurse finished wrapping the last of the wounds before carefully pulling Vivienne's nightgown back down. She helped her settle onto the bed, tucking the blankets around her before moving to clean up.

The room, though smaller than the hospital, was still spacious and far more comfortable. A king-sized bed dominated the right side, while a cozy seating area occupied the left. The walk-in closet led to a private bathroom, stocked with everything they might need.

"I'd like to get you some clothes and personal items," I said, trying to fill the silence. "Make a list of whatever you need—sizes, preferences—and I'll take care of it. The bathroom is already stocked with essentials for both of you."

The whole exchange felt stiff. I didn’t know what else to say, and they just kept staring at me.

"The nurse mentioned I might be able to walk around soon," Vivienne said, offering a small smile. "Maybe even eat in the cafeteria this week."

"That would be great progress," I agreed.

"Any movement will help," the nurse chimed in, giving Vivienne a pointed look. "Lying in bed all day isn’t ideal, but don’t push yourself too hard either. The physical wounds are healing. Now it’s about rebuilding your strength." She peeled off her gloves and washed her hands in the bathroom.

"Xavier starts training tomorrow," Vivienne said, glancing at him. "I thought I might try walking to the porch, just to get some fresh air."

"Sounds like a good plan," Xavier replied, his expression softening slightly.

"Well, we have an event to attend," I said, eager to leave. "I just wanted to make sure you were settling in."

"I’ll make a list tonight," Vivienne promised. "It won’t be much—just the basics."

"Same goes for you, Xavier," I added firmly. "You’ll need more clothes. Write down your sizes."

He didn’t respond, just nodded. Pride, no doubt.

"Thank you for stopping by," Vivienne said warmly. "Maybe I’ll see you around this week while I’m up and about."

"Maybe," I replied, turning toward the door. Grayson opened it before I could, and I didn’t slow down as it clicked shut behind me.

"Audrey." Grayson caught up in a few strides, his hand closing around my arm. I turned into him without thinking, my body folding against his. "It’s okay."

"I don’t know why this is so hard," I admitted, a quiet sob escaping. Not enough to break me—just enough to release the pressure.

"You’re handling it better than you think," he murmured, arms tightening around me.

"Logically, I know they didn’t abandon me."

"But you spent nineteen years believing they did. That kind of pain doesn’t vanish in two weeks."

"Evelyn would’ve moved on by now."

"You’re not Evelyn." Grayson pulled back slightly, his gaze steady. "Audrey, Evelyn wasn’t as put together as you imagine. She was broken inside—Annette’s abuse, the constant hits… She only looked strong on the outside. Trust me, you can’t compare yourself to her."

###Chapter 0303

"Are—" Nathan rounded the corner and froze when he realized he'd interrupted us.

"We're ready," I said, turning away before Grayson could respond. His frown told me he wasn't happy with my answer, but he didn't argue.

"O-okay…" Nathan shot Grayson a questioning look, which I ignored as I moved to grab our gift. Cassandra must have seen the whole exchange because she didn't ask. Instead, she wordlessly picked up their present and strode ahead of me to Grayson's car.

The trunk popped open, and we placed the gifts inside before shutting it and climbing in. Grayson reached the car just as I slid into my seat, slamming my door shut with more force than necessary before circling to the driver's side. I knew he was frustrated, but I didn’t care.

"Cassandra, how did the meeting go?" I asked as Grayson started the engine.

"It's scheduled for tomorrow, but I spoke with the so-called 'head' of the kitchen," she said, making air quotes. Grayson pulled onto the road, his grip tight on the wheel.

"What did they say?"

"They loved the idea of restarting the monthly menu. They already had recipes picked out. Honestly, they barely needed me—just set everything themselves." Her tone carried a hint of irritation.

"So, productive," I concluded.

"Shockingly, things get done when you ask for opinions and people actually run with them."

"Definitely makes life easier," I agreed.

Grayson's hand settled on my thigh, squeezing lightly. He was still tense, but at least he wasn’t refusing to touch me.

"Since that was handled so quickly, maybe you're ready for another task?" Nathan draped an arm around Cassandra, who glanced up at him. There was still hesitation in her eyes, but more confidence than before.

"What else would you like her to do, Audrey?" Nathan asked me.

As much as I wanted her to handle Vivienne and Xavier’s lists, I couldn’t dump something that personal on her yet.

"We have the big pack meeting Friday, but we should check with Evelyn about prom prep for Saturday. It’s at the conference center Sebastian built. I have more, but we can wait until after Saturday to discuss." Mostly because she didn’t know I was pregnant yet, and we weren’t telling anyone.

"Okay," Cassandra said simply as we pulled into Silvercrest Pack territory.

People moved about as usual, but today, the air was lighter—almost carefree. I couldn’t help but smile as we stepped out of the car.

Grayson’s arm slid around my waist, pulling me close just as Sebastian emerged from the packhouse. "Hey, man," Grayson greeted, extending a hand.

"How’s it going?" Sebastian gave his usual small smile, shaking Grayson’s hand before they pulled into a brief hug. "Audrey, you look stunning," he murmured before pressing a kiss to my cheek.

"Thank you," I said, slightly taken aback. He never greeted me first. But then again, we weren’t exactly in peacetime.

"Sebastian!" Nathan beamed.

"Grayson! Audrey!" Evelyn’s voice rang out as she bounded down the stairs. Sebastian barely had time to react before she was upon us.

"Hello, Cassandra," Sebastian said warmly.

"Hello, Alpha Sebastian," she replied, her timid demeanor returning.

"How are you feeling?" Grayson asked Evelyn as they embraced.

"I told you earlier—I’m fine," she huffed, rolling her eyes before turning to me. "That dress is gorgeous on you!"

"Thank you!" Evelyn wore a flowing white sundress dotted with sunflowers. I swore I’d seen it before, but I couldn’t place where. "I love yours too."

###Chapter 0304

"It's a gown." Evelyn shrugged before continuing. "Nathan." She scooped her up and spun her once before setting her down. My eyes instinctively darted to Sebastian whenever Nathan did that. A flicker of irritation crossed his face, but I could tell he'd learned to tolerate it by now.

What surprised me was Cassandra actually returning Evelyn's hug. Not that she had much choice, but it was still heartwarming to witness. "Where's Sophia?" I asked.

Evelyn's body stiffened slightly. "Ssssshe'll meet us at the celebration."

Sebastian tilted his head skyward and exhaled loudly. "That doesn't bode well," Grayson remarked.

"Apparently, she demanded golden balloons and they're all violet," Evelyn placed her hands on her hips. "I'd love to chat, but I need to fix whatever meltdown she's having now."

"Need assistance?" I offered.

"That would be incredible." Relief washed over Evelyn's face as she smiled at me.

"Absolutely. Cassandra and I will help sort this out." I seized Cassandra's hand, dragging her along with us.

"While the balloons are the surface issue, she's really panicking about motherhood in general," Evelyn confessed as we circled the packhouse toward the rear. A massive white tent stood erected, adorned with elaborate decorations and clusters of balloons. Some shaped like baby bottles and pacifiers, others simple spheres. My favorite were the towering seven-foot balloons anchored by cascades of confetti—except they were all violet.

"It's terrifying," Cassandra murmured. We both caught the tremor in her voice, but Evelyn was too perceptive to call attention to it. Instead, she offered an understanding nod as we reached the venue.

"Oh, Luna!" A disheveled pack member rushed toward Evelyn, strands of hair sticking out wildly. "We need you!"

"What happened?" Evelyn frowned.

"She hates the cake! I barely snatched it away before she destroyed it!" The girl's eyes brimmed with tears.

"Damn it. Where is she?"

"Locked in the bathroom! We had to remove the centerpieces and now everything's ruined!"

"I can handle the decorations if you want to deal with her?" Cassandra volunteered unexpectedly.

Evelyn blinked rapidly before recovering. "That would be perfect. Trust your instincts—whatever you choose will be wonderful."

I gave her an encouraging smile as we entered. Oliver was slumped against the bathroom door, exhaustion etched into his features. "Open up or I'm breaking it down!"

"Oliver, why don't you join the guys? We'll take care of this," I suggested, pulling him aside. Knowing Evelyn, she wouldn't wait for permission before demolishing that door.

Oliver just threw his hands up and stalked away. "Three seconds, then this door comes down," Evelyn declared with alpha authority.

The door flew open. Sophia stood there in a stunning golden sheath dress—high-necked, sleeveless, hugging every curve. Her makeup was streaked from crying, though her hair cascaded beautifully down her back.

"What's the crisis?" Evelyn half-shouted as we entered. Closing the door, she grabbed a towel and began wiping Sophia's face.

"Nothing matches! I wanted golden balloons and cake, but it's all violet!" I couldn't suppress my laughter.

###Chapter 0305

"You're mocking me?" Sophia's eyes flashed with anger as Oliver gave me that 'you've lost your mind' look.

"Are you hearing yourself right now?" I choked back another laugh. "Two weeks ago, Sebastian was abducted and nearly killed. Your damn mate almost died! He's still limping from his injuries, and you're crying over balloon colors? Maybe try being grateful he's alive to see this party at all!"

The words exploded from me before I could stop them. Slamming the door behind me, I stormed out before my temper could worsen.

My feet carried me blindly through the halls, my anger cooling into mortification with each step.

"Audrey?" Grayson's voice cut through my thoughts.

All the guys stood frozen in the foyer, staring at me like I'd grown a second head.

"What happened?" Grayson asked cautiously. Nathan was studying the ceiling while the others exchanged confused glances.

"I might have... yelled at Sophia," I admitted in a small voice, cheeks burning.

"You what?" Grayson's jaw dropped. Oliver burst into laughter.

"Care to explain?" Sebastian looked between us.

"She was having a meltdown because her dress didn't match the decorations. I may have pointed out her priorities were screwed up when her mate nearly died recently." I swallowed hard. "I suggested she should just be happy to be celebrating this pregnancy at all."

"Well, guess we'll die together," Oliver chuckled.

"No one's dying today," Sebastian sighed.

"I'm shocked you said anything," Nathan remarked, eyes narrowing. "You're usually so reserved."

"Piss off." The words slipped out before I could stop them. My hands flew to my mouth as the guys erupted in laughter - all except Grayson, who looked utterly stunned.

"What's so funny?" Sebastian's voice cut through the noise as he entered with Sophia in tow.

When no one answered, he nudged Sophia forward. "I want to apologize. Pregnancy hormones are no excuse." She looked genuinely remorseful as Oliver pulled her into a hug.

"We're all ready for this pregnancy to be over," Sebastian muttered, arms crossed.

"Should we start the party?" I suggested quickly, desperate to move past my outburst.

"Best idea I've heard all day," Sebastian agreed, pushing Nathan and Grayson toward the doors. Grayson's arm slipped around my waist as we stepped outside.

"That was actually kind of hot," he mind-linked me.

"Guess I'm getting feisty. At least I'm not crying over color schemes," I replied as we ducked under the party tent. The space buzzed with pack members enjoying drinks and appetizers.

"Everyone, help yourselves!" Sebastian announced before disappearing into the crowd. My stomach growled as I spotted Cassandra arranging the final floral centerpieces.

"These look amazing," I complimented her.

"Thank you, I—"

"C-Cassandra?" A woman's voice interrupted. The resemblance between them was uncanny - same hazel eyes, same heart-shaped face. When Cassandra didn't respond, I turned to see her frozen in shock, hands trembling.

"What's going on?" Nathan appeared behind us.

"Excuse me, who are you?" I asked gently.

The woman smiled. "I'm her sister."

Cassandra looked like she'd seen a ghost.

###Chapter 0306

"Sebastian, let's take this to your office." I said urgently. The playful glint in his eyes vanished instantly. This was the beta Grayson had been searching for.

"Move." Nathan commanded the woman sharply. She nodded and began walking. Glancing around, I realized no one had noticed our little exchange. Quietly, I approached Sebastian and tapped his shoulder. Evelyn was engrossed in conversation on the other side of the tent, while Grayson was loading up a plate with food.

"Yeah?" Sebastian turned, his gaze questioning.

"Follow me." I whispered, barely audible, before turning away. We slipped out unnoticed—Oliver was busy helping Sophia with something.

"What's going on?" Sebastian demanded the moment we were out of earshot.

"I'm not entirely sure. But we need to get to your office now." I quickened my pace.

Thankfully, his office wasn’t far, and the door was already ajar. "What the hell?" Sebastian’s irritation flared as he stepped inside, his aura prickling the air. "Explain this."

Nathan was restraining Cassandra, who looked both terrified and furious. The woman leaning against the far wall smirked. "After all these years," she mused.

"Apparently, they're sisters," I told Sebastian.

His entire body tensed as his eyes darted between them. "Close the door," he ordered me before stepping between the two women.

I obeyed, shutting the door firmly before moving to stand beside Cassandra.

"Tell them, little Cass," the woman taunted, crossing her arms. Cassandra remained silent, her jaw clenched. "Cat got your tongue?"

"Enough!" Sebastian’s voice was dangerously calm. "Explain. Now."

"I'm Cassandra’s older sister. Seraphina."

Nathan’s expression darkened. "No..."

"She told you about me?" Seraphina looked almost pleased. "She should be thanking me. I kept her alive in that hellhole!"

"Alive?" Cassandra’s voice cracked. "You sold me to pay off your debts! I was raped by countless men because of you!" My stomach twisted at her words. Cassandra had never shared her past with anyone—except, it seemed, Nathan.

"I did what I had to! If I hadn’t, it would’ve been worse for both of us." Seraphina narrowed her eyes.

"You sick b*tch! You told your mate to rape me—and then you watched!" Cassandra was shaking now, her grief turning to fury. Then, like a switch flipping, she went still. "Where’s Magnus?"

A slow, knowing smile curled Seraphina’s lips. "No idea."

"Who is Magnus?" Sebastian asked through gritted teeth.

"Our brother. The gamma," Cassandra answered.

"Your brother was the gamma?" Sebastian’s eyes darkened.

"Yes. Seraphina’s mate, Raphael, was his best friend. They controlled the warriors. If someone needed disciplining, they handled it—unless Damian was bored. And Seraphina let it all happen."

Sebastian strode forward, yanking Seraphina’s collar down. The mating mark was still fresh—her mate was alive. "Where is he?"

"Honestly? No clue. He and Magnus escaped before your raid."

"What are they planning?"

"Revenge." Seraphina smirked, lifting her chin.

My blood ran cold. "What?"

"That’s right, Audrey. You took something they want back." Her gaze locked onto me, mocking.

"Sebastian, lock her up for now. Nathan, stay here with Cassandra. Collect yourselves before rejoining the party. Nothing else ruins today. We’ll deal with this tonight."

Sebastian barely had to nod before three massive warriors appeared at the door. "Take her to holding cell five."

###Chapter 0307

"Five?" The warrior's eyebrows shot up in disbelief.

"Exactly." Sebastian pushed her toward them. She went willingly, laughter bubbling from her lips the entire way.

The moment she left the office, I waited just a beat longer, ensuring she was truly gone before speaking again. "Nathan," I said, my voice low but firm, "you know better than to breathe a word of this to anyone right now."

Cassandra's face was buried in his chest. His jaw clenched, fury simmering beneath the surface, but he kept his composure. "Yeah," he muttered. With a nod, we stepped out of the office and shut the door behind us.

"Audrey—" Sebastian started, but I wasn't in the mood to hear it. I kept walking, my strides sharp and purposeful. He followed me all the way back to the party. Grayson and Evelyn both narrowed their eyes as we approached, but otherwise, we went unnoticed. Their identical expressions of suspicion were uncanny—twin instincts kicking in.

What the hell is happening? Grayson's voice echoed through our mind-link. I walked straight to him and sank onto his lap, pressing my forehead against his neck, seeking comfort in his familiar scent.

Later, I replied. After a few steadying breaths, I straightened and watched Sophia finish unwrapping her gifts. Sebastian and Evelyn kept exchanging glances, their silent conversation obvious. Grayson didn't push, but his hand rubbed soothing circles on my back, grounding me.

My body moved on autopilot as Sophia cut the cake and slices were passed around. Grayson tried to coax me into eating, but I just shook my head and pushed the plate away. We had just found happiness—and now it was slipping through our fingers. This time, it wasn’t just about us. Babies were involved. The stakes had never been higher.

Cassandra never returned to the party.

Only when the festivities began winding down did Sophia finally yawn.

"Let's get you upstairs for a nap," Oliver said, helping her stand.

"This is my sacred nap time. Ask Scarlett—I'm unbearable without it," she joked.

"Yeah, that’s the only time," Evelyn rolled her eyes but smiled. "Oliver, come find me after you’ve settled her. We need help cleaning up."

Oliver narrowed his eyes at her, though Sophia seemed oblivious. "Fine."

The moment they were out of sight, Evelyn turned on us. "Someone better start talking," she demanded, arms crossed.

Sebastian looked at me, mirroring her stance.

"Not here," I said, standing abruptly.

"Audrey, what happened?" Grayson gently turned my face toward his. The tears I’d been holding back threatened to spill, but anger surged just as quickly.

"No!" I jerked out of his grasp and stood, forcing myself to breathe. "I said not here." My gaze flickered around—pack members were still milling about, clearing tables.

"My office," Sebastian said, rising to his feet.

"But—" Evelyn started.

"Now, Evelyn," he cut in, giving her a look that silenced her instantly. Her eyes darted to me, worry creasing her brow.

"Fine."

We moved as a unit—no hand-holding, no comforting touches. Grayson didn’t try to take my hand, and honestly, I was too wound up to accept it anyway. Fear, anxiety, sorrow, guilt—they all churned inside me like a storm. I didn’t even know how to begin explaining what Cassandra had revealed.

The office was thick with tension when we entered. Nathan and Cassandra were still on the couch. Her face was splotchy, eyes red-rimmed—she’d been crying hard.

"What the hell is going on, Nathan?" Sebastian demanded, studying Cassandra’s state.

"You need to tell them," Nathan said, his voice eerily calm despite the blackness swirling in his eyes.

"I—I can’t," Cassandra whispered, barely audible.

"We don’t have a choice," Nathan insisted. "We kept your secrets when they didn’t matter. But now they do. Now you have to tell them what you told me."

Cassandra looked at me, desperation in her gaze.

"Someone better start talking," Evelyn snapped, impatience sharpening her tone.

"This isn’t over," I said, locking eyes with Grayson.

The weight of those words hung heavy in the air.

###Chapter 0308

"What's not over?" Grayson demanded, his voice sharp.

"The war," I replied, holding his gaze without flinching.

"It is over," Evelyn snapped, though the tension in her jaw betrayed her calm tone. "I killed them myself—I tore Dominic's heart out with my bare hands. And Scarlett took down Damian." Her fingers twitched at her sides, and Sebastian watched her carefully.

Grayson's eyes flicked between us before landing on Cassandra. "Explain."

"Sebastian has a pack member," I started, glancing at Cassandra. She remained silent, tears streaking down her face. "Her name is Seraphina. She's Cassandra's older sister. From what we've gathered, Seraphina is mated to Raphael. They have an older brother, Magnus—he was the gamma. According to Seraphina, Raphael and Magnus escaped before you attacked the building. Now they want revenge."

"On who?" Grayson asked after a beat.

"She said I took something from them, and they want it back." My throat tightened. "I don't know if it's the Alpha title or if they blame me for their losses. But she looked right at me and said it."

"She's in my holding cells," Sebastian said, finally tearing his gaze from Evelyn to look at Grayson. "Waiting for your orders."

Grayson blinked, his expression unreadable. His eyes darted to Cassandra, then back to me, before settling on Evelyn. She was staring at the floor, her fingers clenched into fists.

With a sudden roar, Grayson slammed his fist into the wall. No one moved to stop him. The sound of his rage filled the room, raw and unfiltered.



"I want to talk to her," he growled finally.

"Whenever you're ready," Sebastian replied evenly.

"I'm going too," I said, my voice steadier than I expected.

"The hell you are!" Grayson whirled on me, shouting. He'd never raised his voice at me before. The shock of it made me stiffen—but more than that, it pissed me off.

"Whoa!" Evelyn stepped between us.

"I am going, Grayson!" I snapped from behind her. "This is my life, and if it's in danger, I deserve to know!"

"You're pregnant!" he shouted back. "It's not just your life anymore!"

The air left the room. Grayson froze, realizing his mistake, and closed his eyes as if trying to reel himself back in.

"You're pregnant?" Evelyn turned to me, her eyes wide.

"This wasn't how we planned to tell you," I muttered, my shoulders sagging. Disappointment curled in my chest.

Evelyn pulled me into a tight hug. "I'm so happy for you. How far along?"

"About the same as you, I think. I just found out yesterday."

Silence settled over the room as everyone processed the news.

"A-Alpha," Cassandra spoke up, standing. Grayson didn't respond, but his gaze shifted to her. "Seraphina would sell me out without hesitation. She wasn't like the rest of us—she wasn't abused. She whispered in Raphael's ear, stayed in the shadows. She's not innocent. I was never involved, and I don't know anything useful. I'd be scrubbing floors when she'd come home, screaming at Raphael that he wasn't doing what she wanted. The second she saw me, she'd hit me and send me away. I swear, I don't—"

Grayson shoved the door open and stormed out.

"Evelyn, I'm coming," I said, hoping she'd back me up.

She exchanged a look with Sebastian. "You stay in the observation room," she told me firmly.

"Fine."

She grabbed my arm and pulled me out of the office, Sebastian right behind us. Oliver intercepted us in the hall, confusion flashing across his face—but one look at Grayson's expression made him hold his tongue. Nathan emerged from the office and shut the door before following us.

###Chapter 0309

The cells were nothing like I had imagined.

The stench hit me first—a thick, suffocating mix of sweat and decay that had festered in the stagnant air. It burned my nostrils, making my eyes water instantly. I gagged, my throat tightening as the scent of blood and filth layered over it.

Then came the prisoners.

Chained to the walls, some barely conscious, others reaching through the bars with desperate, clawing hands. Their hollow eyes followed us as we passed.

"Don't look," Evelyn murmured, gripping my arm and pulling me faster down the corridor.

Grayson was barking orders at the guards, demanding Seraphina be brought out. Before I could process more, Evelyn shoved me into a dark room.

The door slammed shut, muting the worst of the stench, but the oppressive air remained.

Blind in the pitch black, I blinked rapidly until a harsh fluorescent light flickered on.

To my right, a large glass window revealed the scene beyond.

Sebastian and Grayson had stripped off their shirts, their muscles tense as they wrestled Seraphina into a chair. She fought like a wild animal—biting, kicking, snarling—until Grayson landed a brutal punch to her jaw.

She slumped, dazed.

Nathan and Oliver stood guard by the door, their expressions grim.

"Why are they shirtless?" I whispered.

"So they don't ruin their clothes," Evelyn answered flatly. She pressed a button, and the room filled with the sound of their voices.

My stomach twisted.

"You will answer every question we ask," Sebastian commanded, his voice like ice.

Seraphina smirked, blood trickling from her split lip. "Do I have to? I never swore loyalty to your pack. I'm not bound by your rules."

Grayson didn't hesitate. His fist cracked against her mouth again. "Tell me what your mate is planning."

Rage rolled off him in waves.

"I only know they escaped before Alpha Damian died," she spat, then laughed. "Stupid bastard."

I glanced at Evelyn, but she didn't react.

Sebastian leaned in, his voice dripping with disdain. "From where I stand, Damian was a failure. Couldn’t even find the traitor in his own ranks. Pathetic."

Seraphina's eyes flashed. "He was ten times the Alpha you'll ever be."

Grayson scoffed. "Sounds like you cared about him. Did you spread your legs for him too?"

"I did what was necessary for Raphael," she hissed. "He is a man of honor!"

Grayson held up a hand, stopping Nathan mid-step. Then he stalked forward. "Honorable? He raped your sister. You call that honor?"

"She was just business," Seraphina sneered. "Frankly, I'm surprised the little bitch survived as long as she did."

CRACK.

Grayson backhanded her so hard I heard her neck snap.

Sebastian hadn't moved. "What position did Magnus want? He was already Gamma."

Seraphina grinned through bloody teeth. "Not my story to tell." Then her gaze flickered with amusement. "Though I was surprised to see Cassandra."

Sebastian's jaw tightened. "Explain."

"I sent payment to some men a while back. They were supposed to handle her."

My breath caught.

"That was the night Nathan found her," I whispered. "Your birthday party. Did Grayson and Sebastian kill those men?"

Evelyn only frowned.

"She found her mate that night," Grayson said, echoing my thoughts.

Seraphina laughed. "Who would want someone so used up?"

Nathan lunged.

Grayson didn't stop him—not until Nathan's fist connected with her temple. Then he yanked him back. "We need her alive."

Sebastian moved fast, slamming Nathan against the wall by his throat. Oliver, still healing, couldn't intervene.

Grayson turned back to Seraphina, his voice deadly calm.

"Let's try this again."

###Chapter 0310

"What does Audrey have to do with this?" Grayson demanded as Seraphina lifted her head weakly.

"Everything. An eye for an eye." Seraphina whispered before collapsing. Her shallow breathing confirmed she wasn't dead, but icy dread coiled in my stomach.

New guards flooded the room while Grayson roughly grabbed his and Sebastian's shirts. Nathan followed behind Oliver who held the door as Grayson stormed out after Sebastian, his fury palpable.

"Are you alright?" Evelyn asked when we emerged from the cells. Our group formed a tight circle in the corridor.

"An eye for an eye? They must think Cassandra is dead. So this is really about me?" My voice trembled.

"Sounds like someone's skeletons are tumbling out of the closet." Oliver remarked dryly.

"What are you implying?" Grayson's eyes narrowed. "Xavier?"

"Exactly. What did Xavier do to protect his daughter that's making Raphael and Magnus want her dead?" Oliver's gaze locked onto me, his brow furrowed.

"Evelyn, keep her here." Grayson ordered, slapping Sebastian's chest before striding away. After exchanging a glance with Evelyn, Sebastian followed.

I opened my mouth to protest but no words came. Instead, I channeled all my hurt toward Grayson's retreating form. He was too consumed by rage to notice.

"Come on, let's go inside." Evelyn linked her arm through mine.

"Why can't I question him? He's my father!" I spat, frustration boiling over.



"Because you're carrying his grandchild - that changes everything. What if you got knocked over and lost the baby?" Oliver interjected.

"Do you hear how ridiculous you sound? Men can pound into us repeatedly without harming the baby, but oh no, let's worry about me tripping!"

Evelyn burst into laughter while the guys just shook their heads. "I love pregnant Audrey."

"Seriously! Don't you realize you'd hit the baby's head before anything else?" My exasperation spilled out, making Oliver and Nathan stare at me like I'd grown horns.

"What?" Nathan blinked rapidly.

"Please tell me I don't have to give you a basic anatomy lesson?"

"Oh!" Evelyn gasped between giggles. "Please do!"

"Might need to draw them a damn diagram." I muttered, storming down the hallway.

"Pregnant Audrey is vicious." Oliver teased as I passed.

I flipped him off without breaking stride, earning his delighted chuckle. I wasn't sure where I was going, just needed to move. The question burned in my mind - what had Xavier done to make Lorenzo and Magnus target me?

Somehow I found myself back at Evelyn and Sebastian's office. Cassandra sat dozing in a chair when we entered. I collapsed into an armchair while Nathan settled beside Cassandra and Oliver took the seat next to me. Evelyn sank into Sebastian's chair.

"There hasn't actually been any direct threat against me. It's been two weeks and nothing's happened."

"They lost everything. Rebuilding takes time. Two men can't just waltz into a pack and kill someone." Oliver scoffed.

"Why not? Seraphina apparently did." My voice was flat, expression unreadable.

"What?" Oliver's head snapped up.

"Didn't you hear her? She wasn't at the meeting. Not present when Nathan and Cassandra were introduced. Not there when we demolished the packhouse. I'd bet my life she slipped in unnoticed to see how far she could get."

###Chapter 0311
Grayson POV

My blood was on fire.

We had just buried our dead. My father. Opened Evelyn's shop. The club was set to open Friday. Evelyn was pregnant. Sophia was pregnant and nearly lost Oliver. And now Audrey—my mate—was carrying my child while her life hung in the balance?

I didn’t lift my foot from the gas the entire drive to the packhouse. Leaving the pack today hadn’t even crossed my mind. This entire situation made me sick. How Sebastian kept his temper in check was beyond me. Evelyn was my sister, and I was furious—but Audrey was my mate. That changed everything.

"We don’t even know if this is true. Let’s talk to Xavier, get the facts, and make a plan. There are only two of them." Sebastian was trying to reason with me, but I wasn’t in the mood to listen.

"Bring Xavier to my office. Now!" I barked at the warrior guarding Vivienne and Xavier’s room.

"Yes, Alpha," he responded through the mind-link.

The gates barely had time to open before I roared through them. Gravel sprayed as I slammed on the brakes, skidding around the center floral display before parking haphazardly. Sebastian managed to exit first, staying a step ahead as we stormed inside.

I barely registered the pack members scattering, the warriors stiffening, ready for a fight.

"Grayson." Sebastian stopped in front of my office door and had the nerve to press a hand to my chest, halting me. Neither of us had bothered with shirts yet, so my fury was on full display. "Don’t go in there like this."

"How the hell did you stay calm when Evelyn was taken?" I snarled.

"By knowing the only way to get her back was to play it right. If you go in there hot-headed, you’ll ruin everything. You don’t want to know what I did when we got her back." A dark smirk tugged at his lips.

I turned away, scowling. I didn’t want to think about what he’d done to my sister. "She wasn’t pregnant then," I muttered.

"Exactly. You have an unborn child at stake. Make the right move." His voice was so low I almost missed it. He didn’t wait for a response before opening the door.

"Grayson? Uh—Alpha Grayson. Why was I dragged in here like I did something wrong?" Xavier’s irritation was barely concealed.

"Cut the crap and talk," I snapped, striding to stand behind my desk. Sebastian remained by the door.

Xavier glanced around, eyes darting to the windows.

"They’re bulletproof. You can’t jump through them. Don’t even think about it." I watched him like a predator would a trapped animal.

"Then tell me why I’m here," he demanded.

"Watch your tone." My voice dropped dangerously before I sat, trying to show I wasn’t here to attack—yet.

Confusion flickered across his face, but he stayed standing. "Did something happen? Is Audrey okay?"

"Audrey’s fine. I want to know what you know about Raphael and Magnus."

"Raphael and Magnus? Why?"

"They weren’t among the dead."

Xavier’s gaze snapped between me and Sebastian. "What do you mean they weren’t killed?"

"They slipped out before we got there. They’re still alive. Out there somewhere." I studied his reaction.

Xavier sank into an armchair, staring at the ground. "Who told you that?"

"Seraphina."

His head jerked up. "Seraphina is alive? I thought I killed her."

###Chapter 0312

"What the hell is happening here?" I leaned forward, my voice sharp with tension.

"Magnus was the gamma and ten times worse than Dominic. He makes Dominic look like a child. He literally killed a girl by suffocating her during... well, you get the idea. Raphael isn’t much better, but he didn’t have the same influence Magnus did. Seraphina? Just as twisted. Part of me wonders if she was Damian’s daughter. But if she was, he didn’t give a damn—just tossed her into that hellhole with the rest of them."

Sebastian let out a dark chuckle. "This just keeps getting better."

"I think Seraphina was the one pulling the strings. The others were idiots, but she wasn’t. If you caught her, there’s a reason. Where’s Audrey?"

My eyes locked onto Sebastian’s. He was out the door before I could even speak. "Keep talking," I forced out through gritted teeth.

"What did she say?"

"Only that it was an eye for an eye."

Xavier stood abruptly and began pacing. "None of this makes sense. If Seraphina survived, why come after Audrey?"

"Was she pregnant when you attacked her?"

"How the hell should I know?"

"Would the baby have been Raphael’s or Magnus’s?"

Xavier froze. "Meaning she lost Magnus’s potential heir? And now he wants revenge by taking Audrey’s future children?" He scoffed. "Why are we even talking about Audrey? Evelyn was the one who killed them."

"Seraphina looked right at Audrey and said she took something from them. They want it back."

"Audrey never took anything from them—certainly not a damn pregnancy," Xavier snapped, glaring at me like I’d lost my mind.

"No. But you might have." My voice dripped with accusation.

"I’ve done nothing but protect my daughter!" Xavier roared, jabbing a finger at me. I stayed seated, leaning back, watching him coolly. Sebastian returned and gave me a subtle nod before positioning himself by the door. Good. The girls were safe—and so was Seraphina.

"What did you do that was so bad they’d target Audrey for it?" I demanded.

"I did what I had to!"

"That’s not good enough. Your past is catching up, and this time, it’s threatening my family. Being her biological father doesn’t outweigh the fact that she’s my mate. Sit down and tell us what you did back then so we can figure out why they want something from Audrey."

"I don’t know!" Xavier dragged a hand through his hair. "I lived with rogues, slept in trees, broke into places for street cred, fought in underground rings. I’ve killed men—but they were all scum. Druggies. Rapists. I never touched a woman who didn’t consent, and I put down every bastard I saw who did. Hell, I saved more girls than I can count—left them like I left Audrey. Every few months, I’d hear whispers of a threat against her, and I’d shut it down. I’ve saved this pack more times than you’ll ever know!" His glare was venomous.

"And when did Damian come after you?" I ignored his rant. Maybe he had a point—but he could’ve gone to my father. He didn’t.

Xavier exhaled sharply. "After I took Audrey from them. Magnus had a sick obsession with her."

"Why did Seraphina single out Audrey? What do you think she meant?"

"One night, she cornered me. Drugged out of her mind, whispering about debts and vengeance. Said Audrey stole something precious." His jaw clenched. "Then she pulled a knife."

Sebastian moved like lightning, shoving Xavier back into his seat. "Sit the hell down and start talking. Now."

###Chapter 0313

"Anything more you'd like to confess? This is your last chance." My voice was steady, though uncertainty gnawed at me.

Xavier didn’t answer my question. Instead, he slammed his palms onto my desk, his eyes burning with urgency. "Let me go back in. I'll find out what's really happening. I've spent my whole life protecting her—I won’t stand by now."

"Watch your tone," I warned, my gaze hardening.

"With all due respect," he bit out, "I'm going, whether you approve or not. It’d be better if we worked together, but I’ll do what I have to."

"And what about Vivienne?" I countered.

"She’ll understand. This is about our daughter."

"You’re part of my pack now," I reminded him coldly. "There are rules. Break them, and we’ll have more than just this mess to deal with." Behind him, Sebastian gave a subtle nod—he agreed with sending Xavier in. "You don’t get to kill without proof. I need evidence, not just your word."

Xavier blinked, momentarily stunned, then a reckless grin tugged at his lips. "You’re not stopping me?"

"Xavier," I sighed, pinching the bridge of my nose. "I knew from the moment I met you that you’d be a thorn in my side. If you want to risk your neck digging for answers, fine. One less thing for me to handle. If you die? Oh well." I leaned forward, my voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "Don’t mistake my indifference for mercy—I’ll send every warrior I have to drag your reckless ass out if needed. But at the end of the day, I’ll still be here for Audrey. Succeed, and maybe she’ll hate you a little less. But don’t forget—you got my Beta killed. I don’t forgive. So go ahead. Just know, if you fail, I won’t mourn you."

He turned to leave, but I called after him.

"Xavier."

He glanced back.

"If I find out you lied to me—even by omission—I’ll kill you myself. You report to me. Daily."

"Understood." With a sharp nod, he strode out. Sebastian shut the door behind him and sank into the chair across from me.

"If he dies—"

"One less problem for me."

Sebastian studied me. "Will Audrey forgive you?"

I exhaled sharply. "What would you do in my place?"

"The same," he admitted. "But Audrey isn’t Evelyn."

No, she wasn’t. Evelyn was fire and steel, forged in battle. She could survive anything. But Audrey? Sweet, compassionate Audrey, whose heart was too big for this cruel world—she needed shielding.

I wanted to wrap her in safety, let her raise our children in Rosewood Manor, surrounded by warmth and peace. I dreamed of coming home to chaos—kids laughing, Audrey at the stove, her wild curls escaping her messy bun as she cooked for our family.

Audrey dreamed of saving lost children, just like she had been. And I’d move heaven and earth to make that happen. She saw herself only as a Luna, but she didn’t realize the power she truly held.

If she ever embraced it?

Nothing could stop her.

###Chapter 0314

"This is your show, but it wouldn't hurt to have someone else go undercover to keep tabs on things," Sebastian said, his fingertips pressed together in front of him. The gesture made him look eerily like his father.

"I might know just the person." The moment the words left my lips, Donovan's face flashed in my mind. I grabbed my phone and dialed the number I never wanted to use—speed dial nine.

The line picked up, but only silence and slow, deliberate breathing answered.

"Rosewood blackbird," I said, reciting the code phrase burned into my memory.

"I heard about Alexander. My condolences."

"I need your help with a situation."

"You know my price." His tone was flat, final.

"I'm prepared."

"This must be good."

"You heard about Theodore and Dominic dying? And that I took over as Alpha?"

"I hear everything."

"Rumor has it Raphael and Magnus survived and are coming for me."

"Interesting. Your father never had this much excitement."

Ignoring the jab, I continued, "Audrey's father is Xavier. He wants to go undercover and figure out what they're planning. I need you to gather intel and keep an eye on him."

A pause. Then, "Hmm. I'll get back to you." Click.

He hung up.

"What's the payment?" Sebastian asked.

"Favors."

Sebastian arched a brow. "There's a reason your father forced Evelyn to train. And why we were never attacked."

"Maybe it's not a bad idea to work with Audrey on some basic defense moves," Sebastian suggested.

"Even while she's pregnant?"

"Even the simplest moves can buy time. She just needs to hold them off until we get there."

"You're acting like she'll be in that position." Irritation prickled under my skin.

"I didn't expect Evelyn to get kidnapped once, let alone walk into danger knowing what it meant." Sebastian's expression darkened. "She wouldn't have survived if your father hadn't trained her—or if her wolf wasn't so strong."

"She had eighteen years of training and still came out looking like a punching bag."

"But she was alive," Sebastian said, standing.

I couldn't argue with that. "Let's keep things running as normal. We don't know how immediate the threat is. We gather intel and go from there. Stay cautious, but I can't ask Evelyn to shut down her shop again yet."

"Agreed." Sebastian clapped me on the shoulder as we walked out. "You know we're in this together, right?"

"I sure hope so. I did willingly double your territory," I joked.

"Was that for me or your sister?" He snorted.

"Is there a difference?"

We stepped out of the office and into the car.

Not a single part of me felt good about making that call, but I'd do anything to protect Audrey.

"Evelyn doesn't know about him," I said quietly.

"Understood." Sebastian didn't look at me, his gaze fixed out the window. If there was one thing I knew about him, it was that his word was unbreakable.

When we got back, everyone was lounging on the porch, laughing like they hadn't a care in the world. Three of them were pregnant—relaxation wasn't the worst thing. Relief washed over me when I saw Nathan and Oliver stationed at the bottom of the steps, ready to intercept any threat.

I suddenly realized I still wasn’t wearing a shirt. Neither of us said anything as we approached. I pressed a kiss to Audrey's cheek before sitting on the step below her, draping my arm over her legs as I listened to the conversation.

"Okay, so we’ll come out early to help," Audrey said.

"Help with what?" Sebastian asked, leaning against the porch post.

###Chapter 0315

"Decorating for prom," Sophia announced. "Cassandra and Audrey are coming early to help set everything up."

"The club's grand reopening is Friday," Evelyn said, eyeing me with uncertainty.

"Yeah, it is." I mentally noted the need to ramp up security.

"I have an envelope for you with the dates. The Halloween party is confirmed. I'd love to host it at the event center if it's available," Audrey told Evelyn.

"Perfect. I can't wait to dress up." Evelyn rubbed her hands together, then glanced at Sebastian.

"What are you going as, Grayson?" Nathan asked me.

"A bodyguard." Halloween was the last thing on my mind.

"Oh, boo!" Evelyn gave me a thumbs-down. "Be more creative."

"Beauty and the Beast," Cassandra suggested.

"Oh! I love that!" Audrey beamed.

"You don’t want my wolf loose at a party," I muttered, shaking my head at Evelyn.

"We have plenty of time to decide," Sebastian said, straightening up.

"We should head home. I’ve got things to take care of," I told the group, standing.

"Not staying for dinner?" Evelyn frowned.

"I’ve had enough of you for one day. The last thing I need is to sit through more of your Halloween ideas." I tried to joke, but she just stared at me like I was an idiot.

"What a great brother." She smacked my arm.

"I try," I said, walking off to grab the envelope for Audrey. Truthfully, I didn’t want to see anyone right now. I needed to come clean to Audrey about what had just happened. Keeping her in the dark wasn’t an option.

Grabbing the envelope, I returned to the group. They were all standing, the girls hugging goodbye.

"Here, Scarlett."

"Thank you." She took it from me, pulling me into a hug. Then, so quietly only I could hear, she whispered, "Congratulations. You'll be an amazing father."

I held her tighter before letting go. Our eyes met, and I knew she understood my silent gratitude.

"Ready?" Audrey asked, stepping between us.

"Yeah." Evelyn walked back to Sebastian. After a nod to him, Audrey headed to the car.

The tension was thick, but my focus was on Audrey’s reaction. Nathan didn’t say a word, and neither did Cassandra. The entire drive was suffocating silence.

I needed to talk to Audrey—somewhere private, not the pack house.

"Nathan, Cassandra… we’re heading home for the night." Audrey reached for the door handle but paused.

"Oh? Okay." Nathan motioned for Cassandra to get out.

Audrey stayed silent as they exited and shut the door.

The cabin wasn’t much, but it was enough for tonight. We got out and sat on the steps. A warm breeze played with Audrey’s hair as she waited for me to speak.

"I’m sorry…" I started.

"I’m not going to like this, am I?" She nodded, looking away.

"Probably not," I admitted. "You heard what Seraphina said. Sebastian and I spoke to the only other person who knows Theodore’s inner workings."

Silence stretched before she finally spoke. "Xavier."

"Yeah. He thought he killed Seraphina but confirmed who Magnus and Raphael are. He’s going back undercover to figure out why they’re after you." I dropped the bomb, watching my beautiful mate’s silhouette. She stared at the stars, then closed her eyes when I finished.

###Chapter 0316

Her emotions were a tangled mess—indifference, concern, and even a flicker of relief. Silence stretched between us before she finally spoke. "You're really trusting him with this?"

"Not entirely. But he's kept you alive all these years. I'm counting on that instinct to kick in again."

"He's risking his life." Her voice was flat, a statement, not a question.

"Yes. Audrey, it's not ideal, but he's spent his entire life under the radar. If anyone can navigate this mess, it's him. Do I think he'll be honest with me? No. Do I believe he'll follow the rules? Absolutely not. But I do know he'll do whatever it takes to save you."

"At what cost?" Audrey murmured.

"My only priority is your safety—and our child's."

"And what about the fallout for you?"

"I don't care. As long as you're breathing, nothing else matters." The words left no room for doubt.

"...And if he dies?"

"Then I'm sorry you never got to know your father. But let's not forget—he's the reason Liam is dead."

"This is all just business to you." Again, that detached tone.

"My mate and unborn child were threatened. This is personal. Sending Xavier in? That was business. And if something happens to him? I won't lose sleep over it. I'll still send every warrior we have to drag his reckless ass out of the fire—but I'll sleep just fine afterward."

"What about Vivienne? If he dies, she won't survive either."

"Then they'll finally get their tragic love story." I shrugged. "I'd love for you to have a relationship with her, Audrey. But if it comes down to it? I'll choose your life over hers every time."

"I hate this." Her gaze locked onto mine, sharp and unyielding.

"So do I. This could be nothing—just two idiots blowing smoke who need to be put down. They lost everything. The odds of this being serious are slim." I reached for her hand, squeezing gently.

"You realize Seraphina infiltrated the pack without anyone noticing." The fire in her eyes startled me. "Evelyn checked. Seraphina was never registered as a member. She slipped onto our territory undetected. Our land is massive—that's why we gave them half in the first place. And yet, someone got through."

"Damn. I assume she'll tell Sebastian. I'll still follow up with him. We need to tighten our borders, too."

"How?"

"We're stretched thin with training the new warriors, but I'll do a perimeter sweep tonight. That'll show us where we're vulnerable." I hated night patrols, but there was no avoiding it.

"Victoria came by the office today." Audrey frowned.

"Oh? Why?" That caught me off guard. I hadn't spoken to her since Audrey and I mated.

"She wanted a job. Guess she banked on becoming Luna and never made backup plans."

"Sorry you had to deal with that. Did you hire her?"

"I did. Told her she could assist Ms. Beatrice at the center. Until it opens, she’ll help in the kitchen."

"That was generous of you." I pulled her against me, savoring the electric warmth that always sparked between us. "You're an incredible Luna."

"I hope so." We sat in comfortable silence before she spoke again. "When does Xavier leave?"

"Honestly? He might already be gone. Do you want to see him before he goes?" I studied her face, unsure what she needed.

###Chapter 0317
Audrey's POV

"Not a single damn word!" Grayson shot up from his desk so violently that the entire piece of furniture jerked forward. Nathan had just walked into our office with the mail when Grayson exploded.

"Who?" Nathan asked, bewildered, his gaze flicking between us.

"Xavier! He vanished before we even got back from the baby shower, and I haven't heard a damn thing from him since. He was supposed to check in every day." The fury radiating off Grayson was almost palpable.

Yet, there hadn’t been even a whisper of a threat against me or the pack. Everything was eerily quiet—almost too normal. We had a pack meeting in an hour, followed by the grand reopening of the club. Grayson had even called in extra security, with Sebastian bringing in additional warriors.

I wasn’t about to try calming him down. His mood swings didn’t bother me—if anything, it seemed like he’d inherited all my pregnancy symptoms. Other than needing to sit more often, I felt perfectly fine. So, I stayed in my chair, minding my own damn business.

"You know how these missions go. He might not have a choice," Nathan said, playing devil’s advocate.

The glare Grayson shot him could have melted steel. Nathan wisely shut up.

"Anyway," Nathan continued, "people are already gathering for the meeting. Cassandra finalized the menu and ordered the new computer system. She’s changing and will be down soon."

"How is she holding up?" I asked.

"It took her a while to open up to me. It was… rough."

"I’m proud of her for not letting it destroy her."

"She’s been trying to recall anything that might help." Nathan gripped the back of a chair, leaning forward.

"Interviewing the women isn’t a terrible idea," Grayson muttered.

"Like hell it isn’t! You are not doing that!" I snapped, standing abruptly.

"Why not?" Grayson turned to me, his jaw tight.

I crossed my arms as I stepped closer. "They’ve been through enough trauma. You want to rip open wounds that are barely healed? No. We wait until there’s an actual threat before forcing them to relive those nightmares."

Grayson exhaled sharply, bowing his head as he wrestled with his temper. Finally, he relented. "Fine."

"We need to get to the meeting. Today’s supposed to be a celebration." I checked my watch—we’d already wasted half an hour on this pointless argument.

"See you both downstairs," Nathan said, pushing off the chair and leaving the door ajar behind him.

"Come on. Maybe we can start early." I held out my hand.

Grayson took it—then yanked me against him.

He buried his face in my neck, his arms locking around me as he took slow, measured breaths. He was trying to steady himself.

I decided to distract him. My tongue traced the shell of his ear, and I let out a soft, deliberate moan—one I knew would ignite him.

A deep growl rumbled through his chest, his fingers tightening possessively on my skin. "You really wanna play that game?" His hand slid under my shirt—

"Alpha—oh! I-I’m sorry!" A feminine voice gasped from the doorway. "The door was open, I didn’t—"

I pulled back to see Victoria standing there, her face flushed with embarrassment—and something darker. A flicker of sadness.

"What is it?" Grayson asked, though he didn’t release me.

"I… um…" She hesitated, then took a step back. "Never mind." Before either of us could respond, she bolted.

###Chapter 0318

"That was strange," I murmured, instinctively stepping back from Grayson.

"Not my concern. I have bigger things to worry about than her." Grayson sighed as I snatched his phone. His hand settled on the small of my back as we left our office and headed toward the conference center.

The room was already filling up when we reached the front. Cassandra sat waiting, a forced smile on her pale face. "Hello," she said softly as I took the seat beside her.

"How are you holding up?" I asked. I hadn’t added to her workload yet, unsure of what she could handle. I’d planned to include her in the Luna ceremony—if she was up for it.

"Managing," she replied with a shrug.

"Whenever you're ready, I could use your help with a few things. No rush."

"Actually, more work would be good. Keeps my mind occupied." Relief flickered in her eyes.

"Perfect. I’ll send you the details." Grayson settled beside me, while Nathan took the seat on my other side.

"Almost everyone’s here," Grayson announced, draping an arm over the back of my chair.

"Good. We still need time to change before heading to the club. I want to make sure everything’s set up exactly as I instructed." I checked my watch. Being late wasn’t an option—it sent my anxiety spiraling. I preferred everything done flawlessly and ahead of schedule.

"What are you wearing tonight?" Cassandra asked.

"A red pencil skirt and a black silk blouse." Though lately, I’d started feeling bloated—not quite pregnant, just uncomfortably puffy.

"I can’t decide what to wear," she admitted.

"If the skirt doesn’t work, I’ve got black leather pants and heels as backup. You should wear that brown pantsuit—it looks amazing on you."

"That’s a great idea!" A genuine smile brightened her face.

Grayson stood and whistled sharply. "Thank you all for coming." His voice carried across the room, silencing the chatter. "We have important matters to discuss, so pay attention."

My gaze drifted across the crowd, landing on Vivienne. She sat in a walker with a built-in chair, barely visible near the door, with Ms. Lucille standing protectively beside her.

"First—tonight is the club’s reopening. If you’re of age, you’re welcome to attend. Let me be clear: only good behavior will be tolerated. The press will be there, and any misconduct will be dealt with severely."

"Second—we’re still tying up loose ends. While we adjust to our new normal, I urge all women to stay cautious. Travel in groups or with your mates. The risk is low, but I want everyone safe—especially with alcohol involved." Grayson paused, scanning the room. Every eye was on him; not a single whisper broke the silence.

"Next—the housing development is progressing well. Interior work is starting soon. Luna Evelyn has assigned homes to each family. If you want input on the finishing touches, fill out the forms and submit them to Spencer, head of construction. You’ll find them by the pack house door, labeled with your name and house number. There are different styles to choose from—or mix and match. Deadline is next Friday, or we’ll decide for you."

Some nodded; others whistled or clapped in approval. This was the simplest way to keep everyone happy without chaos.

###Chapter 0319

"Next, you'll see Vivienne walking around. As most of you know, Vivienne has been imprisoned for nineteen years and is still regaining her strength. She is also Luna Audrey’s birth mother. Xavier is her biological father and was supposed to join the warriors but has been temporarily stationed elsewhere. Please welcome them, and feel free to approach us with any concerns."

A few heads turned toward Vivienne. A faint blush colored her cheeks, but she smiled warmly and waved. Ms. Lucille placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder, offering an encouraging smile. My expression remained neutral. Grayson took his seat, and it was my turn to speak.

"The long-awaited update," I began, rising to my feet. "The new buildings under construction are part of a program I’m implementing this year. First, Mrs. Beatrice, please stand." A woman in her mid-forties stood, waving enthusiastically. She reminded me of Ms. Fitzgerald from those old school books. "Mrs. Beatrice is the director of the Development and Rehabilitation Center. Their programs will include an orphanage and daycare, basic development and skills training, an emotional wellness center, and a transition program for those with additional needs." A round of applause erupted before she sat back down.

"Mr. Reginald is the Director of the Advanced Learning Center," I continued. The silver-haired man beside her stood, and I noticed several women giggling. "Their programs focus on advanced studies for all ages, standardized testing, online schooling options, and college-level courses."

Another wave of applause followed—this time, mostly from the women. I smirked. Silver fox indeed.

"Mrs. Margaret—Director of the Early Childhood Development Center—a 24/7 daycare for working parents, catering to children from birth to five years old." She was tall, with long blonde hair and legs that could rival a supermodel’s.

"All these programs are designed to support children from infancy through college. Every child is welcome. Any wolf in need of shelter or food will find what they require here. Like me, I was once an orphan who needed help. It’s my honor to say these resources are now available. Each center will open at the start of the school year, but we need volunteers and paid staff. Please see the respective directors if you're interested."

I paused, letting the applause die down. "We also have prom this Saturday. Let’s all remember to behave—this is our chance to make up for the lockdown. Next, Luna Evelyn and I will have our official Luna ceremonies, likely in September. And mark your calendars—we’re hosting a Halloween party, inviting multiple packs in hopes of finding mates or reuniting chosen pairs. Start brainstorming your costumes now."

Grayson stood as excited murmurs filled the room. "One last announcement—listen up!" The crowd instantly fell silent, eyes locked on us. "I’m thrilled to share that Luna Audrey and I are expecting our first pup!"

The room erupted. The cheers were so deafening I had to cover my ears. Grayson wrapped an arm around my waist, pulling me close as he grinned at his pack. Pride surged through me, pure and overwhelming.

Everyone was on their feet, clapping and cheering. Even the newest members beamed from ear to ear. This was exactly the kind of joy our pack needed. Eventually, Grayson raised a hand to quiet them.

"Everything is progressing well, but I need your help to ensure it stays that way."

###Chapter 0320

"Thank you all for coming!" Grayson announced as the room finally settled into silence. "Enjoy the rest of your evening! As much as we'd love to stay, we need to get changed and head out."

Guests began rising from their seats, murmuring their goodbyes. Grayson took my hand, his grip firm as he guided me through the crowd. People kept calling out congratulations, their voices overlapping in excitement, but he shielded me effortlessly, his presence commanding enough to keep them at bay.

The moment we stepped into our room, Grayson pulled me into a crushing embrace before his lips met mine in a slow, deliberate kiss. I wasn’t usually the type to crave rough, urgent passion—I preferred the slow burn, the lingering touches, the whispered words. But tonight… tonight was different.

Tonight, I wanted fire.

Normally, Grayson took his time undressing me, savoring every inch of skin revealed. But impatience coiled tight in my stomach, and before he could even start, I dropped to my knees and yanked his pants down.

"W-what?" His voice was thick with surprise, but I didn’t answer. Instead, I took him into my mouth, my tongue swirling in a way that made his breath hitch. His hands fisted in my hair as his head tipped back, a deep growl rumbling through his chest.

I’d never been particularly confident in this skill, but watching him unravel beneath me sent a thrill through my veins. Only when his legs trembled and his release spilled down my throat did I finally pull away.

"You’ve never done that before," he rasped, cupping my face and dragging me up for another searing kiss.

"Trying new things," I murmured against his lips as his mouth trailed down my neck.

"Hmm." He walked us backward until we reached the couch, then tugged my shorts down before settling me onto his lap. His fingers slipped inside me, teasing in a way that had me gasping. This was new—Grayson had always stuck to the basics before.

My hands shook as I pulled off my shirt, revealing the delicate lace bra beneath. His fingers withdrew, and he gripped my hips, lifting me just enough to hover over him. I met his darkened gaze, nodding once before he guided me down onto him.

The stretch was exquisite, a delicious pressure that had my head falling back in pleasure.

"Fuck, you’re so tight," Grayson growled, unhooking my bra with one hand while the other kept my hips moving. His claws pricked my skin, his eyes black with need as he watched me unravel.

"Oh, Grayson!" I cried out as the tension coiled tighter inside me.

"Fuck!" His groan was raw as he spilled into me, my own climax crashing over me in waves.

"I’m sorry," he panted, still buried deep inside me.

"Why?" I blinked up at him, confused.

"It felt too good. I couldn’t hold back." His fingers traced my jaw, his expression equal parts smug and awed. "This is a new side of you."

"I know," I admitted, breathless. "I don’t know what came over me. I just… wanted to try something different."

"Is the pregnancy making you more… adventurous?" His fingers tangled in my hair, tugging just enough to make me shiver.

"Maybe?" I bit my lip. "I just know things I wasn’t sure about before sound… fun now."

"Nothing to be ashamed of." His smirk was downright sinful. "Whatever you’re comfortable with, I’m game."

"Oh god, don’t make me write a checklist," I groaned, mortified at the thought.

"How about I surprise you instead?" His voice dropped to a whisper. "Keep it spontaneous. We’ll have a safe word—if it’s too much, I’ll stop."

The promise in his eyes sent heat pooling low in my stomach.

And for the first time, I couldn’t wait to find out what else he had in mind.

###Chapter 0321

"Alright, what's the word?" I breathed out in relief.

"How about Obsidian?" Grayson suggested. "Easy to remember, and you can use it in a sentence without raising suspicion."

"Why would I need to use it in a sentence?" I frowned, sliding off him.

"Are you showering?" Grayson ignored my question, his gaze trailing over me.

"We don’t have time. I’ll just clean up and get dressed."

"Fine." He smirked, giving my backside a playful smack as I headed to the bathroom.

After freshening up, I touched up my curls and reapplied my makeup before striding naked into the closet. The only undergarment I could wear was a black lace bra. Slipping into the pencil skirt, I felt an unexpected thrill—this was the first time I’d ever gone without underwear.

With my belly slightly swollen, this would probably be the last time this skirt fit.

Grayson entered just as I was fastening my strappy heels.

"I don’t know about this skirt," I muttered, standing up. "I know I’m pregnant, but this just makes me look… thick."

"You look stunning." His voice was low as he wrapped an arm around me.

Then I saw it—a black velvet box in his hand, impossible to miss.

"What’s this?"

"It was my mother’s." He opened the box. "It’s priceless. Scarlett was going through the family heirlooms and found this. It’s been passed down to the firstborn for generations. I want you to have it."

Inside lay a delicate silver chain with a single black obsidian stone at its center.

Grayson fastened it around my neck, the pendant resting perfectly at the base of my throat. The black silk blouse I wore accentuated it beautifully, the V-neckline framing the stone.

"It’s gorgeous," I whispered.

"That was kind of Scarlett to give it to you."

Some people never understood their bond, but having grown up with it, I never questioned it.

"She’s still processing everything, but she insisted it was rightfully mine. We can pass it down to our child someday."

"We should probably start drafting a will, like your father did," I mused, turning to face him. "I love it. Thank you for trusting me with it."

"You’re the only one I’d ever trust." He kissed me softly.

"Is that why you chose Obsidian as our safe word?" I asked as he pulled away, heading for the door.

He was dressed in his usual all-black attire but had added a deep red tie to match me.

"Exactly."

"Clever, Alpha Grayson."

"We never settled on whether you wanted to be called Alpha or Luna," he remarked as we descended the stairs.

"I don’t really see myself as an Alpha. We merged packs and kept our roles. It’s not like we don’t rule together."

"So, you’re fine with Luna?"

"I have just as much authority as you, even as Luna. Unless—"

"Alpha!" A warrior’s voice boomed through the hall as the doors burst open.

We had just reached the bottom step when two warriors dragged in a figure wrapped in a blanket.

Grayson instantly pulled me behind him as the room fell silent.

###Chapter 0322

A car screeched to a halt a few hundred yards from the gate, its tires kicking up dust. The door swung open, and a figure was shoved out before the vehicle sped away like a shadow in the night.

Nathan and Cassandra were descending the stairs when Grayson approached the girl. Her hair was a tangled mess, strewn with leaves and dirt. One eye was swollen shut, her arms bore faint track marks, and grime coated every inch of her skin.

"Alpha Grayson?" Her voice was barely a whisper, cracked and raw.

Grayson knelt but kept a careful distance. "Yes?"

"Giselle?" Cassandra stepped around Grayson, her breath catching.

"Cass?"

"Oh my gods—Giselle!" Cassandra rushed forward, wrapping her arms around the trembling girl.

Giselle pushed her away weakly, her gaze locking onto Grayson. "I need to speak with you alone, Alpha."

"Cassandra, take her to my office," Grayson ordered, rising to his feet.

Cassandra helped Giselle up, but the tension in Grayson's expression was unmistakable. Slowly, they made their way to the office, where Giselle collapsed onto the couch.

"Giselle, what happened to you?" Evelyn asked as Nathan closed the door behind them.

"Xavier got me out," Giselle rasped. "He told me to tell you—he wants to meet. Sunday. Two in the morning. At the hospital southeast of town. He said... you have to go alone."

Her words hung heavy in the air.

Grayson's jaw tightened.

Cassandra looked between them, her eyes wide with worry. "You can't seriously be considering this."

Grayson exhaled sharply. "We don't have a choice."

Nathan stepped forward. "It's a trap."

"Probably," Grayson admitted. "But if Xavier has information, we need it."

Evelyn's fingers curled into fists. "He's not dead."

Grayson shot her a sideways glance. "Were you worried?"

"Yes. No. I just—I thought he might have been captured."

Grayson's grip on the steering wheel turned his knuckles white as he peeled out of the driveway. "He's survived nineteen years off the grid. He's not stupid enough to get caught now."

Evelyn leaned over, her lips brushing his ear. "Everything will be okay."

Grayson didn't relax, but his fingers loosened slightly on the wheel.

For now, that was enough.

###Chapter 0323

"Are you trying to make us even later?" Grayson growled, his hand sliding possessively over my backside.

"Just thought you could use a little mood booster," I teased, biting my lip.

"Oh, I'm in a mood alright," he murmured darkly, his fingers tightening. "Might have to keep you pregnant if this is the kind of distraction I get."

Ignoring that dangerous promise, I leaned in as we rounded the corner, my lips brushing his ear. "No panties today."

Grayson's grip on the steering wheel turned white-knuckled as he fought to keep his wolf in check. We were already cutting it close.

The moment we pulled up, a warrior was at my door, bowing slightly. "Luna."

Head held high, I strutted toward the waiting group, satisfaction curling through me at the heated gaze burning into my back.

"Really? Now?" Evelyn arched a brow, disapproval dripping from her tone as she glanced between us.

Sebastian placed a calming hand on her shoulder before she could say more.

"Grayson! We can't stall much longer!" The reporter—some overly eager woman with too much hairspray—bounced toward us, flashing a smile that made my wolf bristle.

"We're ready," I cut in, stepping forward.

Her eyes raked over me before curling her lips. "Good. Get in position—"

"She stands with me." Grayson's voice left no room for argument as he yanked me to his side.

Evelyn smirked, clearly entertained, while Sebastian took his place behind her. Oliver and Sophia hovered near Evelyn, while Nathan and Cassandra flanked us.

"A bit crowded, but if you want it to look awkward..." The reporter huffed, turning to the cameraman.

"3... 2... 1... Action!"

"Good evening, everyone! We're here for the grand reopening of Moonhowl! After an unexpected closure, owners Grayson Andrews and Evelyn Blackwood are back in business!" She turned, batting her lashes at Grayson. "Rumors say structural issues forced the shutdown. Care to comment?"

"Actually," Grayson cut in smoothly, "we suffered a loss in the family. Despite the misinformation, we're reopening stronger than ever. Family is everything to us. We appreciate the support and promise the same high standards."

Before she could pry further, he snatched the scissors and sliced through the red ribbon. Cheers erupted down the street.

"I think we're done here," Evelyn announced, voice sharp. The reporter opened her mouth, but Evelyn beat her to it. "Goodbye."

Without another word, she strode inside. Nathan and Oliver held the doors as we slipped in, then promptly shut them behind us, leaving the press outside.

"Welcome back, everyone," Grayson said, flashing that politician-perfect smile. "You'll notice some upgrades. Take the next few hours to familiarize yourselves before we open to the public."

The staff dispersed, and we headed toward the office. I lingered, running my fingers over the polished dance floor. The rest of the club had distressed wood—easier to clean than carpet, given the inevitable spills (and the fact that drunk wolves had terrible aim).

The employee lounge was a massive improvement—new fridge, lockers, even a chore chart.

Part of me still felt like an outsider. Grayson and Evelyn had always handled this. But with him distracted lately, I'd stepped up. Life didn’t stop just because we were fighting for my sister.

Maybe that’s why Evelyn and I worked so well together. She saw the big picture. I handled the details.

###Chapter 0324

The bar gleamed under the soft glow of the overhead lights. Behind the counter, bartenders meticulously polished glasses and sliced fresh fruit for cocktails. Others restocked salts and syrups, ensuring everything was prepped for the night ahead. I even spotted a few employees labeling bottles with expiration dates. No one could deny we had the most dedicated pack members around.

The DJ flicked switches, testing the sound system and lighting to guarantee flawless performance. A final inspection of the bathrooms was underway, while tables were arranged to perfection. Everything looked impeccable—until I stepped into the office.

Chaos greeted me.

Papers were strewn across the floor, a chair lay overturned, and Grayson looked ready to murder someone.

"My dear brother needs to take a breath," Evelyn said, hands planted on her hips as she stood between Grayson and the rest of the room. He glared down at her, irritation rolling off him in waves. Sebastian and the others lounged on the couches, watching the twin showdown unfold.

"How are you not furious?" Grayson bit out, his voice strained with forced calm.

"Oh, I am furious," Evelyn countered, gesturing sharply at the wrecked office. "But I’m not throwing tantrums and destroying our workspace!"

Grayson’s gaze snapped to Sebastian. Without a word, Sebastian stood and strode out, Grayson following close behind.

"Where are they going?" I asked, bewildered.

"To fight," Evelyn sighed, righting the overturned chair.

"Let me." Nathan jumped up, taking the chair from her before she could lift it.

"To fight?" My pulse spiked.

"Don’t worry," Evelyn waved a dismissive hand. "They did this when things got intense with me. Sebastian needed an outlet, and Grayson was happy to oblige. They’ll avoid faces and keep it clean—just enough to burn off the aggression." She began gathering scattered papers, stacking them neatly on the desk.

"He’s done this before?"

"Yep. We were both asleep last time, so you probably didn’t notice." She sounded utterly unfazed.

"I could’ve fought him," Nathan muttered, clearly annoyed.

"No, you couldn’t have," Evelyn shot him a pointed look. "He needed someone who could match him." She left the rest unspoken, but Nathan seemed to understand.

"Is there any chance I can head home now?" Cassandra glanced at Nathan.

"Not yet," I said. "Wait until they get back. I know you’re eager to see her." Cassandra didn’t argue, just crossed her arms and leaned into Nathan as he pulled her into a reassuring hug.

Evelyn and I sorted through paperwork, signing forms for the club and upcoming events—prom, Luna ceremonies, even the Halloween bash. She showed me stunning invitations she’d designed.

"Do you still have all the addresses?"

"On my home computer. Want me to email you the list? It’s formatted for printing—just load the labels and hit print."

"I’ll handle it," Evelyn said, widening her eyes as if to say, Thank the Moon it’s your problem now.

"Gee, thanks," I deadpanned as the office door swung open.

The guys walked in, lightly glistening with sweat but otherwise unharmed. Sebastian lingered by the door, his gaze locking onto Evelyn. Grayson approached me, pressing a kiss to my cheek before attempting to drape his arms over my shoulders. I shoved him off.

"How’s it going in here?" he asked, the hurt in his eyes unmistakable.

Right now, I didn’t care.

###Chapter 0325

"We completed everything while you were busy throwing your fit." I stood abruptly, not bothering to glance at Grayson as I maneuvered around the desk and strode toward Sebastian.

His lips twitched with amusement, but he stepped aside without protest, letting me pass. Silence followed me out. I couldn’t pinpoint why his overbearing protectiveness grated on me so much today.

There hadn’t been an actual threat—just some foolish girl spouting nonsense. Yet Grayson was acting like I was in the same danger Evelyn had faced. Just because I was pregnant, he was losing his damn mind.

The back room was stacked high with boxes. Three unfamiliar faces were unpacking and organizing. "Did anyone verify the shipment when it arrived?" I scanned the chaos.

A slender girl with long, brittle black hair—new clothes, hair pulled back—handed me two sheets of paper. "Yes, Luna. I checked. This is the inventory list, and it matches the shipping label."

"Perfect. Thanks." I took the papers. She smiled before returning to work—either from Sebastian’s pack or one of our recent recruits.

"Everything set here?" Oliver appeared in the doorway. In all this time, I’d barely exchanged more than two sentences with him.

"Yeah, we're good. Is security ready?" I brushed past him into the main area. Sebastian was speaking with a figure clad in black, while Cassandra lingered near the entrance. Something about her rubbed me the wrong way.

"All set." Oliver studied me, then followed my gaze to Cassandra. "Problem?"

"I don’t know."

He gripped my elbow, steering me to a secluded corner. "Talk."

"It’s Cassandra. Ever since that girl showed up today, I can’t shake this feeling about her behavior."

Oliver crossed his arms, leaning against the wall. To anyone watching, we looked like we were having a casual chat. "Voice it. Helps to hear it aloud."

"Cassandra said Raphael was mated to Seraphina—her sister. Their brother was Magnus. But I swear Grayson told me Dominic introduced his gamma as Adrian. When Dominic confronted Evelyn at her shop, didn’t he introduce Julian as his beta and Adrian as his gamma? Cassandra’s urgency to return to Giselle feels... off. Maybe I misheard. Or maybe no one paid attention to the beta and gamma with Dominic and Evelyn dominating the scene. It might not even matter." My words tumbled out as I watched Cassandra check her watch, scanning the room.

Oliver stayed quiet, his stare intense. "Have you told Grayson?"

"Between his stellar level-headedness and chill demeanor? I don’t even know if I’m right—or if this is what’s bothering me."

###Chapter 0326

"Let's go. They need to know this. Even if he's being a little dramatic right now." Oliver gripped my elbow, nudging me forward.

"I thought I was supposed to be the emotional one? He's just overreacting." I muttered under my breath. This wasn’t like me, but irritation prickled under my skin. Oliver snorted but stayed silent. Sebastian watched us approach before falling into step behind us as we headed toward the office.

"Nathan, stay." Oliver said as we entered. Nathan had been on his way out but paused at the command.

"Oliver?" Sebastian questioned, shutting the door behind us. I was the only other woman in the room—where Evelyn had gone, I had no idea. Grayson sat behind his desk, reclined in his chair, fingers steepled beneath his chin. Only half his mouth was visible, but the tension in his jaw was unmistakable.

"Audrey has something to share." Oliver pushed me forward before stepping back.

"Do I?" I shot him a glare.

"You do." He perched on the arm of the couch, arms crossed.

"Why do I need to stay?" Nathan frowned.

"Just stand by Sebastian." Oliver nodded toward him. Sebastian seemed to understand, his posture shifting, muscles tensing as if preparing for something.

"Audrey, what’s going on?" Grayson’s voice was calm, but his gaze was sharp. I felt like a student called to the principal’s office, about to tattle on someone. The old saying snitches get stitches echoed in my mind.

"I don’t know if it’s even important." I shifted uncomfortably, glancing at the men around me.

"Just say it." Oliver pressed.

"Fine. But this is the last time I let you drag me into this." I scowled at him. He smirked, clearly amused by my frustration.

"Audrey, what is it?" Nathan looked between us, confusion furrowing his brow.

"Okay, so I might be remembering this wrong. I wasn’t part of those conversations—I only came in after Grayson and I mated. Even then, he didn’t include me in decisions." I met Grayson’s eyes. "I only know what you told me privately."

"But…?" Grayson prompted, fingers still pressed together.

"I swear you told me when Dominic came into Evelyn’s tattoo shop, he introduced Julian as his Beta and Adrian as his Gamma. Cassandra told us her brother, Magnus, was Gamma. I don’t know if Adrian died and Magnus got promoted, or if they lied and Adrian was never Gamma. But it’s bothering me how desperate Cassandra is to get to Giselle. She’s never been the type to offer emotional support—or accept it. Even now, she didn’t even want to ask me for help." I looked at Nathan pleadingly.

Silence settled over the room when I finished. Nathan’s expression darkened, his jaw clenching as he struggled to find words.

"So, you’re saying Cassandra is hiding something?" Nathan finally spoke, taking a step toward me. Sebastian immediately blocked him, a firm hand on his chest. Oliver stood and moved to Nathan’s other side. "Seriously? You think I’d attack my own Luna?" Nathan’s voice rose, anger flashing in his eyes.

"I’m sorry, Nathan. Like I said, it might be nothing!" My stomach twisted with guilt.

"Nathan, calm down. You were there when Dominic introduced everyone. Audrey isn’t wrong." Grayson didn’t move, his voice steady.

"Grayson, do you honestly believe Cassandra could be involved in this?" Nathan’s voice cracked with desperation. Sebastian kept his hand firmly in place.

"I think there’s a logical explanation. I’m not saying Audrey is right or wrong—just that this needs to be addressed. Take Cassandra home. Have a quiet night together. But I’m ordering you—don’t say a word about this to her. Tomorrow, we’ll bring her in and talk this through rationally. She might have a simple answer. And until then, she doesn’t see Giselle."

The weight of the room pressed down on us all. Nathan’s shoulders slumped, but he didn’t argue. The tension was thick enough to cut with a knife.

###Chapter 0327

Nathan opened his mouth to speak but quickly shut it. Instead, he shot Grayson a glare before turning on his heel and storming out, slamming the door behind him.

"Got it," Oliver muttered before following Nathan out.

"This might be nothing at all," I murmured to myself, tilting my head back to stare at the ceiling. Tiny flecks of silver paint shimmered like stars against the dark blue, mimicking a night sky.

"I don’t think Cassandra has it in her to be a spy," Sebastian said, sinking into the couch with a sigh.

"Neither do I," Grayson admitted, though his expression remained troubled. "But I can’t shake this feeling—ever since Seraphina showed up, something’s been off. Cassandra never mentioned her brother couldn’t have been the gamma until now. She just kept saying she didn’t know anything." His gaze lingered on the door.

"Maybe she really doesn’t," Sebastian muttered under his breath. "Hell, for all we know, Raphael and Magnus could just be two-bit liars who don’t even hold ranks. They might’ve fed Seraphina and Cassandra some story about him being gamma. Cassandra told us her father was dead and her mother was a warrior, but back then, women were treated like glorified maids. If her mother moved packs to be with her mate, she could’ve been used too."

"There’s a lot more to Cassandra’s story than we realize," Grayson concluded.

"I’m going to check on things. Doors open in five," Sebastian announced, pushing himself up and striding out.

The moment the door clicked shut, Grayson turned to me. "Why didn’t you tell me about this?"

I scoffed. "Because you’ve been so emotionally available lately? Because you exclude me from meetings, keep me in the dark, and expect me to play the perfect little mate while you’re off doing who-knows-what? I did what I had to because Evelyn’s life was in danger, and I know how much she means to you. Hell, she’s like a sister to me—she saved me. But this isn’t about her. It’s about me." I didn’t move an inch closer to him.

"Audrey, I—" Grayson inhaled sharply.

"Save it," I cut him off. "We have guests to greet. Let’s go." Dropping the shipping information on the desk, I walked out without checking if he followed.

The music pulsed through the club as I made my way to the entrance. Nathan was gone, but the rest of the group lingered nearby.

"Where’s Grayson?" Evelyn asked.

Before I could answer, his voice came from behind me. "Right here. Open the doors." His arm slid around my waist, firm and possessive. Sebastian noticed the way my jaw clenched but said nothing, instead nudging Evelyn aside as Oliver unlocked the doors.

Sophia sat perched on a stool by the wall, safely out of the way of the incoming crowd.

"Welcome!" Evelyn beamed as people streamed in. The bouncers checked IDs and scanned for weapons, slowing the flow, but the place still filled up fast. Within minutes, the bar was packed, bodies pressing together in the dim light.

"Let’s grab our table," Oliver called over the noise. Sophia rubbed her lower back, supporting the weight of her belly as we followed them to a U-shaped booth.

"This is where we were when we found out we were mates," Sophia said, glancing at Oliver with a soft smile.

"Same booth, but you look a little different now," Oliver teased, resting a hand on her stomach. The rest of us watched them fondly. Evelyn and I just looked bloated from the drinks.

"Not much longer and you’ll finally meet your little one!" Evelyn squealed.

"I’m beyond ready to not be pregnant anymore," Sophia agreed with a tired laugh.

"I bet. You don’t exactly look comfortable," I said sympathetically.

###Chapter 0328

"I can't stay. My back feels like it's on fire."

Sophia winced as she shifted in her seat, rubbing her swollen belly.

Evelyn frowned, concern etching her features. "Let me arrange a ride for you."

"As much as I'd love to stay, I think I'll take you up on that offer." Sophia glanced at Oliver, who was already standing.

"I'll drive her home and come right back," Oliver said, looking to Sebastian for approval. Sebastian gave a quick nod.

"Good night! And congratulations again on the opening!" Sophia managed a smile as she carefully stood, Oliver's hands steadying her as they made their way out.

Evelyn turned to Grayson, arms crossed. "Are you ever going to stop being such a stubborn ass?"

Grayson rolled his eyes. "Come on, Audrey. There's something I need to show you." He grabbed her hand, pulling her from the booth and down the stairs before she could protest.

She had no idea where he was leading her until he pushed open a door at the back of the club. It was a storage room, cluttered with extra supplies, the door lacking even a basic lock.

"What—" Audrey barely got the word out before Grayson's hand cupped the back of her neck, his lips crashing against hers in a searing kiss.

"I know I've been an idiot," he murmured against her skin, his mouth trailing down her throat. Her thoughts scattered as she glanced nervously at the door.

"Someone could walk in..." Her breath hitched as his fingers traced the curve of her waist.

"You said you wanted spontaneity," Grayson growled, his palm sliding down to grip her ass.

"You seriously want to do this here?" This wasn’t exactly what she’d had in mind.

"I need you. Right now." His voice was rough with desire.

"But there's no bed—" Her protest died as his fingers hooked under the hem of her skirt, hiking it up. She wasn’t wearing anything underneath, and the slick heat between her thighs betrayed how much she wanted him.

"So?" Grayson backed her against the wall, his body pressing into hers. The muffled sound of laughter and voices passed by outside the door, making her pulse spike.

"I—" She gasped as he tugged her shirt free, pulling it over her head before unhooking her bra with practiced ease.

"Damn, you're so fucking perfect," he muttered, dropping to his knees. His tongue traced a slow, torturous path up her inner thigh before licking into her folds.

Her leg lifted of its own accord, resting on his shoulder as he devoured her. The sensation was overwhelming—part panic, part desperate need.

"Oh God—" Her fingers tangled in his hair as his fingers joined his mouth, curling inside her. His other hand found her breast, thumb circling her nipple in time with the rhythm of his tongue.

"Come for me, princess," he commanded against her skin.

The nickname sent a shiver through her—reserved only for moments like this, when he wanted to remind her just how much she meant to him.

Her body arched as pleasure crashed over her, her moans muffled against her own wrist. She couldn’t stop herself from grinding against his mouth, chasing the sensation.

When she finally pulled him up, his lips met hers in a bruising kiss. He freed himself from his pants in one swift motion, lifting her leg to his hip as he lined himself up.

"Look at me," he demanded.

The moment her eyes locked with his, he thrust inside, filling her completely. His pace was relentless but controlled, each movement driving her higher.

The sounds of the club outside faded into nothing. There was only him—his body, his touch, the way he made her feel.

And in that moment, nothing else mattered.

###Chapter 0329

His gaze lingered on me for a moment longer before he granted my request. My cheeks burned, but the pleasure coursing through me was unlike anything I had ever experienced. I adored the slow, tender lovemaking—the way Grayson traced every inch of my body with reverence. But this was different. This was raw, primal, a need I hadn’t even known I possessed.

Just as I teetered on the edge of climax again, the door handle rattled. Grayson reached out, gripping it firmly, but he didn’t stop moving inside me. I clapped a hand over my mouth, my eyes wide as I stared at him.

He watched the way my body responded to each thrust, his gaze dark with hunger. The pressure built until it shattered me completely. My fangs descended as I bit down on his shoulder, perhaps harder than necessary. My body trembled as I pulled back, but he didn’t let me lick the wound clean. Instead, he fisted his hand in my hair, tilting my head back to expose my throat.

He didn’t hesitate.

The door shook again as someone pounded against it. Grayson let out a low, warning growl, and the noise ceased. Still, he didn’t withdraw, keeping me pinned against the wall.

“I’m sorry, princess,” he murmured against my ear, his voice rough. “I’ll do better.”

“Good,” was all I managed to say, my entire face tingling with the aftermath.

Finally, he set me down, scanning the room before grabbing some paper towels to clean us up.

“You should go without panties more often,” he teased, smirking as he helped me straighten my dress.

I arched a brow. “What if it’s windy and my dress flies up?”

He hummed thoughtfully, finishing dressing before stepping close again. His fingers combed through my hair, smoothing the wild strands before he cupped my face in his hands. “I can’t stand the thought of anything happening to you,” he admitted, his expression torn between adoration and fear.

I kissed him softly. “Let’s go dance.”

Thankfully, no one lingered outside when we left. Grayson disposed of the paper towels in a nearby trash can, though most wolves here would catch the scent of what we’d just done.

“I hope that put you in a better mood,” Evelyn remarked as we rejoined them on the dance floor.

I was certain my face couldn’t get any redder—yet somehow, it did.

“Judging by your hair, you don’t have room to talk,” Grayson shot back, wrapping his arms around me. He pulled me close, his lips brushing my neck.

“At least we’re not as emotional as Sophia,” Evelyn grumbled. Sebastian and Grayson both nodded in agreement.

“Damn it,” Sebastian muttered, grabbing Evelyn’s hands as she ground against him.

Grayson chuckled, turning me to face him. “I’m just grateful you only want this,” he joked, guiding my arms around his neck.

We lost ourselves in the rhythm, our foreheads pressed together as the music swallowed us whole.

###Chapter 0330

The music shifted, signaling the end of the night. The DJ's voice boomed through the speakers. "Last call, folks! You don’t have to go home, but you can’t stay here!"

Semisonic’s Closing Time started playing as the lights brightened. Grayson stepped back, but the heat in his gaze told me sleep wouldn’t be on the agenda tonight.

"I need to shut down the office computer," Evelyn told Sebastian as Grayson pulled me close and kissed me. He clearly wasn’t ready to stop, but rules were rules.

"Come on," I whispered, tugging his hand. "We’ve got a few last things to wrap up."

We followed Evelyn and Sebastian upstairs to the office.

"What’s left to do?" Grayson asked, shutting the door behind us.

Evelyn dropped a stack of papers onto the desk. "Just need your signature on these."

Grayson frowned as he flipped through them. "What’s all this?"

"Shipping logistics," I explained. "I set up auto-shipping so nothing gets missed if we’re swamped. Payroll’s accessible remotely, and I loaded the security app on your phone." I glanced at Evelyn. "She already signed. Now it’s your turn."

His brows lifted. "When did you handle all this?"

"Over the last week. You’ve been focused on other things, so I just took care of it." My tone carried a hint of irritation.

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Have you two even had time to just be together?"

I shrugged. "Not really, but it’s fine."

"How is that fine?" she pressed.

The words spilled out before I could stop them. "When we found out we were mates, he was too busy saving you to notice me. And I get it—that’s where his focus should’ve been. I’m not mad. But I was never part of your group before, so nothing’s changed. He treats me the same way he treated Victoria. I mean, I’m sure he was a decent boyfriend, but he doesn’t include me in decisions. So I just… stay in the background and hope I’m doing what he likes."

Silence.

Grayson and Evelyn stared at me, stunned. Sebastian just nodded slowly, like it all made sense.

Mortified, I ducked my head and bolted for the door. Tears pricked my eyes as I stepped into the hall, but I refused to let them fall.

Downstairs, the staff was cleaning up, humming along to the music. I wandered toward the dance floor—then tripped over something hard.

The crunch was louder than expected, sending me stumbling.

"Whoa! Luna, you okay?" A worker—Audrey—reached for me as I caught myself.

Grayson, Evelyn, and Sebastian rushed over, having seen me falter.

I looked down. A small yellow-and-black object oozed something dark.

"Don’t touch it!" Evelyn shrieked, backing away.

The command startled me so badly my wolf flared in response.

Grayson wrapped an arm around me. "What’s wrong?"

Sebastian’s face paled. "That’s one of those bees."

"The kind that exploded and knocked me out?" Grayson’s voice turned lethal. "The same ones Theodore had hundreds of? The ones we thought were all destroyed?"

His anger grew with every word.

###Chapter 0331

"Yes!" Evelyn's fingers dug into Sebastian's arm, her knuckles turning white.

"I thought we eliminated all of them," Nathan growled, his anger palpable.

"This means Lorenzo or Magnus are still watching us," Sebastian muttered under his breath. He turned to a nearby pack member. "Get me gloves, a container, and cleaning supplies." The member nodded and hurried off.

"Did you touch it?" Nathan asked me sharply.

"No, I only stepped on it."

The pack member returned with everything Sebastian had requested. Slipping on the gloves, he carefully picked up the bee and sealed it inside a plastic bag. Then, grabbing the disinfectant, he sprayed the area thoroughly. The strong scent of bleach filled the air, and a faint wisp of smoke rose from the spot. Nathan pulled Evelyn and me back as Sebastian leaned away. Once finished, he peeled off the gloves and tossed them into the trash.

"This was too direct," Nathan remarked, locking eyes with Sebastian.

"If it was on the ground and didn't activate, either it was dead or out of range," Sebastian countered.

"Or it didn’t find its target," I blurted out without thinking. Both men turned to stare at me. "What? I may not have an IQ of 144, but I’m not clueless." Shoving past Nathan, I marched toward the door, half-expecting him to stop me. Instead, his footsteps fell in sync beside me.

Nathan unlocked the car and opened my door before circling to the driver’s side. Silence stretched between us as he drove, deliberately passing our usual turnoff.

"Where are we going?" I finally asked when curiosity won out.

"Somewhere to get away from Margaret. I haven’t been there in years."

"Why bring me?" I pressed, though I already had my suspicions.

"You were right," he admitted, his grip tightening on the wheel. "I’ve been so focused on Evelyn that I’ve failed as your mate. I’m sorry." He reached over, taking my hand and pressing a lingering kiss to my knuckles. "I want to show you the places I’ve saved for this—for sharing only with my mate."

Part of me wanted to ask why now, but I bit my tongue. "What kind of place is it?"

"Just up ahead." Nathan veered off the main road onto an overgrown trail winding through dense trees. The full moon cast silver light over the path, guiding us forward. He slowed to a stop, then quickly rounded the car to meet me as I stepped out.

Nathan grabbed my hand, practically dragging me forward like an eager child. "Are we running there?" I couldn’t help but laugh at his enthusiasm.

"I’ve just… waited so long for this," he admitted, turning to face me with a rare, unrestrained smile. "I always wanted to bring someone special here. Now I finally can."

I didn’t respond—because Nathan suddenly stopped. "What?" I frowned.

"Keep walking." He nudged me forward gently. Releasing his hand, I took a few hesitant steps past the tree line—and froze.

The world opened up before us. We stood atop a hill overlooking a tranquil lake, its surface shimmering with reflected starlight. Owls glided silently overhead, and the chorus of crickets echoed through the valley.

"It’s breathtaking," I whispered as Nathan moved behind me, his arms sliding around my waist.

"Yes, you are," he murmured, turning me to face him. "I have something to confess."

My stomach dropped. I took a step back, bracing myself.

But Nathan only smirked at my expression, chuckling. "I’ve been planning this for a while now..."

"Planning what?" I demanded as he suddenly retreated into the shadows of the trees.

###Chapter 0332

"Grayson?" A sharp pang of fear shot through me before he reappeared with a blanket and pillow in hand.

"Did you really think I'd leave you?" He spread the blanket out and tossed the pillow down, then patted the space beside him.

"The thought might have crossed my mind." I sat down, still feeling awkward. I was still annoyed that I hadn’t wanted to cuddle earlier, but the sight before me was impossible to resist.

Grayson sat up and pulled something from his pocket. "I made this for you."

"You made this?" It was a boho-style bracelet—dark brown rope woven between wooden beads, with a tiny carved wolf dangling at the end.

"Well, when I was about twelve. Carving’s always been a hobby. I don’t know if you remember, but we weren’t exactly in the same circles back then. Still, there was one night… I was out in the woods, leaning against an old tree—"

"I went for a walk and saw you." The memory clicked into place. "You had a split lip and told me you were just getting fresh air."

"Exactly. I was whittling a stick."

"You said when you found your mate, you’d treat her like a princess. Show her the world. Never let anyone hurt her." My stomach twisted. That was the night Margaret broke Evelyn’s arm. He’d been angry, trying to cool off. "I was actually scared of you that night."

Grayson’s fingers brushed over the bracelet. "After you left, I vowed to give this to my mate one day—as a reminder of the promise I made to myself. To treat her like a princess. To show her everything. To be the man she needed." He took my wrist, fastened the bracelet, and tightened it gently.

"I can’t believe you remember that." My voice was barely a whisper.

"I know the timing with Evelyn wasn’t ideal, and I’ll always regret that. But I never forgot about this. I had a whole plan—a proper date, some grand gesture—but then Seraphina showed up, and suddenly, my focus shifted from Evelyn’s safety to the pack’s, and now to yours." His thumb traced my pulse point. "I call you my princess because that’s what you are. You and this baby—you’re my whole world. I want to protect you. I used to dream about coming home to my mother’s house, finding you at the stove, your hair a mess, kids running underfoot, the smell of apple pie in the air. No worries. Just happiness." He exhaled. "But I know that’s just my own past talking—what I wanted after seeing what Evelyn went through. If that’s not the life you want, tell me. You can sit in on every meeting. Help make every decision. Whatever you want. Just say the word, and I’ll make it happen."

I couldn’t speak. My body moved before my mind caught up—I launched myself at him, knocking him backward. His arms locked around me as mine wound around his neck. My lips crashed against his, and he laughed into the kiss.

"I love the bracelet," I murmured against his mouth.

"Good. I’ve been saving it for years. Funny how it was always meant for you." He rolled us over, pinning me beneath him, his fingers tracing my cheek. "You have no idea how much I love you."

"You’ve mentioned." I smirked up at him.

"Love doesn’t even feel like a strong enough word." He brushed my hair back, his gaze intense.

"I don’t need to be involved in every pack decision. I want to focus on my projects and raising our family. But when it comes to Magnus or Raphael—I want to be part of that."

###Chapter 0333

"Then we'll make it happen." Grayson's lips brushed mine in a featherlight kiss. "How many pups do you envision us having?"

"Pups?" A delighted laugh bubbled up from my chest.

"We've never really talked about the personal details. How many children? What names? How should we design their nursery?" Grayson propped himself up on one elbow, his other hand resting possessively on my abdomen.

"I adore the first design for a girl - but less pink than Evelyn's room. More natural tones like forest greens and burgundy. For a boy, I imagined a wilderness theme with animals, mountains in shades of navy, slate and charcoal."

"Perfect." His chin dipped in approval.

"As for names... I haven't given it much thought yet. Though I have an entire folder of baby items saved on my laptop."

"I've always favored strong names like Duke, Anton or Hunter." Grayson's thumb traced absent circles on my stomach.

"Those are beautiful. For girls, I've always been partial to Paige. Or perhaps Dawn... Maya has a lovely ring to it too."

"They'd pair beautifully with Jeffery." His lips quirked.

"I want them to be resilient and driven, yet free to chase their own destinies." That was the future I envisioned for our children.

"They'll be treasured beyond measure." His hand stilled over where our child grew as his voice thickened with emotion.

"Will you still pursue that degree you mentioned?" Grayson rolled onto his back, pulling me with him to gaze at the star-strewn sky.

"Perhaps. After we handle this threat and welcome our little one. Priorities shift, but that doesn't mean I won't revisit it in a year or two."

"Don't abandon your dreams for this."

"I'm living my dream." My fingers laced through his. "A mate who's the most selfless, breathtaking man I know. A pup on the way. A pack that honors us. I couldn't be happier."

Comfortable silence settled between us. For the first time, I felt truly connected - as if the world had narrowed to just us two beneath the infinite sky.

"We should head back." I murmured after a while.

"Agreed. Big day tomorrow." Grayson rose effortlessly before pulling me up. "Surprised you didn't try to take advantage of me out here." His smirk was pure sin.

"Still recovering from nearly getting caught last time. Though I won't stop you if you want to continue this at home." I winked before darting toward the tree line.

"Is that so?" His longer strides caught me effortlessly.

"Absolutely, Alpha." Sliding into the passenger seat, I watched as Grayson started the engine with that predatory grace of his.

The moment we hit the private road, his hand slid up my thigh. "What are you— oh!"

His fingers didn't hesitate, slipping beneath my skirt with practiced ease. My legs parted instinctively as my hands scrambled for purchase on the window and his shoulder.

"No more underwear. Ever." His gaze burned into me.

"Grayson! The road—" Pleasure coiled tight, but he wasn't even touching me properly yet, just teasing with maddening circles of his thumb.

"What about it?"

"Oh gods—" I could feel slickness coating the leather seat beneath me. As our territory gates came into view, the guards' silhouettes made my breath hitch. "GRAYSON!"

The gates swung open at our approach. "Don't you dare come yet." His command was guttural.

Tremors wracked my body as we pulled up to the pack house in the predawn stillness. Grayson hauled me onto his lap without removing his hand, carrying me through the silent halls.

"Someone might see—" My protest dissolved into a moan against his neck.

"So fucking wet for me." His teeth grazed my pulse point.

I bit into his shoulder to stifle my cries as we ascended the stairs, his fingers never ceasing their relentless rhythm. "Need to— need—" My fists twisted in his shirt as pleasure crested.

###Chapter 0334

"Not now!" Grayson's voice was rough with desire. Before I could react, the bedroom door slammed shut. His fingers withdrew from me abruptly, leaving me sprawled across the mattress.

My protest died in my throat as Grayson tore at my clothes with single-minded intensity. Fabric ripped. My blouse and skirt became scraps on the floor. Only my bra remained when his pants joined the pile of discarded clothing.

He entered me without warning.

"Eyes on me!" he commanded. I hadn't realized they'd closed. His movements were deeper, more deliberate than ever before - each thrust like ocean waves crashing against the shore.

Then everything changed.

Grayson flipped me over with startling speed. His hands gripped my hips, lifting me into position. The new angle sent unfamiliar sensations coursing through me.

"GRAYSON!" My scream echoed off the walls as pleasure built to unbearable intensity.

"Not yet." He withdrew completely. I whimpered in protest, but his tongue traced a devastating path that left me gasping.

My arms collapsed as he worked his magic. When his mouth closed over my most sensitive spot, my climax hit with shocking force.

Grayson didn't pause. The moment my body stopped trembling, he was inside me again. Three powerful thrusts later, his release came with a primal growl. Exhausted, I faceplanted into the pillows. He collapsed beside me, but I was already unconscious.

Morning light filtered through the curtains when I awoke to an empty bed. A folded note rested on Grayson's pillow:

My Princess,

You looked too peaceful to disturb. I'm training with the guards and checking security protocols. Evelyn will collect you at 9am to review event center decorations. Rest today - I'll drive us to the ceremony tonight.

All my love,
Grayson

This tender side of my mate still surprised me. I traced the words with my fingertips, smiling uncontrollably. The clock read 8:17am - just enough time for a quick rinse. Last night's activities definitely required freshening up.

"Good morning, beautiful." Grayson's voice whispered through our bond.

"Morning. Thank you for the note."

"Did it make you smile?"

"Like an idiot."

"Perfect. How are you feeling?"

"Good. Excited." I turned off the shower, reaching for a towel. "About last night..."

I felt his apprehension before he spoke. "Was it too much?"

"I loved it." Heat crept up my neck at the admission. "It was... new."

"Good new or bad new?"

"Very good new." I pulled on a tank top and shorts, twisting my damp hair into a messy bun. "Different sensations."

"Mm. I've got to go. Take it easy today." His mental voice sounded distracted.

"Will do. Bye!" I severed the connection and headed downstairs.

Evelyn stood by the front door chatting with Cassandra. Both women turned as I approached.

"Ready to decorate?" Evelyn grinned.

"Apparently Grayson thinks I need an escort," I teased.

"I'm coming too!" Cassandra announced brightly. My stomach dropped. I shot Evelyn a panicked look.

###Chapter 0335

Awkward didn't even begin to describe the morning. Every time I glanced at Cassandra, guilt twisted in my gut. She was actually being helpful—decorating, solving problems, even laughing with the others. I desperately needed there to be a simple explanation for all this.

It wasn’t that I feared confrontation. But for Nathan’s sake—for our friendship—I couldn’t just blurt out my suspicions. And Grayson? I had no idea when he planned to address it. Before prom? Unlikely. He’d said he’d see me when we left. Maybe tomorrow.

Lost in thought, I barely registered the searing pain until it shot through my fingers.

"You okay?" Grayson’s voice echoed through the mind-link.

"Yeah, just burned myself. No big deal."

"Princess, you’re not supposed to touch hot things." His teasing tone made me roll my eyes.

"Wow, really? I’m curling my hair. We just got back, and I started getting ready. Got distracted."

"By what?" He grunted, like he was moving something heavy.

"Today went… surprisingly well. Cassandra came along. I forgot she was coming, so I was a little off around her."

"Did you say anything?" His voice was carefully neutral.

"No. She was actually great—super helpful."

"Nathan said she’s excited for prom."

"Are you getting ready? We leave in an hour."

"Heading there now. Figured your stuff would be everywhere."

I glanced at the disaster of my vanity. "It’s not everywhere."

"Sure." He laughed. "See you soon."

The link stayed open, faintly humming in the back of my mind. If I focused, I could probably eavesdrop, but that felt invasive.

Once my curls were pinned up, I moved to makeup. The dress I’d picked months ago—before the pregnancy—was a gamble now. Black rhinestones hugged every curve, plunging into a deep V-neckline edged with delicate lace. The blush underskirt faded into an ombré shimmer, the train catching light with every movement.

I kept my makeup simple—smoky eyes, winged liner—then freed my hair, loosely pinning back the top into a fishtail braid. A few face-framing strands and rhinestone bobby pins finished the look.

The sticky bra barely contained my swollen chest. And since Grayson seemed very appreciative of me going commando lately, I skipped underwear entirely. The dress clung to my growing bump, the fabric snug but not uncomfortable.

A knock.

Assuming Grayson, I called, "Come in!"

The door creaked open.

Cassandra stood there, eyes sweeping over me. "You look… stunning."

"Thanks." I adjusted the necklace Grayson had given me—the one with the tiny wolf charm.

She hesitated, then held out a small velvet box. "I thought you might want these."

Inside were a pair of delicate diamond earrings.

My breath caught. "What’s this for?"

She smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. "Consider it an apology."

For what?

The question hung between us, unspoken.

###Chapter 0336

"The only thing I have left from my past." Vivienne smiled warmly as she extended the small velvet box toward me.

"Princess! Are you— Vivienne?" Grayson strode into the room, his grin vanishing the moment his eyes landed on her.

"I wanted to give Audrey something special," Vivienne explained softly.

"What is it?" I asked, accepting the delicate box. Grayson moved beside me, his presence protective.

"I cut a tiny slit in the rags they forced me to wear and hid these inside. They were my mother’s earrings. Damian took everything else, but I managed to save these before they could steal them too."

I lifted the lid, revealing a pair of stunning earrings—a black onyx stone encircled by a halo of diamonds. "You hid these in your clothes?" Grayson asked, disbelief coloring his tone.

"Yes. The nurses can confirm—I refused to let them destroy the rags. I waited for the right moment to give them to you."

"They're breathtaking," I murmured, at a loss for words.

"They’ll complement your dress perfectly, but if you’d rather not wear them, I understand." Vivienne fidgeted nervously.

"Of course I’ll wear them." Grayson took the box so I could fasten them on. "How do they look?" I turned toward the mirror.

The reflection staring back was unrecognizable—elegant, radiant. "Stunning," Grayson murmured, stepping behind me.

He was dressed impeccably—black slacks, a crisp white shirt, and a tie knotted snugly at his throat. His sleeves were rolled up, revealing strong forearms, and his dark hair was slicked back, his stubble adding a rugged edge.

"You two make a gorgeous couple!" Vivienne clapped her hands together.

"Just need my shoes, and I’m ready." Smiling at her, I slipped into my black strappy heels, my nails painted black to match.

"All set?" Grayson checked his watch.

"Ready. Are Nathan and Cassandra riding with us?"

"No, they’re taking their own car. Just in case we want to leave at different times." His gaze kept drifting lower, lingering on my cleavage rather than meeting my eyes.

"Well, you two have fun!" Vivienne headed for the door.

"Thank you, Vivienne. These earrings are exquisite. Are you absolutely sure you want me to have them?"

"More than sure. I’ve waited years for this moment." She gave me one last warm smile before leaving.

"Alright, let’s go." I took a step toward the door.

"Not so fast." Grayson grabbed my arm, spinning me around until I collided with his chest. "You look fucking irresistible," he growled, tangling his fingers in my hair and crushing his lips to mine.

I could feel the hard press of his arousal against me.

"You’ll have to wait until after, Alpha. I spent too much time on this look for you to ruin it."

"That’s why we’re driving separately," he rumbled, palming my ass.

We left our room and descended to the garage, where pack members milled about, dressed up and waiting for their dates. Grayson had brought out his matte-black Lamborghini for the occasion—sleek, powerful, just like him.

"I have to admit, I’m excited for tonight," I said as we stepped outside.

"Any night I get to have you on my arm is a good night," he replied. "Though you’re making it hard to focus with that dress."

"I bought this before the pregnancy. It’s a little… revealing."

"You’re making it impossible not to take you right here." He adjusted himself with a grimace.

"Let me help." Smirking, I reached over and tugged his zipper down just enough—

His cock sprang free, nearly hitting my chin.

"Fuck," Grayson groaned as my lips wrapped around him. His grip on my hip tightened as I worked him faster, teasing him with light licks and slow drags of my tongue.

Just when he was on the edge, I pulled back, blowing cool air over his heated skin. His growl was feral as he finally spilled down my throat.

###Chapter 0337

"Feeling better?" I asked, sitting up and deliberately wiping my lips.

"Just more frustrated," Grayson groaned as he adjusted himself. Unfortunately for him, we were already pulling into the event center.

"You'll have to wait until later," I teased, smirking at him as he parked the car.

"Sooner than you think, princess," he promised darkly, stepping out of the car. He came around to open my door, offering his hand. I took it, stepping into the warm summer night breeze.

"Beautiful evening," I remarked as he joined me.

"You look incredible," Grayson murmured, pulling me against him.

"Glad you approve. You don’t look half bad yourself." I stopped him, watching as confusion flickered across his face. Gripping his tie, I gave him a slow, seductive smirk before yanking him toward me. My arms wound around his neck as I kissed him hard. He didn’t disappoint—his hands immediately found my waist, pulling me closer.

"Get a room, you two!" Evelyn’s voice echoed across the parking lot.

Breaking the kiss, Grayson reluctantly let me go, his expression stormy.

"You look amazing!" I said, admiring Evelyn’s dress—a sleek black number with daring cutouts that accentuated her curves. It was the kind of figure I envied.

"Your tits are unreal," Evelyn pointed out bluntly.

"They’re a little much," I admitted, feeling heat rise to my cheeks.

"Nope, they’re perfect," Grayson countered.

Sebastian and Nathan exchanged a knowing look before shaking hands.

"Is Sophia coming?" I asked.

"She is," Evelyn said, her expression shifting as Sebastian shook his head.

"Pregnancy troubles?" I guessed as we walked toward the entrance.

"She’s so close to her due date and miserable. Oliver wanted to stay home with her, but she refused. She looks good, but he’s terrified this might send her into early labor."

"Is Oliver fully healed?" I asked.

"Yeah, back to normal. Still has a bit of a limp, but he’s ready for the baby," Sebastian answered for the first time.

"Any pregnancy symptoms for you?" I turned to Evelyn.

"Just cravings. Anything chocolate is fair game."

"Chocolate-covered pickles with nuts," Sebastian added with a nod.

"That sounds disgusting," Grayson fake-gagged.

"Don’t knock it till you try it," Evelyn shot back.

"I did. It was not good," Sebastian confirmed, earning a playful shove from Evelyn. He just smirked and draped an arm over her shoulders.

"What about you?" Evelyn asked me.

"I just need to sit down. Not nauseous, but standing feels like too much effort."

I wasn’t about to tell Grayson’s sister that I couldn’t keep my hands off her brother.

"Let’s keep it light," Sebastian sighed. "Poor bastard."

Following his gaze, I saw a car pull up. Oliver helped Sophia out before going to park. She was huge but radiant in a baby-blue dress that flowed to her knees, the back cascading to her ankles. Wisely, she’d skipped the heels.

"Hey, girl! You look gorgeous!" I said, trying to be supportive.

"Not sure why I picked blue. I look like a whale that got stung by a bee and had an allergic reaction."

That was… quite the visual. "I think you look stunning," I corrected.

"There’s Cassandra and Nathan," Sophia sighed. "I’m ready for food."

Evelyn and I exchanged amused glances as they approached.

"Look at Nathan cleaning up nice!"

"It happens occasionally," Nathan quipped, adjusting his tie.

"Ready to head in?" Oliver jogged up the steps to join us.

"Yes! Let’s go!"

###Chapter 0338

The moment we stepped inside, thunderous applause erupted. The venue was packed with people. Strategically dimmed lights made our handcrafted decorations glow brilliantly against the darkened space. Sapphire and platinum chiffon cascaded from the ceiling like liquid starlight. Our DIY mason jar chandelier twinkled overhead, adorned with oversized faux diamonds that refracted light across the dancefloor. The DJ booth hummed with energy on the left while catering staff stood at attention on the right.

As we located our seats, Evelyn and Grayson approached the microphone. "Thank you all for joining us tonight!" Evelyn beamed, her smile radiant enough to challenge the chandelier. The crowd's deafening cheers made my ears ring.

Grayson raised his hand for silence after the initial uproar. "After everything we've been through, tonight is about celebration." His voice carried effortlessly across the room. "Since we missed our official prom, consider this our gift to you all." Another wave of applause nearly drowned him out. "Special recognition goes to the incredible women who made this happen. Evelyn and Audrey spent weeks planning every detail. With Cassandra and Sophia's help, they've created magic tonight."

Wolf-whistles and cheers bounced off the walls. "Now let's eat, drink, and make unforgettable memories!" Evelyn had to shout over the noise. The moment we settled, servers began circulating with silver-domed platters.

Our table arrangement placed Evelyn and me at center stage - Grayson flanking my right, Sebastian on my left. Oliver sat beside Sebastian with Sophia at the end, while Nathan anchored Grayson's other side with Cassandra completing the circle. My mouth watered as servers revealed perfectly seared duck breast atop jasmine rice with seasonal vegetables.

Conversation and laughter flowed as music filled the air. "This turnout exceeded all expectations," Evelyn murmured to me between bites.

"Absolutely! I can't wait to hit the dancefloor." I'd barely finished half my plate before pushing it aside in anticipation.

"Halloween came early!" Evelyn started swaying to the music still seated, making Sebastian arch an eyebrow in that infuriatingly controlled way of his. He lounged back, watching her with that intense gaze that never revealed anything.

"How's the warriors' training progressing?" Grayson asked Sebastian, leaning back casually.

"No shop talk!" Evelyn brandished her butter knife like a sword, narrowing her eyes playfully.

The DJ's voice boomed through the speakers. "May I present Alpha Grayson and Alpha Sebastian with their Lunas for the first dance?"

"Thrilling," Sebastian deadpanned as Evelyn dragged him up. Grayson extended his hand to me with that heart-stopping smile.

Grayson's POV

Spinning my breathtaking mate before pulling her flush against me for this obligatory first dance. Her radiant smile could power cities as her arms looped around my neck. When "Strawberry Wine" began playing, I drowned in her eyes.

"Enjoying yourself?" I murmured as we swayed. Our faces were already close when she deliberately closed the distance further, our foreheads touching.

Suddenly, she fisted my tie and yanked me down to whisper: "No panties tonight."

Holy hell. This woman would be the death of me. She always had this effect on me, but tonight she'd dialed it to eleven. My hand hovered dangerously close to her backside when she dropped that bombshell. Every fiber of my being screamed to grab handfuls of that perfect ass, but I somehow maintained control.

"Damn, woman." My voice came out rougher than intended, but the goosebumps rising on her arms told me she liked it.

"You're the one who banned panties," she teased, clearly proud of herself.

"Never thought you'd actually obey," I growled, wrestling my wolf back under control.

"Why's that?" Genuine confusion flickered across her features.

I pulled her closer, our dance becoming more intimate than appropriate for public. "Because you're everything pure and good in this world. The most compassionate soul I've ever known. In my wildest dreams, I never imagined being worthy of someone like you. You've always been modest - never flaunting that incredible body of yours. As much as I adore that about you, I never expected you'd feel comfortable in this dress... like this... in public. Hell, you won't even wear lingerie for me privately. So tell me, why the sudden change?"

###Chapter 0339

I watched my words sink in. The hurt in her eyes mirrored my own emotions. "I—"

"Audrey, I love modest Audrey. I love this Audrey." My finger traced a path down her chest. "You always drive me wild. But I never want you to do anything you're not comfortable with. I've been pushing you lately, and I need to know you're okay. Nothing matters more than your happiness." Cradling her face, I tilted it up, forcing her to meet my gaze.

"I want to keep exploring this," she said without hesitation. I crushed my lips against hers, barely registering the cheers around us. For a moment, I forgot we were even dancing.

"Let's get this party started!" the DJ shouted, and Taylor Swift's Shake It Off blasted through the speakers. Evelyn grabbed Audrey, and they joined a group of girls on the dance floor. Grayson and I made our way over to Oliver and Nathan, who were lingering near the edge.

"Here." Nathan handed me a glass of whiskey.

"I thought this was a dry event," I muttered but downed it anyway.

"Since when has prom ever been alcohol-free?" Nathan laughed, his grin reminding me why I still questioned his maturity.

"Where's Sophia?" I asked Oliver.

"Over there." He nodded toward a table where a cluster of pack members surrounded her like she'd been gone for years.

"Any day now," Nathan teased.

"Not complaining," Oliver murmured, his eyes never leaving Sophia as she laughed.

"You two stay alert. Grayson and I will be right back," Sebastian said, setting his glass down.

"Got it," Oliver replied, still watching Sophia.

I followed Sebastian outside. "What's going on?"

"Three girls just ran up to my security team. They're half-naked and bleeding."

"Damn it." If Xavier was involved, I was going to strangle him.

"Yep."

We walked a few hundred yards into the treeline. "Alpha," a warrior greeted, stepping aside. Five armed warriors stood guard, all dressed formally but armed to the teeth. Sebastian wasn't taking any chances.

As they parted, three girls came into view—huddled together, shaking, their bodies covered in bruises and fresh cuts. Dirt and blood made it impossible to tell their hair color or even their ethnicity.

"What happened?" Sebastian demanded.

"These women asked for sanctuary," a warrior explained.

"They're after us!" the first girl sobbed.

"You have to help us!" the second pleaded.

"He said you would!" The third girl looked barely twelve.

"Who did?" I asked.

"Xavier. H-he told us you'd protect us."

Silence fell as my mind raced. I still hadn't heard Giselle's full story, and now three more girls showed up? What did he think my pack was? He knew I wouldn't turn them away, but damn him for putting me in this position.

"What happened tonight?" I asked.

"Xavier smuggled us out of where we were being held. We were slaves to different men. He wasn't kind, but he didn't... hurt us. A fight broke out in the camp, and Xavier grabbed us. At first, I thought he was kidnapping us too. The others thought the same, so they chased us." The first girl spoke without looking up.

"When we were driving away, they rammed us, and we went off a bridge. Xavier was trapped, but we got out. He told us to run and not look back, so we did."

"Did Xavier tell you about this place?" Sebastian asked, a question that confused me, but I stayed silent.

"Yes. He said someone named Grayson was here and could help us."

"Xavier was stuck? In the car?" I pressed.

"Yes. I don't know if he got out or if the bad men found him," the second girl whispered.

"Are you Grayson? Are you going to kill us?" The youngest girl eyed the warriors' guns fearfully.

###Chapter 0340

"No, we won't harm you." My voice came out softer than intended, uncertainty gripping me.

"How many were pursuing you?" Sebastian's question cut through the tense air.

"I-I don't know." The youngest girl's tears carved clean streaks through the grime on her cheeks.

"Sebastian." I murmured, stepping away from the trembling trio.

"We can't abandon Xavier..." Sebastian began.

"It would simplify things..." The thought wasn't entirely unwelcome. Xavier had become a persistent thorn in my side.

"Audrey wouldn't approve, I imagine."

"Damn right." I exhaled sharply. "Fine. Have a warrior escort these girls to our pack for cleaning up. We need to locate Xavier. Tomorrow we'll question all four for details." The thought of leaving Audrey stung. She'd been so looking forward to this evening.

"Evelyn won't be pleased," Sebastian remarked as we turned back toward the celebration. Glancing over my shoulder, I saw three warriors gently guiding the disheveled girls toward the parking area.

"Neither will Audrey."

The party's energy hit us like a wall when we reentered. The scene remained unchanged - Oliver and Nathan roaring with laughter, Sophia deep in conversation with a group of girls, while Evelyn and Audrey stood center stage.

"I'll retrieve them," Sebastian offered. My earlier joy had evaporated, replaced by simmering irritation.

Audrey approached with a fresh sheen of perspiration glistening on her forehead. "Let's step outside," I suggested, taking her hand.

"Ooo! What surprise do you boys have planned?" Evelyn gushed with exaggerated excitement.

The warm night air embraced us as we moved to a secluded spot. "Why do you feel both guilty and angry?" Audrey's voice carried an unusual detachment.

"This isn't actually a surprise, is it?" Evelyn's tone shifted as the girls stood shoulder-to-shoulder facing us. The rapid dissolution of hope in their expressions twisted something in my chest.

After an extended silence, Audrey finally broke it. "What's happened?"

"Three girls stumbled into our warriors earlier," Sebastian began. "They were in tattered clothes, completely filthy."

"Are they alright?" Audrey's question wavered.

"Physically unharmed. Though they were fleeing pursuers," Sebastian explained.

"Who was chasing them?" Evelyn demanded.

"They didn't know. Only that their holding camp erupted into violence. They escaped during the chaos, but their vehicle crashed. The driver became trapped while they heard approaching footsteps, so they ran." Sebastian continued, but Audrey's gaze locked onto mine.

"The driver...?" Audrey's whisper barely reached my ears.

"Xavier." My confirmation made her eyelids flutter shut.

"Is he alive?" Evelyn asked as Audrey's head bowed.

"Unknown. We only know he was trapped when they fled." My answer went to Evelyn, but my focus remained on Audrey.

"Will you go after him?" Evelyn composed herself enough to ask.

Our silence stretched until Audrey lifted her head, meeting my eyes with a solemn nod.

"We'll return as quickly as possible." Audrey stepped into my embrace.

"Please save him." Her whispered plea reached both Sebastian and Evelyn despite its softness. Resting my chin atop her head, I observed their reactions - Evelyn's eyes brimming with sympathy for Audrey, Sebastian maintaining his usual impassive expression.

"We'll move heaven and earth to bring him back," I vowed, gazing down at her.

"Come, Audrey. The men will handle this. Let's return to the party and try to enjoy ourselves. Xavier's too stubborn to die anyway." Evelyn took Audrey's hand, leading her back toward the festivities.

'Thank you,' I mouthed to Evelyn before she turned away.

"Let's get this over with," Sebastian declared, clapping my shoulder as he strode forward.

###Chapter 0341

"I might just end him myself," I muttered as we stepped into the dense forest.

Sebastian let out a dry chuckle. "Now that's a thought. Then you can be the one stuck babysitting him."

"Piss off," I shot back, earning a rare laugh from him.

"That slimy bastard might actually be useful—assuming he survives this," Sebastian mused.

"So far, all he's done is rescue girls. Not once has he bothered to update me, warn me of threats, or even check in. All I know is he keeps ending up in shady situations."

Sebastian shrugged. "Saving them wasn't exactly a bad thing."

"Oh, so you're a fan now? Great. He can move to your pack, and you can deal with him."

"Hard pass. Your sister keeps me busy enough." His tone turned serious.

"Not even a little sorry for you," I said flatly. I'd endured eighteen years of that chaos—now it was his turn.

"Clearly," he replied, leaving it at that.

The deeper we ventured, the quieter we became. The girls hadn’t gone far, and the highway loomed to our left. If Xavier was still in the city’s underbelly, he’d be right where we were heading.

The brush thickened, and the blare of a horn grew louder. Sebastian and I moved like shadows, barely making a sound. A thin trail of smoke curled through the trees ahead.

The impact had shattered a trunk.

Sebastian’s phone lit up as we crept closer. Whatever it was, it must’ve been urgent—he answered but stayed silent. After a beat, he hung up and started texting. Seconds later, my pocket buzzed.

The scent of wolves hung heavy in the air. Too heavy. Were they still nearby?

Sebastian approached the passenger side while I took the driver’s door. I braced myself for a corpse—but instead, all I saw was blood.

Pulling out my phone, I read Sebastian’s message:

Sophia’s water just broke.

Xavier’s POV

Goddammit. My skull was splitting. The sharp agony in my shoulder told me it was dislocated. Blood trickled down my face as I forced my eyes open.

"Is—is he alive?" one of the girls whispered. Her timid voice grated on my nerves.

"Yes! Get up! They're coming!" Another one nudged my arm.

"F*ck!" I snarled, trying to move. My foot was trapped, and the roar of engines grew louder. "Run! Straight ahead—ask for Grayson."

"Grayson? Why can’t you come?" the timid one whined.

"Just go! He’ll protect you. Move!" I barked.

They bolted. They had maybe a minute before headlights would flood the wreckage.

Playing dead wasn’t an option. Neither was being taken hostage.

She was the only reason I kept fighting. My whole life had been about keeping Audrey alive. Now she had Grayson, and my mission was Vivienne. Still, if I could save my daughter again, both Vivienne and I would gladly die for it.

"Come out and play, dirtbag!"

I was still shaking off the fog from the crash—one I couldn’t even remember happening.

"There he is." A blinding flashlight beam hit me. "Where are the girls?"

"Busy with your mom," I spat, leaning back against the seat.

"You think you're funny?" A fist yanked me by the hair, dragging me out—but my foot stayed lodged. Letting go, he grabbed my leg and wrenched hard. My ankle popped free before snapping back into place.

###Chapter 0342

"SON OF A BITCH!" The punch landed square on my mouth, sending a sharp jolt of pain across my face. The metallic taste of blood flooded my tongue as dirt clogged my nostrils.

"Where are they, Xavier?" That voice alone made my blood run cold.

"Magnus. What a pleasant surprise." I grinned up at him, despite the throbbing in my jaw. He was dressed impeccably, as if he'd just stepped out of a high-society event.

"Wish I could say the same." Magnus crouched down, his cold eyes level with mine. "You've been a persistent little pest, haven't you?"

"What can I say?" I shrugged, trying to shift into a less vulnerable position. "Even rats know how to survive."

"Rats deserve to be exterminated." One of the rogues beside him sneered. There was something unhinged in his gaze—a reckless bloodlust that made him unpredictable.

"Funny. I've seen rats survive worse." I shot back.

"Enough. Move out." Magnus snapped his fingers, and two pairs of rough hands yanked me to my feet. He strode ahead while they dragged me behind him like a sack of garbage.

Every instinct screamed that wherever they were taking me, I didn’t want to go. Men like me don’t live this long by walking blindly into traps. But I had one shot. Three rogues. Magnus. That’s all I could see—two dragging me, one flanking my right, and Magnus leading the way.

My ankle screamed in protest, and my shoulder was still dislocated. I’d endured worse. Much worse. And I’d still escaped.

Twenty miles from here was an old hunting shed—my safe house. More than once, it had been my salvation. Beneath its rotting floorboards lay an old bomb shelter, a place even the most determined hunters had never found.

This was my moment. Magnus was distracted, barking orders into his phone, far enough ahead that he was nearly out of sight. The rogues were lax, their grips loose.

Like stealing candy from a child.

I twisted violently, throwing them off balance. The second my claws extended, I slashed across the nearest rogue’s throat. Blood sprayed hot across my face as another grabbed me from behind.

Instinct took over. My head snapped back, crunching into his nose. Then I ran.

"GET HIM!" The shout echoed behind me.

This? This was exhilarating. My laughter rang through the trees as I pushed forward, my wolf surging beneath my skin.

Age hadn’t slowed me. My wolf was still the fastest thing in these woods, and these trees knew me better than my own reflection.

The hunting horn faded. The footsteps died out. I didn’t slow down.

A furious roar sent birds scattering into the sky. "Go to hell, Magnus," I muttered, sparing only a glance at the fleeing birds before pressing on.

My lungs burned as I finally paused, just for a second. My arm hung uselessly—I needed to reset it. The pain was familiar, but that didn’t make it any less excruciating. Teeth clenched, I jerked it back into place with a sickening pop.

No time to dwell. The second the worst of the pain passed, I was running again.

But as I neared the safe house, dread coiled in my gut. Something was wrong.

The last mile, I moved like a ghost—silent, deliberate. Every step was measured. Then I saw it.

"Place is empty, boss." The sound of splintering wood reached my ears.

Peering through the underbrush, I realized—

I’d been made.

###Chapter 0343

The moonlight cast eerie shadows across my front yard as I spotted Raphael standing there, a cigar dangling between his fingers. The glow of the ember illuminated his cruel smirk.

"Didn't think I'd find you so easily." His voice was like gravel underfoot.

My nostrils flared. These weren't rogues. These were trained warriors - Silvercrest Pack members who'd sworn allegiance to Raphael and Magnus.

"Burn it down," Raphael commanded with a casual flick of his wrist.

One of his men grinned, gathering dry twigs and leaves. The lighter's flame danced briefly before catching. They placed the burning bundle against the rotting corner of my safehouse.

Within minutes, flames licked up the wooden walls. The heat warmed my face as I watched my sanctuary turn to ashes. Raphael yawned dramatically.

"Let's move out."

The fire inside me burned hotter than the one consuming my home. As they walked away, I followed silently. Wrapping my hands around Raphael's throat would be satisfying, but pointless. No, I needed information first.

Their movements were unnaturally quiet for such young wolves. Years of hiding had made me an expert at stealth, but these warriors moved like shadows. All except one - a dark-haired male who kept glancing at the stars, pausing whenever the tree cover broke.

"Headquarters by seven. Not a minute later." Raphael's command cut through the night before he disappeared into the tree line.

Three vintage cars waited on the overgrown service road. I'd known about this hidden route, but never imagined others did too. If Raphael knew... who else was watching me?



"Yes, boss." Their voices synchronized perfectly.

Raphael took the lead car while the others dispersed. My target - the star-gazing warrior - climbed into a beat-up sedan alone. Perfect.

I stripped quickly, shifting mid-stride as engines roared to life. My wolf form wasn't imposing, but speed was our gift. Light brown fur with dark speckles provided perfect forest camouflage. Many called my wolf abnormal, but his ability to vanish into surroundings had saved me countless times.

Chasing a car wasn't easy, even for us. I had to weave through trees, keeping parallel to the road but never exposing myself. The sedan headed toward what humans might call a slum, but we knew it as the Den - lawless territory where underground fight clubs, trafficking rings, and drug dens operated in uneasy truce. One bar served as neutral ground. Cause trouble there, and you didn't walk out. Simple.

The car stopped before a crumbling Victorian manor they called Rosewood. Vines strangled the peeling walls; dead flowers wilted on the porch. Shifting back, I watched my target enter the decaying house.

Now came the hardest part - waiting for sleep to claim him.

###Chapter 0344
Xavier POV

Three hours later, the man was sprawled unconscious on his couch. Through the window, I watched him drain an entire twelve-pack before snorting a thin white line. His head finally lolled back, and he was out.

I slipped around to the back door. The wood was so rotted that one solid hip-check shattered it into splinters. I froze, listening for movement. Silence. I stepped inside.

The place was a disaster. The sink overflowed with dirty dishes. A thick layer of dust coated the floor, preserving my footprints like fresh snow. Mice scurried boldly across the room, unbothered by my presence.

Peeking around the corner, I confirmed the guy hadn’t moved. Too easy. He was still dead to the world, but since my gear had burned up, I needed rope—or anything to restrain him.

The hallway stretched to my right. First door on the left: a bathroom. Razors, blackened spoons, and needles littered the counter beside a shoelace. But my gaze locked onto a small nasal spray. A grin spread across my face as I pocketed the Narcan. Maybe this dump would make a decent hideout after I finished with him.

Then I entered the bedroom—and froze.

How had I missed the stench?

A naked man was tied to the bed, long dead. Judging by the rigor mortis, he’d been gone at least twelve hours, maybe twenty-four.

"Sorry, but I need these," I muttered, untying him. Four ropes, plus a ball gag.

A quick search turned up a knife and a 9mm with a full clip. I grabbed a fresh box of ammo too before scanning the room one last time.

No way was I carrying him. I snatched the car keys from the table by the door and tossed my bag into the trunk.

Dragging a deadweight that size would be a nightmare, but I had a plan. I gripped one leg and hauled him like a sack of flour. His head thumped against the pavement, then the car’s edge, before I finally shoved him into the trunk.

"Thank God for drugs," I muttered, slamming it shut.

Back at my burned-out house, I groaned. No chair meant I had to wrestle him out and tie him to a tree. Dead weight was the worst.

Sweat beaded on my forehead as I caught my breath. Too old for this shit.

"Rise and shine," I said cheerfully, administering the Narcan.

His eyes flew open, darting around wildly. "Wha—?" He struggled against the ropes before glaring at me. "What the hell?"

"Hello," I said, crouching to his level.

"You." His voice dripped with venom.

"Ah, yes. Me." I spread my arms in mock celebration.

"What do you want?" His gaze tracked the knife in my hand.

"Answers."

"I don’t have any. I just follow orders." His jaw clenched, but he didn’t look away from the blade.

###Chapter 0345

"You might want to find those answers fast." I stepped closer, my voice low and deliberate. Kneeling beside him, I sliced through his shirt with the blade. "Why are Magnus and Raphael after Audrey?"

"She's just paying for your mistakes, old man." My fingers closed around his nipple, the knife glinting as I began to carve. His screams tore through the air, but the forest remained indifferent. Even the birds didn’t stir.

"Seraphina said she stole something from them." I continued, holding the severed flesh between my fingers.

"Stupid bitch. Just kill that parasite already."

"Not a fan of the boss’s mate?" I tilted my head.

"I don’t like anyone." His breaths grew shallower.

"I won’t ask again. What’s Audrey’s role in this?"

"I. Don’t. Know!" He spat through gritted teeth.

A sigh escaped me. Time for the other one. "You know how many nerve endings are in a nipple? Hundreds. All exposed." My tone was eerily calm, almost bored.

He thrashed, but my grip was unyielding. "FUCK!"

"I didn’t pick this spot to sleep out of convenience." Rising, I strode toward a piece of wood I’d placed earlier. Using a nearby stick, I lifted it, a smirk curling my lips.

"What’s there?" he demanded, panic lacing his voice.

I bent down and retrieved it.



"Know what this is?" I dropped the board, letting him see the creature up close.

"A damn snake."

"Not just any snake. A Coral Snake. Its venom attacks the nervous system before death." I held it inches from his face, letting the fear sink in.

"One bite, and you’ll beg for death."

"I’ll take my chances."

"Okay." I pressed the snake against his raw flesh. It struck instantly.

"HOLY SHIT!" His body convulsed as venom flooded his veins.

"Good boy." I returned the snake to its hiding place.

Sweat drenched him. I picked up a stick and began carving as the poison worked its way through him. "Tell me when you’re ready to talk."

Twenty minutes passed before he gasped, "Just kill me."

"Tell me what I want to know." My carving was nearly finished—my signature. If his death wasn’t message enough, this would be.

"Magnus is pissed the title didn’t go to him. He didn’t even know Audrey existed. That shocked all of us. Raphael just wants him to challenge her, but Magnus wants blood. That’s all I know." Blood bubbled from his lips.

The venom shouldn’t have worked this fast, but fate had other plans. "He just wants the title?"



"Yes! Now kill me!" His scream choked off as blood filled his throat. Moments later, his head lolled to the side.

"Shit." I needed Magnus to back off. Since Audrey had given the title to Grayson, I had to protect her. She was my priority. Grayson wouldn’t like this, but I didn’t care.

I carved into his chest: Alpha Grayson of Nightshade. Ran out of space, but it would do. Maybe Magnus would focus on Grayson and leave Audrey alone. She was just the Luna—if Grayson lost, she could reject Magnus. I’d keep her safe.

As I headed toward Grayson’s territory, my mind raced. Grayson had an ancient wolf. He could kill Magnus. It was the best plan. Let Grayson fight and win. Then, dealing with Magnus and Raphael would be easy.

The border was in sight when rustling snapped my attention. I ducked behind a tree. A young woman sprinted past, glancing over her shoulder in terror.

Curiosity won. I changed course, tailing her. At first, I thought she was fleeing—but no. She was running toward someone, ensuring she wasn’t followed.

###Chapter 0346

The night was alive with energy, but dawn was creeping closer. Sunday morning approached fast, and the woman beside me radiated both excitement and fear.

We walked for what felt like miles before I realized where we were heading. Part of me wanted to warn her—she was walking straight into the lion's den. But her steps never faltered, her pace steady as she jogged forward with determination.

I hung back, too far to hear their words, but close enough to watch as she stepped into Magnus’s arms.

My jaw dropped when he pulled her into a fierce kiss before slamming the door shut behind them. Taking a risk, I crept toward the window, relieved to find it slightly ajar.

“Why did you come?” Magnus demanded, his voice low.

“I had to see you.”

“I know. I miss you too. But if we’re caught, everything falls apart.”

“You’re my mate,” she whispered, tears welling in her eyes. “Why can’t we just be together?”

Magnus turned away, his shoulders tense. “I’ve told you why. For one, Grayson would never allow it. I’m not a good man.”

“You could be,” she insisted. “Let me help you.”

“Did you do what I asked?” His gaze sharpened.

“N-not yet. I’ve tried, but I haven’t found anything.”

His expression darkened. “If you fail, he’ll kill you. You can’t fail.” The urgency in his voice betrayed his concern.

“What does he expect me to do? They’re not weak wolves.”

“Audrey is just a Luna, and a soft one at that,” Magnus scoffed.

“No, she’s not.” The girl frowned.

Magnus narrowed his eyes. “What do you mean?”

“Audrey never gave up her title. They’re both Alphas. I overheard them talking. Yes, they merged the packs, but she kept her rank.”

My stomach twisted. I’d made a terrible mistake. My thoughts immediately flew to the man who was probably being torn apart right now. I had to reach him before it was too late. Outside, the first rays of sunlight pierced through the trees.

“This is perfect,” Magnus murmured, a spark of excitement in his voice. “Befriend her. Get her to trust you. Find out what we need.”

“I can’t befriend her!” She looked at him like he’d lost his mind. “I’m not cut out for this. I can’t do it.” Tears spilled down her cheeks.

“You have to try,” he insisted, pulling her into a tight embrace. “It’s the only way we get out of this alive.”

“I’ll try,” she whispered, though uncertainty laced her words. “But I don’t know if I can.”

“I’ll keep Raphael off your back as much as I can,” Magnus said firmly. “But he wants blood, and I’ll be damned if it’s yours. If you need to break into Grayson and Audrey’s office, you will do it. Understand?”

She nodded weakly.

“One day,” he murmured, brushing his lips against her forehead, “when this is over, we’ll leave. We’ll be together.”

The clock on the wall struck seven.

“I have to go,” Magnus said abruptly. “There’s a meeting at seven, and the others will wonder where I am. How did you get out?”

“Sophia’s in labor. Her water broke, so everyone’s distracted.”

Magnus grinned. “Perfect. Use the chaos to get into their office.” He grabbed his keys and headed for the door.

“Okay,” she murmured, looking slightly more composed.

“I’ll text you.” He pulled her close, kissing her hard before releasing her.

She watched as he climbed into his car and drove off, then lowered her head and started walking.

“Where are you going?” I stepped out from behind the corner of the house.

Her head snapped up, eyes wide with shock.

###Chapter 0347

"Who are you?" The girl gasped, spinning around so fast she nearly lost her balance. Her eyes widened in recognition. "I—I know you! You're Audrey's father!" She clapped a hand over her mouth and stumbled back a step.

"Correct. And from what I can tell, you're working against her." I took a deliberate step forward, studying her face. Now that I was closer, I recognized her—one of the frequent faces around the pack house.

"What are you doing here?" she demanded, though her voice wavered.

"I could ask you the same thing." Leaning against the porch railing, I pulled out a cigarette. It was slightly crushed, so I had to flick off the broken bits before lighting it.

"What I'm doing here is none of your business!" She tried to sound defiant, but the scent of fear clung to her like perfume.

"Then why ask me the same question?" I exhaled a slow stream of smoke. "Though, I'm sure Grayson would be very interested to know his ex-girlfriend is mated to the man trying to kill his mate."

"We're not trying to kill Audrey!"

"Could've fooled me." I took another drag. "Tell me, what's so important in their office that you're stealing for Lorenzo?"

"Like I said—none of your concern!" She turned sharply, ready to bolt.

In one swift motion, I closed the distance, seized her arm, and twisted it behind her back. "Don't make me break it. Talk, or this won't end well for you."

"I won't—" She gasped as I tightened my grip. "Okay, okay!" Her voice cracked with unshed tears.

"Then start talking." I kept my voice low, my grip unrelenting.



"Lorenzo wants a mold of their office key and the blueprints for the new construction sites."

"That's treason." I wasn't surprised. Lorenzo had always been shortsighted.

"I don’t have a choice! He’ll kill me if I refuse. I don’t want to do this, but I don’t want to die either!"

"Here’s the deal. If you do get into that office, you tell me first. I’ll alter the documents so Lorenzo gets fake layouts. Grayson and Audrey stay safe, and you stay alive."

"You—you’d do that?" She sounded stunned.

Truthfully, I wanted to know why Lorenzo was so desperate for those plans. Did he know something I didn’t?

"Anything to protect my daughter." Omitting my full motives wasn’t a lie—just strategy. She didn’t need to know everything. Pawns rarely did.

"Okay," she whispered. I released her.

"And you can’t tell Magnus about this," I added, feigning concern.

"Why not?"

"What if Lorenzo found out Magnus was betraying him? That wouldn’t end well for him. No, if you want to save Magnus—and yourself—this stays between us. Our little secret."

"To save Magnus…" She sounded like she was struggling to process it.

"Exactly. So you can have a future together."



"Fine. I’ll do it!" She nodded frantically before turning and sprinting away.

It was nearly eight. They’d definitely notice her absence soon. I just had to get there first.

Audrey’s POV

"Did she have the baby yet?" Grayson asked as he strode into our bedroom, sweat glistening from training.

"She did. A little girl—Aurora James." I finished buttoning my blouse as he stripped off his shirt, heading for the shower.

"How’s Sophia doing? The baby okay?"

"She’s exhausted but good. I’ll give her a day before we visit." I grabbed my planner. "School starts next Monday, and the following Saturday is Evelyn’s Luna ceremony. Since Sophia just delivered, Sebastian wants it done quickly. I’m handling invitations today—I’ll be at the shop most of the day. Need to stop by the office first, though."

I pulled on a pair of maternity shorts. My bump was still small, but anything tight felt like torture.

###Chapter 0348

"Are you feeling alright?" Grayson peeked out from the bathroom, his damp hair clinging to his forehead as he studied me. I stood before the full-length mirror, shifting my weight uncomfortably between my feet.

"Everything feels too tight around my stomach. I tried wearing those denim shorts earlier and had to rip them off immediately. Even these new maternity leggings feel wrong somehow."

Grayson stepped out wearing nothing but his boxer briefs, his muscular frame moving with effortless grace as he disappeared into the walk-in closet. "I've been saving something for this exact moment," he called out, his voice muffled by the racks of clothing.

"What is it?" I asked, still mesmerized by the subtle curve of my belly in the mirror.

"Just look." He emerged holding a sleek boutique bag. With an exaggerated eye roll, I reached in and pulled out the softest fabric I'd ever touched. It unfolded into a collection of flowing, bohemian-style maternity dresses - the kind designed to move with your body rather than against it.

"Grayson..." My breath caught as I examined the red and cream striped one with delicate side slits. It had an empire waistline that would accommodate my growing bump perfectly.

"I read three pregnancy books last week," he admitted, scratching the back of his neck. "The warriors' mates all swore by these. Said you can dress them up with jewelry or keep it casual. That one even has hidden pockets."

I shimmied out of my restrictive clothes and let the cool fabric slip over my skin. The difference was instantaneous - like slipping into a second skin made of clouds.

"You've outdone yourself," I whispered, turning to admire the way the dress skimmed over my new curves.

Grayson's golden eyes darkened as he took me in. "Your bump...it's like you grew overnight. You look..." He swallowed hard. "You look radiant."

"You think?" I turned sideways, framing my belly with both hands. The subtle rounding was unmistakable now.

"I can't believe our little miracle is in there." His hand hovered near my stomach before retreating to rub my arms instead.

The hesitation stung. "Why do you do that?"

"Do what?" Genuine confusion wrinkled his brow.

"Pull away from touching my stomach. I see you want to, but you always stop."

His expression softened. "You said everything hurt your belly. I didn't want to add to that."

"Grayson," I caught his hand and pressed it firmly against the curve, "you can always touch our baby."

His palm warmed my skin through the thin fabric. "It's a boy," he declared suddenly, pressing a kiss to my forehead before dropping to his knees to whisper against my belly. "I can feel it."

I laughed, running fingers through his tousled hair. "As long as there's just one in here." Slipping into comfortable sandals, I called over my shoulder, "Love you! See you tonight!"

"Love you both!" His voice followed me down the hall.

Our new home felt like something out of a fairytale - all vaulted ceilings and sunlight streaming through floor-to-ceiling windows. While I'd loved the energy of the pack house, this private estate finally felt like ours. Grayson had given me carte blanche to renovate, but beyond some aesthetic tweaks, the place was perfect.

The drive to the shop passed in a blur of golden sunlight filtering through the trees. I cranked down the window, letting the crisp autumn air play with my hair. The thought of the bakery's famous cinnamon rolls had my stomach growling in anticipation.

Last time I'd brought back treats just for myself, the entire office had teased me mercilessly. Today, I'd take proper orders before calling in the delivery.

Kris looked up from her workstation as I entered, her newest intern - Ethan or maybe Elijah - hovering nearby with a tray of freshly sterilized tools. The shop hummed with its usual creative energy, the buzz of tattoo machines blending with client laughter.

"Audrey! Just in time," Kris called, waving me over. "We've got a bride coming in for her final consult in twenty. Think you could work your magic on her floral design?"

I grinned, already reaching for my sketchbook. This was exactly the distraction I needed.

###Chapter 0349

"Morning, Evelyn! How's the team today?" I dropped my bag onto the counter with a thud.

"Pretty good, all things considered," Evelyn replied, glancing around. The others nodded in agreement, their expressions relaxed.

"I'm grabbing Starbucks. Anyone want anything?" I pulled out my phone, already scrolling through the app.

"Caramel macchiato for me," Evelyn called out. "Anyone else?"

"No, thanks!"

"I'm good!"

"Just had mine!"

"Got it. One caramel macchiato coming up." I added an iced vanilla latte and a bacon sandwich to my order. "Should be here in twenty." I set my phone aside and turned to my tasks.

I booted up my laptop and started printing labels. Knowing I'd need duplicates, I hit print twice—no point wasting time later. This was the most tedious part of the job, so I wanted it done first.

Just as the printer whirred to a stop, the doorbell chimed. "Delivery for Audrey?"

"That's me!" I took the tray of drinks and my sandwich with a grateful smile.

"Already paid on the app. Enjoy!" The delivery girl waved before heading out.

"Here you go." I placed Evelyn's macchiato carefully on the counter, away from the sterile workspace.

"Thanks!" She blinked at my outfit, then grinned. "That dress is gorgeous."

"It really is. Grayson picked it out—got it in multiple colors too. Anything tight on my stomach bothers me lately, so this is perfect."

"Ugh, same. I can't stand anything that shifts around. I need fitted clothes that stay put." Evelyn absently rubbed her flat stomach, though I noticed a slight bloat. My stomach twisted. If there was more than one in there…

"What's on your agenda today?" Evelyn's question snapped me out of my thoughts.

"Finishing these invitations for you. Oh—crap. I forgot to swing by my office first. I need the Halloween party details. Gotta grab those and finish calling vendors."

"How much is left on the invites?"

"Just assembly and labels. I'll take them to my office to finish. They can go out with our mail. I’ll work from there the rest of the day."

"Need help?" Evelyn looked concerned.

"Nah, I blocked the whole day for this. If I’d remembered my office first, I’d have stayed here, but now I’ll just work there." I sighed. It would’ve been nice to get out, but backtracking for supplies wasn’t worth it.

"Okay. Thanks for handling this." Evelyn smiled.

"Anytime." I grabbed the boxes and headed to my car, loading them into the backseat. Rolling the windows down, I let the crisp morning air in as I drove.

The pack house was eerily quiet when I arrived—except for one person.

"What are you doing?" I froze, startled.

###Chapter 0350

The scent of cigar smoke hit me before I saw him. Xavier stood outside our office door, the glowing tip of his cigar casting an eerie glow in the dim hallway.

"Grayson, Xavier is here," I sent through the mind link, my fingers tightening around the keys as I unlocked the door.

"Seriously? On my way." Grayson's voice was sharp with irritation.

Stepping inside, I dropped my bag onto my desk. Xavier followed, taking a seat without invitation. The acrid smell of smoke clung to him, thick and suffocating.

"No smoking in here," I snapped, watching as he sighed and ground the cigar out against his pant leg. The fabric sizzled faintly, but he didn’t flinch.

"Where’s Grayson?" He leaned back, scanning the room like he expected an ambush.

"On his way. We weren’t sure if you were still alive." My tone was flat, giving nothing away.

Xavier chuckled, the sound rough. "Like a damn cockroach."

"Have you spoken to Vivienne?"

His expression flickered. "Just saw her before coming here. She looks... better." His gaze darted away, uncomfortable.

"She does."

Footsteps pounded down the hall before Grayson appeared, shirtless and glistening with sweat. His jaw was set, eyes burning with barely restrained fury.

"Xavier." His voice was a warning.

"Finally!" Xavier grinned, flashing yellowed teeth. "Just the man I needed."

Grayson didn’t return the smile. "Where the hell have you been? Dropping girls at our doorstep with no explanation—care to enlighten us?"

"I was doing what you asked. Not like I could call every damn minute."

"That was the deal," Grayson snarled, slamming his palms on the desk. The impact rattled the frames on the wall. "You check in, or this arrangement ends."

"I’m checking in now." Xavier crossed his arms. "You want to hear what I found or not?"

Grayson mirrored his stance, muscles coiled. "Start talking."

"Went to an underground fight. Got a girl out, but Raphael spotted me. Crashed the car, sent the girls running, and led his men the other way. Lost them eventually." He shrugged. "Only thing I confirmed? They’re after the title. With Dominic and Damian gone, Raphael wants it."

"So you’re telling me they’re chasing a title that doesn’t exist anymore." Grayson’s voice was dangerously low.

"Which makes Evelyn the Luna and you the Alpha." Xavier smirked. "I may have... suggested you’d be open to a challenge. Easy win for you."

Grayson’s fist slammed down hard enough to crack the wood. "She still holds the Alpha title."

Xavier shifted, uneasy. "Unfortunate. But listen—if you challenge Raphael and Magnus to a fight to the death, we could end this fast."

"You’re out of your damn mind." Grayson’s growl vibrated through the room. "I’m an Alpha. If I slaughtered every weakling who challenged me, I’d be stripped of my rank."

Xavier held up his hands. "Tempers are high. There’s another fight tonight—let me see what else I can dig up. I’m getting those girls out."

We still needed to question them. I watched as Xavier stood, edging toward the door like a cornered animal.

"Anything else you’re not telling me?" Grayson asked, his voice eerily calm.

"Told you everything." Xavier bowed mockingly before bolting out the door.

Grayson locked it behind him, exhaling sharply. "He’s lying."

"Obviously," I muttered, pulling out the stack of invitations from my desk. "Even without knowing the truth, that was painfully clear."

Grayson moved behind me, reading over my shoulder. "Thought you were at the shop today."

###Chapter 0351

"I was supposed to, but I completely forgot to grab the supplies I needed for the Halloween party. So, I figured I'd just finish up here today."

"Perfect timing. We were just wrapping up my tasks. Sebastian should be here in about an hour to question the girls. I was about to head out to get you, but since you're already here..."

"I thought that was scheduled for tomorrow?"

"Apparently, one of them has something urgent to share."

"Well, I suggest you go shower and be back down here before Sebastian arrives," I said without glancing up from my work.

"Can't I question them like this?" Grayson spread his arms wide, still dripping with sweat from his workout.

I finally looked up, meeting his smirk with a deadpan stare. "No."

"Are you getting jealous?" He knelt down, spinning my chair to face him.

"Not at all. Would you prefer if I wore low-cut tops to show off how much my chest has grown?" I shot back.

His eyes darkened. "I'd tie you to the bed."

"Interesting idea." Leaning forward, I traced my fingers down his cheek to his chest, feeling the goosebumps rise beneath my touch. "But you still need to shower." I gave him a quick kiss before turning back to my desk.

"Aren't you going to jump me?" He sounded almost disappointed.

"Nope. We have guests coming, I'm feeling comfortable, and I'd rather save it for later when you're not drenched in sweat. I prefer getting sweaty together."



Grayson moved behind me, his breath hot against my ear. "You're lucky you're pregnant, or I'd bend you over this desk and f*ck you senseless." His voice was rough, sending a shiver down my spine.

A sudden heat flared inside me, but before I could act, he straightened and walked to the door. He threw me a knowing smirk before disappearing, leaving me struggling to calm my racing pulse.

I practically leaped from my chair, hurrying to turn on the fan. The air was a welcome relief against my flushed skin. Returning to my desk, I forced myself to focus on the invitations.

After labeling and stamping them, I set them aside for tomorrow's pickup. Just as I was about to sit down again, a knock sounded at the office door.

For a fleeting second, I hoped it was Grayson—maybe even naked—but instead, Sebastian stood there. "Hey," I greeted, stepping aside to let him in. I barely spared him a glance before returning to my seat.

"How's it going?" he asked awkwardly, lingering near the desk.

"Good. Just finished your invitations." I gestured to the stack.

"Thanks for handling that."

"Happy to help." I pulled out the Halloween decorations, and Sebastian picked up one of the printed photos.

"This is..."

"Too much for you?" I smirked. He was staring at my most grotesque display—a skeleton with pastrami stretched over its bones, forming a macabre charcuterie board.

"No. I just didn't expect this from you."

"What? Why?" I frowned, slightly offended.



"I assumed you were more into cute Halloween themes. Turns out, you're on the dark side."

"I love horror. Maybe I'll go cute next year," I said with a laugh.

Grayson walked in just then, spotting us. "How's it going?" They exchanged a handshake and a quick hug.

"Good. Just admiring her... unique inspiration." Sebastian held up the disturbing skeleton.

"That'll definitely make a statement," Grayson remarked, raising an eyebrow.

"You two have no vision!" I growled, snatching the paper back.

"Giselle is on her way up," Grayson said quickly. Together, they moved to his side of the office.

###Chapter 0352

Sebastian leaned forward, his piercing gaze fixed on Giselle. "What did she want to say?"

Grayson shrugged. "No clue. Just that she insisted on speaking to Audrey directly."

"To me?" I stood, crossing the room to join them. Grayson vacated his chair, gesturing for me to take his place.

"Yeah. Honestly, I think they still see you as their Luna," Grayson mused.

"Or because you're a woman," Sebastian added with a smirk. "You've got that whole 'compassionate leader' reputation."

"Compassionate?" I scoffed, crossing my arms. "Is that code for soft?"

Sebastian grinned. "You gonna prove them wrong?"

"Maybe I will," I shot back, knowing I sounded petty but not caring.

A sharp knock at the door interrupted us. Sebastian opened it, stepping aside as Giselle was escorted in.

"Thank you for agreeing to see me," she murmured. She looked better—clean, fed, though her fingers still picked nervously at her nails.

"Of course," I said gently. "How are you feeling?"

"Better," she admitted, though her gaze remained downcast.

Silence stretched between us.

Finally, I prompted, "What did you want to discuss?"

Giselle swallowed hard. "I-I... I’ll tell you everything I know."

Sebastian and Grayson shifted, positioning themselves behind me to make this feel less like an interrogation.

"What do you think will help us?" I asked.

"I don’t know," she admitted. "But ask me anything. I’ll try to remember. The drugs messed with my head, but I know one thing—Raphael has to die. I’ll do whatever it takes."

"You keep saying Raphael," I noted. "What about Magnus?"

"He’s not innocent, but he never came near me."

"Tell me about your life there," I urged.

She exhaled shakily. "It wasn’t like most packs. From birth to five, we were raised in a strict nursery. No exceptions. Five to fourteen? We worked—cleaning, cooking, whatever they ordered. Once we hit puberty..." Her voice cracked. "The girls were bred. The boys were trained. At eighteen, we were forced to reject our mates."

My stomach twisted. "Did you ever overhear anything while working?"

"A few times." Her fingers stilled. "Raphael was trained to fight, but he wasn’t smart. I heard him brag about a hideout in the woods."

"Where?"

"I don’t know. Just that it was hidden."

"Who was the Gamma?"

"Adrian was Beta."

"Is he still alive?"

"No. He died before I was sold."

I pushed forward. "What was Magnus’s role?"

"Just a warrior. But things might’ve changed after I left."

A new question nagged at me. "Why were you so nervous when Cassandra saw you?"

Giselle flinched. "I didn’t know if she blamed me."

"For what?"

"I killed her mate. That’s why I was sold. Alpha Damian punished me."

My breath caught. "She has a mate here..."

Giselle nodded. "A second-chance mate, then. She might be ashamed to admit it. I would be. Her first mate... wasn’t a good man."

"Who was he?"

"Adrian."

My pulse spiked. "You killed Adrian?"

"Halfway," she admitted bluntly. "Magnus did most of it. I just finished the job."

Sebastian’s voice cut in. "What was Magnus’s motive?"

Giselle met my eyes, her gaze chillingly steady.

"That’s the real question, isn’t it?"

###Chapter 0353

"He always claimed women were beneath him." Giselle's voice trembled. "As cruel as he could be, he never took pleasure in mindless violence. Adrian was... well, Magnus walked in and saw. He had Adrian by the throat. Adrian was about to gut Magnus, so I grabbed a knife from the floor and slit Adrian's neck. Magnus said he'd handle it. The next thing I knew, I was being sold."

"Did Cassandra ever mention any of this to you?" I asked, still processing the revelation.

"No. The first time I saw her was when you were there."

"Have you spoken to her since?" I clarified.

"Oh, no. She only asked if I was okay!" Giselle looked down at her hands. The office fell into heavy silence, the weight of her words settling over us.

"Should we confront Cassandra?" I linked Grayson.

"They're already on their way," Grayson responded instantly.

"Did you ever hear about Raphael wanting to take control?"

"Not specifically. He just wanted power. He probably left the building, hoping they'd all die so he could seize control. He'd always say, 'If I were Alpha...' and throw his weight around."

A sharp knock at the door made Giselle flinch. "It's okay," I reassured her as Grayson opened the door. Nathan and Cassandra stepped inside. I couldn’t miss the anxiety flickering across Cassandra’s face.

"Cassandra, please sit," Grayson said firmly. "Nathan, stay over here."

"What’s going on?" Cassandra’s voice wavered.

"Cassandra, we need to ask you some questions. We're piecing together the truth," I said, keeping my tone steady.

"O-okay?"

"Tell us about your life before you met Nathan," I pressed.

"I-I was a slave. Mostly cooking and cleaning until I was sold to the men Grayson and Sebastian killed."

"Why were you sold?" I pushed further.

"I wasn’t useful anymore, so they discarded me." Cassandra avoided the real issue.

"Was it because your mate died?" I asked bluntly.

Cassandra’s gaze snapped to Giselle, betrayal flashing in her eyes.

"WHAT?" Nathan demanded, trying to step forward, but Grayson and Sebastian blocked him.

"Why does it matter?" Cassandra glared at me, the shy facade crumbling into something fiercer.

"Because omitting the truth is still lying. You know more than you’ve told us." I kept my expression neutral.

"Women were nothing. I was locked in our room until she killed him. Then I was useless, and they sold me. Before, at least I was only abused by one man. Because of her, I was given to more."

Giselle shot up, backing away. "He was torturing me!" Tears welled in her eyes, but her jaw remained set.

"You and everyone else. He was still my mate. At least I learned to endure him. After a while, he wasn’t so bad. He—he was even kind sometimes." Cassandra’s voice cracked with desperation.

I’d heard of Stockholm syndrome, but seeing it firsthand was chilling. Her pleading eyes begged for understanding.

"Who the hell was your mate?" Nathan demanded, fury darkening his expression.

"Adrian," Cassandra admitted.

"Adrian... as in Gamma Adrian from Evelyn’s shop?" Nathan looked at Grayson for confirmation.

"Yes."

Nathan stared at Cassandra as if she’d stabbed him in the back. My chest ached knowing their relationship now hung by a thread. He opened his mouth, then closed it, before storming out. Grayson followed. Sebastian remained by the door. Keeping the link open with Grayson, I continued.

"Did Raphael ever speak to Adrian?"

"Yes. But none of that matters now. Adrian is dead." Cassandra slumped into the chair, burying her face in her hands.

###Chapter 0354

"What were they discussing?"

"I'm not sure. Mostly about some location in the forest where they conducted their activities."

"What kind of activities?" I pressed further.

"I don't know the details. I only overheard them arranging meeting times." Cassandra shrugged.

"Did it ever cross your mind that Raphael might continue his plans even without Adrian?" I asked.

"I didn’t even know what their plans were. For all I knew, they were just deciding which girls to target. Raphael was going to hurt people—with or without Adrian. Whether I knew or didn’t know wouldn’t have changed that."

"Sebastian and Grayson can search for that house. It could save lives. There might be crucial information there!" My frustration grew at her lack of awareness.

"When I met Nathan, I made a vow to leave the past behind. I refused to dwell on what could have been. Nathan gave me a future I could be proud of."

"You're confined to your bedroom until Grayson or I say otherwise. You're also banned from any Beta duties," I stated firmly.

"Seriously?" Cassandra looked stunned.

"Yes, until this situation is resolved and the house is found. You should be more concerned about your relationship with Nathan."

Cassandra stood up, giving me one last glance before storming out.



"I'm sorry. I didn’t mean to cause any trouble," Giselle murmured.

"You didn’t. You just helped uncover the truth. Can you think of anything else that might be useful?" I asked.

"Not right now. I’ll keep thinking." She nervously glanced at the door.

"What’s wrong?" I asked.

"I know she’s in her room, but I’m afraid of what might happen if she sees me in the hallway."

"You can stay with Sebastian’s pack," I said, looking at him. He nodded as she met his gaze. "His mate and mine are twins. I promise you’ll be safe there."

"Can I still volunteer at your school programs?" Giselle asked, her voice laced with worry.

"Of course. There’s a bus that runs from his pack to the school. You can take that." I gave her a reassuring smile, and she nodded in relief.

"If it’s alright, I’ll go pack a bag." Giselle started to stand but hesitated.

"Go ahead. If you remember anything else, you can tell Sebastian or Grayson. Here’s my card—you’re always welcome to call me."

Giselle took the card and bowed slightly. "Thank you." She then hurried past Sebastian, her steps timid.

"Bring Nathan back," I mind-linked Grayson. He didn’t respond, but I knew he’d heard me.

"I think you handled that well," Sebastian remarked after a pause.

Our eyes met. Finding no deceit in his gaze, I let his words sink in. "Good. Thank you," I said just as Grayson pushed Nathan into the room.



"What the hell, man?" Nathan jerked away from Grayson, his anger palpable.

"I’m sorry, Nathan. I wasn’t going to keep this from you. You had a right to know. If Cassandra was going to tell you, she should have done it privately," I explained.

Nathan’s head snapped toward me, his eyes darkening. Grayson moved protectively behind me.

"You think I’d hurt my Luna? A pregnant one at that?" Nathan looked wounded.

"No. But you’re emotional right now, and sometimes our actions aren’t entirely our own," Grayson said, gesturing to a chair.

"What am I supposed to do now?" Nathan ignored Grayson and began pacing.

"I don’t think she meant to hurt you. She was ashamed. She has Stockholm syndrome, Nathan. You’ve shown her what a healthy relationship looks like. She’ll need time and therapy, but I believe she’s coming around… or she will." I kept my voice calm, hoping he’d match my energy.

###Chapter 0355

"You expect me to sleep beside the woman who's been deceiving me for weeks?" Nathan glared at me as if I'd lost my mind.

"Who said anything about sleeping together? Stop being ridiculous, Nathan. We both know you can take a separate room. You need space—or just reject her outright. Believe it or not, your love life isn't the priority here. Cassandra and Giselle mentioned a hidden house in the woods—one Adrian and Raphael frequented. She didn’t know why, but if that intel could’ve saved Evelyn or exposed what’s happening now, she’s accountable."

"This went to hell faster than I expected." Nathan dragged his hands through his hair, pacing like a caged animal.

"Don’t act yet. Pack a bag, stay in another room. Let’s find that house first and see if it even matters. Take a day or two to process this." Grayson’s tone left no room for argument.

"Fine." Nathan dropped his arms, scowling. "But this was a shitty way to drop the truth on me."

"Would you have reacted better if I told you privately? Or would you have stormed off and threatened Cassandra for answers? That would’ve made you the villain here. If she wanted to confess, she would’ve. We had to drag the truth out of her—and you saw how she still lied." Grayson exhaled sharply.

"Going to grab my things." Nathan shoved past us. Sebastian stepped aside, letting him pass. The door slammed shut behind him—hard enough to rattle the frame.

"I confined Cassandra to her room," I told Grayson.



"Good. But I’d prefer you work remotely until this settles. Between Xavier and Cassandra, it’s safer if you’re not here."

"We don’t have guards at my place. How is that safer?"

"She can stay with me," Sebastian offered.

"School starts soon. I’ve got too much to handle—staffing, supplies. I’ll be in and out for the next two weeks."

"Oliver just had a baby…" Grayson pointed out.

"I’ll stay. Nathan will need you to rein him in, and you know the full picture. I’ll guard her until you’re back." Sebastian volunteered like it was nothing.

"You sure?" Grayson raised a brow.

"Yeah. Evelyn might even come along." He shrugged, as if it were casual.

"Great. I get a bodyguard when there’s no actual threat. Wear running shoes."

The corner of Sebastian’s mouth twitched—almost a smile, which was rarer than a blue moon. "Yes, ma’am."

"Good. Settled." Grayson rubbed his temples.

"I’m heading out. Giselle’s coming with me. She doesn’t want to be near Cassandra."

"Can’t blame her." Grayson gave him a nod. "Thanks, man."

"Anytime." Sebastian disappeared down the hall.

"I know this isn’t ideal, but it’ll ease my mind. No one’s more dangerous than someone backed into a corner. Truth is, we don’t know what she’s capable of."

"It’s fine. Won’t stop the projects." I crossed my arms stubbornly.

"Didn’t think it would." Grayson chuckled. "Got a surprise for you."

"Oh?" I perked up.

"Got the call. Vivienne’s house is ready."

###Chapter 0356
Grayson POV

"You look like death warmed over." I studied Nathan's sunken eyes and twitchy fingers. The guy hadn't stopped pacing since dawn.

"Try three nights without sleep," Nathan snapped, rubbing his stubble. Thursday already. Three days of dead ends. We'd grid-searched the territory, turned every stone. My warriors combed through sectors like forensic teams. Still nothing.

Scarlett's Luna ceremony loomed in forty-eight hours. Audrey had transformed into a hurricane of spreadsheets and fabric swatches. Watching her work was... enlightening. Growing up, I'd seen Scarlett's assistants scramble, but never truly noticed the engine behind the scenes. Audrey operated on another level—no complaints, no breaks, just relentless precision. Part of me wanted to chain her to a couch, but the spark in her eyes when discussing centerpieces stopped me. Note to self: talk to Scarlett about reciprocating for Audrey's ceremony.

"Didn't think you could count past twenty-four," I teased. Nathan's glare could've melted steel.

"What do you want from me?" He turned toward the tree line, shoulders rigid.

"The truth. How are you handling this? We both know Cassandra wasn't trying to hurt you." That much was certain. Omissions? Yes. Malicious lies? No.



Nathan kicked a pebble. "I knew she wasn't virgin. Took months for her to stop flinching when I held her hand. We built trust brick by brick—or so I thought." He unearthed a mud-caked remote, tossing it aside. "Turns out the Moon Goddess gave her a landmine. No wonder she panicked at that party when Dominic showed up."

"Have you told her every skeleton in your closet?" I arched a brow.

"That's different!" His fist clenched. "I'd never been mated before her."

"Exactly. She didn't choose this. Dominic would've never let her near us if she'd known anything useful."

"Or he banked on her silence through fear." Nathan's jaw pulsed.

"Enough 'what ifs.' Is she in therapy?" I needed my Beta functional.

"Two sessions already. Two hours each." He scuffed leaves with his boot.

"ALPHA!" A warrior's shout sliced through the trees.

We sprinted toward the commotion. The patrol stood frozen before Rosewood Manor—a listing Victorian corpse. Peeling paint, boarded windows, the whole structure leaning like a drunkard.



"Hold position. That deathtrap could collapse any second." Nathan and I approached cautiously.

Vines strangled the yard's debris: a splintered chair here, rusted bed frame there. The basement window's broken glass teeth grinned up at us—too narrow even for Audrey's petite frame. Every artifact wore a thick coat of neglect.

###Chapter 0357

The rusty hinges screamed as Nathan cautiously pushed open the back door. "Holy hell!" He leaped backward as a raccoon darted between his legs, vanishing into the underbrush.

"Someone's skittish today." I bit my lip to suppress a laugh, though my grin was unmistakable.

"Shut it." Nathan grumbled, stepping inside.

We found ourselves in a cramped alcove off the kitchen. Chains dangled from the ceiling, just high enough that even my six-foot frame required tiptoeing to reach them. Dust coated every surface, but the disturbed footprints on the floor told a different story—someone had been here recently.

Nathan veered left into what might have once been a living room. No TV, just a soot-stained fireplace flanked by two couches draped in dingy white sheets. Brown smears—blood, most likely—spattered the fabric.

"Look." I pointed at the footprints. They led deeper into the house, splitting at a junction: left into another room, or straight toward a spiral staircase. "I'll take upstairs. You check down here."

Nathan nodded and moved on while I ascended. Each step groaned ominously, as if the wood might collapse beneath me. When I finally reached the top, I exhaled sharply, unaware I'd been holding my breath.

The landing was claustrophobic, barely big enough to turn around. A dead plant wilted in a cracked pot beside a grimy window overlooking the front yard. My warriors patrolled below, vigilant but uneasy.

Pushing open the lone door, I stepped into what had clearly been repurposed from a bedroom into an office. A desk—more like a repurposed dining table—dominated the center. Papers littered its surface and the floor around it. A red-shaded lamp cast eerie shadows in the corner.

Against the far wall, a couch sat uncovered, strewn with women's clothing and a single discarded shoe. Ignoring that, I rifled through the desk. Beneath the chaos, my fingers closed around a small black box—a key-copying device.

Blueprints lay beneath it. One depicted the building where Scarlett had been held—now rubble, thanks to Sebastian and me. Useless now, but frustrating. If we'd had this sooner...

Another blueprint detailed our pack territories, complete with tunnel routes and construction timelines. Too little, too late. Still, Scarlett might spot something I'd missed. She always did.

As I gathered the documents, something glinted from the floor—a charcoal sketch propped against the wall. The paper was aged, brittle, but the subject seized my breath.

A wolf.

Not identical to the one in my office, but close enough. My pulse spiked as I lifted it, my gaze dropping to the corner.

There, in elegant cursive: Adalynn.

My mother's signature.

###Chapter 0358

"Nathan, you need to see this!" Grayson's voice echoed up the creaky staircase, urgency lacing every syllable.

"On my way." Clutching the photograph tighter, I cast one final glance around the abandoned bedroom before descending. The floorboards groaned beneath my boots like tortured spirits.

The main floor was eerily vacant. "Place has been stripped clean," Nathan remarked, kicking an empty cigarette pack. "But someone's been here recently. Fresh butts, clean clothes folded on that chair. Bloodstains without dust covering them."

"What's so important then?" I eyed the crumpled fast-food wrappers. Surely he didn't summon me for trash.

"This." He rounded the corner where a yawning black maw gaped in the floorboards. Another damn basement. My horror movie-addicted brain conjured images of skeletal fingers reaching between the slats to snag my ankles.

Nathan descended without hesitation. "Light switch is down here. But stand here—" He positioned me on the third step. "—for full effect. Ready?"

"Thrilled," I deadpanned.

The fluorescents buzzed to life. My lungs seized. Three recessed cells lined the far wall, each containing nothing but a stained mattress and chains bolted to concrete. Gleaming dog collars dangled from the ends like perverted ornaments. The adjacent wall displayed a macabre pharmacy—needles, charred spoons, tourniquets.



"This was their showroom," Nathan spat. "Ask Giselle, but those barred windows are the only exits besides these stairs." He yanked away a moldy tarp, revealing a cage large enough for twenty. Steel benches lined the perimeter. Directly center, a rusted showerhead aimed downward like a accusing finger.

Water suddenly erupted from it. Nathan twisted the hidden valve shut. "They'd corral the girls here. Hose them down like cattle. Then parade them in those viewing cubbies." His knuckles whitened around the pipe. "Either sampling the merchandise or judging by appearance."

"My thoughts exactly." I watched water droplets snake between our boots.

"Upstairs office has a couch. Testing grounds." Nathan's jaw worked. "Bet if we dig up the yard, we'll find their rejects."

The operation was too elaborate for pack territory. "Why not use their compound?"

"Adrian and Lorenzo might've been running this side hustle," I mused.

"Or we're missing the bigger picture." Nathan's gaze swept the concrete walls.

"God help me, we might need Scarlett's twisted genius." The last person I wanted involved, but if there were hidden clues...

"Find any cameras?" Nathan's question hung in the damp air like the scent of old fear.

###Chapter 0359

"No. I didn't." The words tasted foreign on my tongue, but my instincts screamed this wasn't right. My fingers flew across my phone screen, dialing Sebastian's number before I could second-guess myself.

"What?" Sebastian's gruff voice answered instantly.

"We've located the property, but I need Scarlett to examine it."

The line went eerily quiet before muffled voices argued in the background. "Hello?" Scarlett's bored drawl finally came through.

"Hey, sis. Found the place but something's off. Need your expert eyes."

"I'm in pajamas eating cookie dough ice cream." She sounded thoroughly unamused.

"Please?"

"Hmm..."

"Fine, what's your price?" Having a twin sister was exhausting on good days.

"Your famous lasagna. The one with three cheeses."

"You're pushing your luck."

"Bye then." She called my bluff effortlessly.

"Fine! Just get your ass here." I ended the call and sent my location before shoving the phone in my pocket.

"I assume she's coming." Nathan didn't even glance my way.

"With bells on."

"Alpha! Over here!" A warrior's shout came from the tree line.

Three men stood clustered around something on the ground. As I approached, a man's face stared blankly up from the dirt.

"Wasn't buried deep. I literally tripped over his face," the warrior admitted.

"Uncover him." The corpse looked relatively fresh - maybe five days dead. But as they dug, my stomach turned. Crudely carved across his bare chest read "Alpha Grayson of Nightshade." The letters were so crooked I had to tilt my head to decipher them. Maggots already feasted on his abdomen.

"Take him to our morgue. Full autopsy." My command sent warriors scrambling to extract the decaying body.

"Where the hell are you?" Scarlett's shriek carried across the property.

"Over here!" I jogged to intercept them before they saw the corpse. Rounding the corner, I found all three unexpected guests.

"Didn't realize this was a family outing." I kissed Audrey's cheek as she reached up.

"You asked me to watch Audrey, and I wasn't sending Evelyn out here alone. So..." Sebastian shrugged, gesturing to the ATV parked nearby.

"You dragged me here. What do you want?" Scarlett examined her nails like this was the most tedious errand imaginable.

"What's inside that house... it's inhuman. Prepare yourself." I pulled Audrey close as I locked eyes with Evelyn. "This might be disturbing."

"Your men are carrying a dead body..." Evelyn peeked around me. "Yeah, I figured this wouldn't be a tea party." She rolled her eyes and marched toward the house.

"You can wait here if you need to." I muttered to Sebastian. He snorted and followed her.

I watched them circle the property before disappearing inside. My jaw clenched seeing how carelessly my warriors handled the corpse - though I'd never specifically ordered discretion.

"You okay?" Audrey's small hand squeezed mine. Her wide, worried eyes made my chest ache.

"Yeah. That house is... it's a nightmare made real." I pulled her tighter against me. She buried her face in my chest, arms wrapping around my waist.

"Then why send Evelyn in there?"

"She sees what others can't. I need to be certain about this place. She might spot something I missed."

The distant creak of the front door announced their return. Evelyn's face had lost all color, her usual sarcasm replaced by something far more unsettling. Whatever she'd seen in that house had shaken her to the core.

"Tell me," I demanded, bracing for the worst.

Her lips parted, but no words came. For the first time in our lives, my unflappable sister looked truly speechless.

###Chapter 0360

"I knew that. What I meant was, why send her in there to witness what might be a torture chamber for women? Would you ever ask me to go inside?"

"Absolutely not. You're never setting foot in that place." The double standard was glaring, but I couldn't help it. My sister wasn't the same as my mate.

To my relief, Audrey didn’t press further. Instead, we watched Evelyn move from window to window, her silhouette flickering behind the grimy glass. Then she vanished—undoubtedly descending into the basement. Did I like sending her in there? Not one bit. But too much was at stake.

My phone buzzed in my pocket. I answered without checking the caller ID. "Alpha Grayson."

"That title still sounds strange coming from you." My spine stiffened instantly, and I stepped away from Audrey.

"Stay with Nathan. I need to take this," I murmured before walking off.

Evelyn's POV

Grayson hadn’t lied. This place was a waking nightmare for any woman.

The kitchen nook greeted me with rusted chains bolted to the walls. The drywall bore deep gouges—evidence of desperate struggles.

My mind snapped into investigator mode, shutting down all emotion. It was like flipping a switch. Sebastian hated when I did this—it severed our emotional link, leaving him blind to my feelings.

And yet, as I moved through the house, he shadowed me closely, his gaze flickering between the surroundings and me.

Thankfully, he lingered in doorways, giving me space to analyze. The fact that Grayson had asked me to do this spoke volumes.

The footprints told a story—two distinct sizes, two different men. At first glance, this seemed like a hideout, a place to stash and dispose of victims. But I was wrong.

The basement changed everything.

Three rooms, strategically positioned for observation. The mattresses sagged with eerie indentations.

"What are you doing?" Sebastian grabbed my arm as I stepped into one of the rooms.

"Stand there." I pointed to a spot beneath the stairs. Carefully, I lowered myself onto the mattress, positioning my body where the deepest impression was. The angle suggested someone had sat upright, leaning against the wall—not lying down.

"Come. Sit here." I gestured to another sunken spot.

Sebastian adjusted several times before settling in. "Like this?"

"With you in that position, it's almost like..." My voice trailed off as I scanned the room. Drug paraphernalia littered the floor—enough to distract from the real horror.

"Like what?"

"They spent time like this. Perfect for injecting someone." I extended my arm, and Sebastian mimed sliding a needle into my vein. "And it allows for an audience."

"Training people?" he asked.

"Or teaching them how to handle the women they trafficked." I shook my head, uncertain, but I'd seen enough. "Help me up."

He pulled me to my feet, and we crossed to the other side of the basement. A sheet had been yanked back, revealing a holding cell. The floor was still damp—Grayson must’ve found the drainage switch.

"What’s your theory?" Sebastian asked.

###Chapter 0361

"I'm not entirely sure." We began ascending the stairs. When we reached the front door, I paused in front of it. "From this angle, everything looks pristine. A fresh bouquet in the vase over there. A framed painting on the wall here. Almost... inviting. The path to the staircase is unobstructed, everything still well-maintained. Fully furnished rooms. Less dust in those areas, as if someone had been actively cleaning them."

Sebastian followed closely behind me. "Then you reach the grand staircase. Beneath the layer of dust, the wood is polished, preserved. The carpet on the steps is intact—no tears, no wear. At the landing, another vase of flowers. Again, welcoming. This place was designed to make a woman feel at ease."

"I can see that," Sebastian agreed.

"Then you enter this office." I gestured toward the couch. "Judging by the restraints on the legs, this is where they first took them. See how they bolted it to the floor? So it wouldn’t shift. It’s like they brought them up here for some kind of... interview. Maybe even offered them tea or water laced with something."

"Then dragged them to the basement."

"Exactly. This was more of a side operation than anything. Raphael might have lost a lot of clients when Adrian died. Taking Audrey could’ve been his way of flipping them off—a big 'I don’t need Adrian to do this' statement. Maybe he wants to sell her to jumpstart his business again. Those clients probably lost all faith in him after everything collapsed."

"That’s an interesting theory." Sebastian nodded, but his gaze drifted upward, toward the ceiling.

"What are you looking at?" I asked.

"There was a window at the very top of the house. Circular, with a stained-glass floral design. It’s not in this room."

"You think there’s an attic?" I started scanning the space. "Most houses like this have a pull-down ladder hidden in a closet." I moved to the nearest door and yanked it open. On my second try, I found it—a small, unassuming hatch, typical for a house of this era. But above it, a rectangular cutout marred the ceiling.

"Find it?" Sebastian stepped up behind me.

"I did." I shifted aside as he reached for the thin cord dangling from the hatch. A sharp tug sent a cascade of dust—and who knew what else—raining down onto his head, followed by the creaking descent of a rickety ladder. "That’s a tight squeeze."

"I won’t fit." Sebastian tested the first step, only for it to snap under his weight.

"Then lift me up," I said.

"Absolutely not." He shot me a look like I’d lost my mind.

"What? We need to check up there."

"You could fall straight through the floor!" He pointed at the broken step.

"Good thing you’re excellent at catching me." I patted his arm and maneuvered around him before he could argue further. He exhaled sharply but relented, hands settling firmly on my hips to steady me as I climbed.

Each step groaned ominously beneath me. My emotions were still locked down, but I’d bet Sebastian was sweating bullets by now. Finally, I reached the top.

"You got a flashlight?" I called down. "On your phone?"

"Yeah." He fished his phone from his pocket and activated the light.

At first glance, it was a standard attic—loose insulation strewn across the floor, stacks of cardboard boxes. No glowing eyes stared back at me, which was a relief. The last thing I wanted was a face-to-face with a bat.

"I’m going in," I announced.

"Do you have to?" Sebastian groaned, but his protest fell on deaf ears. He knew I wasn’t backing down.

"Yes."

###Chapter 0362

The moment my feet touched the creaky wooden floorboards, a thick, oppressive atmosphere settled around me. Swinging the flashlight beam across the room only intensified the unease coiling in my gut. Exposed wires snaked along the walls like veins, and the markings on the ceiling—crude, almost ritualistic—looked more like dark incantations than innocent children's doodles.

A cluster of large boxes huddled in the corner, their flaps loosely folded, untouched by tape. Spiders had claimed them as their domain. I wasn’t terrified of them, but I’d rather not have an eight-legged surprise crawling up my arm.

"SH*T!" I yelped as a particularly monstrous one scuttled out from beneath a box, darting under another before I could blink.

"Everything okay?" Sebastian's voice echoed up from below.

"Yeah, just a spider the size of a damn tarantula," I called back, shaking off the shiver down my spine. I turned my attention to the first box, flipping it open to find it crammed with stacks of yellowed paperwork. Not exactly thrilling, but maybe something useful was buried in there.

Too eager to stay in this creepy attic any longer, I shoved the box toward the opening. Balancing my phone upside down to keep the flashlight aimed, I used my foot to slide it across the dusty floor.

"What are you doing?" Sebastian demanded.

"You ready to catch?" I called, nudging the box closer to the edge.

"Catch wh—" His protest was cut off by the loud thud of the box hitting the ground, followed by the flutter of papers scattering everywhere. "GODDAMN IT, EVELYN!"

"Oops?" I couldn’t help the laugh that escaped me.

"Yeah, real funny," he grumbled.

The next box held a collection of antique toys and tiny, delicate baby clothes. Maybe not valuable, but definitely intriguing. There could be names, dates—anything to tell us more about the people who once lived here.

"Next box coming down. It’s light but fragile," I warned.

"Sure it is," Sebastian muttered, though I heard him shifting below, preparing.

I didn’t bother inspecting the rest, just slid them one by one to the opening and let them drop. Miraculously, he caught them all. After snapping a few photos of the eerie wall markings, I peered down at him. Arms crossed, irritation written all over his face.

"Done," I announced.

"Thank god," he huffed, holding up his hands. Carefully, I descended the ladder, letting him steady me as I stepped onto solid ground.

"Were you worried about me?" I teased, dusting off my jeans.

"Nah. Just mentally drafting the speech I’d give Grayson when his sister plummeted through the floorboards." His smirk made me gasp in mock outrage.

"Rude."

"Come on, let’s get these to the office so you can tell Grayson all about your treasures," he said, already hauling the boxes toward the stairs.

"Need help?" I jogged after him.

"Too heavy for you right now," he said without looking back. "I’ll get a warrior to handle it."

The reminder of my pregnancy stung, even if he didn’t mean it to. "Fine."

Then he spun so fast I nearly collided with him. "And Evelyn?" His voice dropped, rough and commanding.

"What?"

"Turn your damn emotions back on." The growl in his voice sent a bolt of heat straight through me, my thighs pressing together instinctively. I flicked the mental switch, letting the bond flood back in.

"Good girl," he murmured, then turned and strode out the front door, leaving me flushed and breathless.

Grayson was waiting outside, eyeing the boxes as Sebastian loaded them into the gator. "Find anything useful?"

"Let’s get these to your office and I’ll go through them properly," I said, suddenly exhausted.

"You okay?" Grayson frowned.

"Just tired."

"Alright. You and Audrey go sit down. We’ll head out once these are loaded." He pressed a kiss to Audrey’s forehead before following Sebastian.

Victoria’s POV

What fresh hell had I stumbled into?

This wasn’t what I’d imagined—not even close. Stressed didn’t begin to cover it. Weeks without proper food had whittled me down three dress sizes. My hair hung in limp strands, my cheeks hollow, eyes shadowed.

Sitting on the edge of the bed, I was too drained for tears. All I’d ever wanted was to be loved. Was that too much to ask?

Growing up, I’d dreamed of a fairytale—a mate who’d cherish me, a pack that felt like home. Instead, I got him. And my world had shattered.

My mind flashed back to that morning. Every nerve had been alight, my heart racing with excitement. I’d thought I was finally meeting my destiny. I’d curled my hair, slipped into a sundress, painted my face like the perfect Luna-to-be.

What a joke.

###Chapter 0363

The moment our eyes met, I waited for that electric connection to spark between us. But there was nothing. Just emptiness. The world around me seemed to crumble, leaving only Grayson and me standing there—except instead of joy, my heart shattered into a million pieces.

The man I had loved with every fiber of my being was looking at me with pity. Not heartbreak, not regret—just pity. And all he could say was, "I'm sorry." No embrace, no comforting touch. Just those two hollow words.

I couldn’t take it. I turned and fled to my room, my vision blurred with tears. In my frantic search for tissues, I didn’t see the curling iron I’d left on the counter. Though I’d turned it off, the metal was still searing hot. The burn on my palm was just the beginning of my disastrous night.

After the birthday celebration, some friends dragged me to a bar—not Grayson’s, but another one in town. They promised it would be fun, a distraction. And God, did I need one. Every glance at Grayson and Audrey felt like a knife twisting in my chest.

I forced a smile, pretending I was fine, until I stumbled into a stranger on the dance floor. Whatever the girls had slipped into my drink was kicking in hard. The second our eyes locked, the bond snapped into place. He didn’t hesitate—his hands gripped my waist, yanking me against him before his lips crashed onto mine.

This was how I’d imagined it with Grayson.

In my hazy, intoxicated mind, he was Grayson.

Every touch sent waves of pleasure through me, so intense I could barely breathe. The next thing I knew, we were in a dimly lit back room, my clothes discarded, my teeth buried in his neck before he marked me in return. Then—blackness.

When I woke the next morning, reality hit me like a truck. Part of me was terrified. The other part? Strangely at peace. He had been gentle, never pushing me beyond what I allowed. Even now, as he kissed my forehead and dropped me off a mile from my pack, his touch was tender.

We couldn’t be seen together. His pack loyalty kept him from bringing me into his world, and he couldn’t abandon them for me. Magnus—that was his name—promised he’d figure things out. Until then, we had a secluded cabin in the woods where we met in secret.

Every time I was with him, he was perfect. Sweet kisses, whispered promises, raw passion. He confessed how badly he wanted to leave his pack, to build a life with me. But then he’d tell me about the horrors he’d committed the day before.

And now he wanted me to break into Grayson’s office?

To make matters worse, Audrey’s father was blackmailing me. He claimed he wanted to help, but I didn’t trust him. Still, if there was even a sliver of a chance to protect Magnus, I’d take it.

I wiped my tears, then grabbed a short pink bob wig and dramatic makeup—enough to disguise me completely. Most of the warriors were gone, and I watched as Alpha Sebastian left with Audrey and Luna Evelyn.

This was my chance.

I had a letter in my pocket, one I’d debated giving them for days. Part of me wanted Grayson to fix everything, but I knew that wouldn’t happen. Still, I couldn’t let my pack suffer—not when I knew danger was coming.

I just didn’t know who the threat was—Audrey? The entire pack?

Creeping out of my room, I made my way toward Grayson’s office—his office, not ours. My brain had finally accepted that Audrey hadn’t stolen him from me. It wasn’t her fault.

But I still hated her.

The hallway was empty as I knelt before the door, fumbling with the lock. My hands shook so badly I thought I might pass out—or worse.

Then a voice cut through the silence.

"What are you doing?"

My blood turned to ice.

###Chapter 0364

My heart leaped into my throat as I jumped, my hand slamming against the door handle. The tools in my grip clattered to the ground, along with the letter—thankfully landing face-up.

"Goodness, did I scare you?"

I whirled around, pressing my palm over the letter. Vivienne stood behind me, her expression laced with concern. "A little," I admitted, exhaling sharply. I had been checking if Alpha Grayson was inside, but clearly, he wasn’t.

Seizing the opportunity, I scooped up the tools and the letter, shoving them into my pocket as Vivienne settled onto the floor with a sigh.

"They're out right now," she said, smoothing her skirt before smiling at me. "I don’t recall seeing you around before."

"Oh, I—uh—just changed my hair color." I fumbled for an excuse.

Vivienne’s gaze softened. "I’m a bit melancholy today. This packhouse has been lovely, but I’m moving into my own home, and Audrey isn’t here to help." Her eyes glazed over, lost in memory. "When I was your age, I was so full of dreams. My father, Alpha Nathaniel, spoiled me rotten."

She caught sight of my mark, and her lips curved wistfully. "I remember hoping my mate would mark me one day."

Damn.

Adjusting my shirt, I shifted to sit more comfortably. Vivienne didn’t seem in a hurry to leave, so as she rambled on, I discreetly slid the note under the door. No way was I getting into that office now—I’d have to try again later.

"Study hard, sweet girl," Vivienne said with a chuckle. "Smart Lunas get the best mates. That’s what my father always told me." She sighed. "Clearly, I didn’t study hard enough."

Her expression darkened. "Those years in that dungeon… I’m not proud of what I did, but it was my revenge. Back then, I was stunning. The more I flirted, the more they couldn’t resist me."

Her lips twisted into a smirk. "Of course, it only went so far because Damian would sense the betrayal and come running to kill whoever dared touch me. But I didn’t care. They all deserved to die."

"That must have taken so much strength," I murmured.

"Not really." She shrugged. "When your world is nothing but dirt, you find ways to entertain yourself. It made me feel human again—not just some plaything." Her smirk widened. "Sure, I got punished, but knowing I pissed him off? Worth it."

There wasn’t an ounce of regret in her voice.

"Can’t say I blame you," I said with a quiet laugh. "But what did the guards say? If you sweet-talked them, how did they even respond?"

Vivienne tilted her head. "What do you mean?"

"Well, if Damian commanded them not to speak to you, how did you get them to break the order?"

"Oh, he did command them," she said, eyes gleaming. "But they were men. Men who thought women were beneath them." She leaned in conspiratorially. "If words didn’t work, I put on a show. I wasn’t allowed clothes, and after a while… you stop caring."

A wicked grin spread across her face. "They couldn’t resist. And that drove Damian insane. He’d come storming back, screaming about having to fly or drive all the way from the woods."

"Where did he even go?" I asked.

"My father had a vacation home a state over. No idea what’s become of it now, but Damian always claimed he had 'business' there."

I hesitated before asking the question burning in my mind. "Why didn’t Xavier ever get you out?"

Her smile faltered.

"Why didn’t anyone give you a better life?"

###Chapter 0365

"One warrior against an entire battalion? I highly doubt he would've survived long. Not to mention, he had to protect our precious Audrey. Damian never stopped searching for her. Even with Dominic stabbing him in the back at every opportunity. That man should've focused on raising his own son instead of obsessing over my daughter." Vivienne's voice dripped with lingering bitterness.

"How exactly did Dominic betray him?"

"Dominic manipulated his so-called friends into doing his dirty work. Repeatedly. I overheard their heated arguments in the cells. They thought no one was listening - or at least no one who'd live to tell about it. That boy's head was stuffed with nothing but sawdust."

"What kind of things did he make them do?"

"The details escape me. Something about an underground operation, but I never caught the full story. Damian would storm in, fuming about having to clean up after his son's messes, while I just prayed Dominic would behave for once to spare his father the grief."

"You seem to genuinely care for Xavier, though," I observed simply.

"With all my heart. I'd move mountains for that man. He protected our daughter all these years at tremendous personal cost. I believe he sacrificed most of his humanity in the process. The Xavier you see today bears little resemblance to the man he was two decades ago."

"I can only imagine."

"And now she's Alpha, carrying my grandchild. Yet I'd still lay down my life for Xavier without hesitation. If I had to storm the most impenetrable fortress to save him, I'd do it in a heartbeat." Vivienne's vow carried the weight of absolute conviction.

"Even if it meant certain death?"

"Precisely. True love means being willing to die for that person. The mating bond connects bodies, but your mind remains painfully aware of the darkness people can harbor. Eventually, you face a choice - either embrace blind devotion, adopt their twisted worldview while numbing your emotions, or resist the bond's pull. No love comes easy, but knowing someone would sacrifice everything for you? That's worth holding onto."

Her words struck a chord deep within me. Did I truly believe Magnus was redeemable? Was he worth saving? Recalling our shared moments, he'd always treated me with basic decency. Rough around the edges, certainly, but given his upbringing, that was hardly surprising. He claimed to want out, and so far, his actions hadn't contradicted that.

"What's troubling you, dear?" Vivienne's perceptive gaze met mine as I looked up.

"Just... trying to navigate my path in this world. Searching for my own happy ending," I deflected carefully. The last thing I needed was to reveal too much.

"Trust your instincts, child." Vivienne offered a warm smile as she began rising from her seat.

"Let me help you." I sprang up immediately, offering my hand to steady her.

"Thank you. The wounds have healed, but the pain lingers occasionally."

"Of course. I should be going now, but thank you for the conversation." An inexplicable urgency to leave suddenly gripped me.

"Visit anytime. I've enjoyed our chat!" Vivienne waved as she turned away. Without hesitation, I hurried off in the opposite direction.

Audrey's POV

Never had I been so relieved to return to the packhouse. That ominous Rosewood Manor gave me chills. Even without entering, the place radiated malevolence - a suffocating presence that made breathing difficult.

"Oh, Audrey!" Vivienne's cheerful greeting snapped me from my thoughts. We crossed paths at the packhouse entrance as she was leaving.

"Hello! How's your day been?" I forced polite conversation.

"Quite wonderful, actually. Are you free later? Perhaps for a late lunch?" Hope sparkled in Vivienne's eyes.

"Certainly. I've got a meeting now, but shall we say the gardens afterward?" I suggested.

###Chapter 0366

"That sounds wonderful. I'll take care of all the arrangements." Vivienne's radiant smile sent an unexpected warmth through me. As she hurried back inside, Grayson's hand settled on the small of my back.

"You were kind to agree to meet with her." We continued walking toward the office.

"Honestly, I haven't made any effort to get to know her yet."

"Why not?" Evelyn asked as we reached our office.

"I could blame it on being busy, but the truth is, I've been avoiding her. Avoiding the entire situation." Grayson held the door open for us, closing it behind us as we entered. I sank onto the couch while Evelyn settled beside me, and Grayson took his seat behind the desk.

"Why avoid her? Haven't you always wondered about your parents?" Evelyn pressed.

"I have, but I assumed they were dead. My mother lived in a cell, and my father roamed the streets—doing things I probably don’t want to know about. What would we even talk about?"

"Tell her about your project and why it matters to you. Talk about our mother, how you live in her house now, or the drawings you’ve hung up."

"I don’t know… Maybe that’s a good idea."

"Listen, I never had a mother. Ours died, and I’d give anything to have her back. You have a chance to know yours. She might not be what you imagined, but I think you’d be surprised by how much you have in common." Evelyn rested her hand on my knee.

"I’ll try," I said after a pause.

"Sebastian is going to document everything before burning that house down. We can start without him," Grayson interjected, cutting Evelyn off. I wasn’t sure if he did it on purpose, but I was grateful either way.

"Alright. So, overall, I got the sense they lured girls in through the front door and up to the office. I’d bet they drugged them—either attacked them there or moved them to the basement. As for the basement, I think they kept the girls in that holding cell before transferring them to the rooms. Now, those indentations on the mattress—I sat on one, and Sebastian helped me. Based on their position, the girl would’ve been sitting upright, leaning against the wall. It felt more like someone was being taught how to inject drugs. Like he was training people to control the women." Evelyn looked at Grayson.

"Really?" Grayson leaned back, studying Evelyn. Suddenly, I felt more like an observer than a participant in this conversation.

"Those dips in the mattress only form from prolonged pressure. Someone had to sit there for hours, maybe days. The girls were sitting up. Sure, they could’ve been assaulted, but it felt more like someone learning to administer injections."

"Interesting." Grayson steepled his fingers as he regarded his twin.

"I think they ran a business—capturing girls, then selling them to traffickers who’d resell them. They handled the risky part: finding and trapping the girls. Then they’d let others sell them for a cut, teaching them how to manage their 'inventory.' They must have a partner out there who finds buyers, selecting girls based on looks or availability. Maybe both. That’s my theory."

"What about how this might affect Audrey?" Grayson asked.

"Well, that’s where things get tricky. I’m just throwing out an idea here…"

###Chapter 0367

"What if..." Evelyn gave Grayson a long look before turning to me. "This is just speculation." She said carefully before facing Grayson again. "What if Lorenzo is trying to take Adrian's place and continue the business? Now that he's lost his credibility, his buyers might be hesitant. He needs to prove he can handle this. What better way than capturing and selling the pack's Alpha? The daughter who inherited everything. The girl who took it all from Dominic."

My lips parted, and I shut my eyes as she spoke. It was too much. My fingers instinctively curled over my stomach as Evelyn fell silent. When I opened my eyes again, Grayson was staring at his sister—an unspoken exchange between them that had never unsettled me until now.

Knock! Knock! The office door rattled, but Grayson had locked it. He stood and opened it for Nathan. "Sorry, I'm running late. Sebastian needed help with the boxes. They're outside if you want them brought in?"

"Yes, please." Evelyn answered before either of us could.

"Got it." Nathan stepped out, and Grayson followed.

"Are you okay? It's just a theory," Evelyn said softly, resting her hand on my knee.

"When have your theories ever been wrong?" I gave her a weak smile, fighting back the tears threatening to spill.

"There's a first time for everything." She tried to pull me into a hug, but I leaned away gently.

"Thank you, but I don’t want to be touched right now."

"I get that. More than you know." Evelyn whispered as the men returned with the boxes.

I watched as the three of them knelt on the floor, sifting through the contents. I asked for this, didn’t I? I wanted to be part of the discussions involving me. Evelyn had been the target from the beginning—kidnapped twice, yet she never broke. I wanted to be like her, but... this was too much. If she was right—and she rarely wasn’t—I was their target because they wanted to make an example of me. Finding that house might have been a lead, but if Cassandra had been honest from the start, we could’ve known sooner.

"Love, are you okay?" Grayson's voice echoed in the mind-link.

I startled. I hadn’t realized I’d zoned out. When I glanced over, Grayson was still flipping through papers, pretending not to watch me—giving me space to collect myself.

"No... yes... I don’t know."

"We don’t have proof that Scarlett’s theory is even true."

"When is she ever wrong?" I countered.

"I’ll keep you safe." He promised.

"Like Sebastian kept Evelyn safe?" The moment the words left me, I knew I’d crossed a line. Grayson shot to his feet, his dark eyes burning with fury.

"Whoa, what’s going on?" Evelyn jumped between us. Nathan grabbed Grayson’s arms, yanking him back.

"That’s your mate, man."

"What did you just say?" Grayson growled at me.

"I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said it." My voice cracked as tears spilled over.

"What did she say?" Evelyn turned to me sharply.

"Grayson said he’d keep me safe, and..."

"And what?" Evelyn pressed.

"I said he’d keep me safe like Sebastian kept you safe."

Evelyn froze for a heartbeat. She didn’t yell. Didn’t even look angry. "Grayson, let’s take a walk." She grabbed his arm and pulled him out, shutting the door behind them.

###Chapter 0368

"That was uncalled for, Evelyn." Nathan's gaze bore into me.

"I know." My voice cracked. "The words left my mouth before I could stop them. But tell me I'm wrong, Nathan. Tell me Sebastian didn't do everything possible, and she still got taken? With all the security, all the precautions—how did it still happen?" My hands trembled. "I'm not Scarlett, Nathan. I don't fight. I don't throw punches. I organize charity galas and build learning centers for children. Scarlett could defend herself. What can I do? I'm pregnant. I can't fight. I wouldn't stand a chance."

"Hey." Nathan stepped forward, arms open.

I hadn't realized I was crying until his warmth enveloped me. The dam broke, all my fears spilling out. "I'm sorry."

"Evelyn, no one expects you to know this world. That's why we keep it hidden. We grew up in danger. You didn’t. There’s no shame in not wanting this life."

"But I have to know. Our children will need to be trained. And if something happens to Grayson..." My throat tightened. "I’ll have to lead until they’re ready. That means understanding everything."

Nathan pulled back, hands firm on my shoulders. "You’ve only been Luna for a short time." His voice softened. "No one is immune to fear. Look at me and Cassandra. You saw me lose my mind over her. You saw the bruises Grayson and Sebastian carried for weeks. Scarlett? She’s ice on the outside, but inside? She shattered. She cries when she thinks no one can hear. I’ve sat outside her door more times than I can count, just to make sure she didn’t do something reckless." He squeezed my arms. "Some handle it better, but no one escapes the fear. I promise you, Scarlett was terrified the entire time she was taken."

"Grayson acts like it’s nothing," I whispered, the confession a relief.

Nathan smirked. "You don’t see him at training. He’s pushing the warriors harder than ever. Security’s tighter, protocols stricter. He’s trying to keep you calm, Evelyn."

"What?"

"You’re pregnant. Stress isn’t good for you or the babies. Plus, this world is new to you. It’s scarier when you’re not raised in it." He sighed. "And let’s be real—there’s been no direct threat. Just Xavier sending girls and Seraphina running her mouth. We don’t know anything. This is all speculation. Why panic over a threat that might not exist?"

"I’m trying to be strong."

"And you are." His voice gentled. "Break down if you need to. Process it. But find a way to stand tall—for your babies, for Grayson’s sanity. Your legacy doesn’t have to be war. It can be education, kindness. The Luna who heals. But you must stay strong for those who need you. Level-headed. Unshaken." He tapped my temple. "Feel what you need to feel, but don’t lose yourself in it."

###Chapter 0369

"I understand you're right, but I'm struggling with how to proceed."

"That's not something I can answer for you. The solution lies within yourself." Nathan released me and took a measured step back.

After a thoughtful pause, I glanced at my watch. "I should meet Vivienne for brunch now."

"Excellent idea. Enjoy your meal and try to relax. The weather's perfect today." Nathan escorted me to the door, swinging it open. Grayson and Sebastian were conspicuously absent.

"Thank you, Nathan." My voice carried genuine gratitude before the door closed.

"Always, Evelyn." His reply was warm before the latch clicked shut.

The garden paths bustled with activity as I made my way through. Some pack members offered cheerful greetings while others hurried past with purposeful strides.

I schooled my features, hoping no trace of my earlier tears remained as I approached Vivienne's table. Her back was turned, the citrusy aroma of lemonade drifting through the air.

"Hello," I announced as I circled to face her.

"Evelyn! I'm delighted you came." Vivienne's smile radiated genuine warmth.

"Please, call me Evie." I settled into my chair, taking a refreshing sip from my own lemonade glass.

"Of course, Evie." Her eyes crinkled at the corners as servers arrived with platters of fresh fruit, an assortment of sandwiches, chilled pasta salad, and yogurt parfaits.

"Would anyone care for anything else?" The unfamiliar server - one of the recent transfers from Silvercrest Pack - stood attentively.

"I'm perfectly content, thank you. Everything looks wonderful." I offered her a polite smile.

"Same for me, thank you." Vivienne added. The young woman bowed slightly before retreating.

"Thank you for making time. We've barely had a proper conversation since..."

"Everything's been chaotic lately. Isn't today your moving day?" The realization struck me suddenly.

"It is. I planned to handle that after our meal. I'd hoped we might have more time to talk beforehand, but I'm simply grateful to be here at all."

"That was my intention too, though I'll admit I've been... struggling with everything." I selected some berries and a chicken salad sandwich while Vivienne mirrored my actions.

"Would you like to share what's troubling you?" Vivienne's question held no pressure, only concern.

"I'm not entirely certain myself. My whole life, I believed you and Xavier were dead. Of course I fantasized about meeting you, but those were just childish dreams. Now that you're actually here, I find myself unexpectedly angry. Logically, I know I had a far better life than if you'd kept me. My mind understands that perfectly. But my heart can't reconcile why Xavier never once tried to contact either of us. Part of me wants to be selfish, to say you could have bribed a guard to send messages, but I know that wasn't realistic either."

"If I could rewrite history, I would have taken you and fled with Xavier. That thought haunted me daily in that cell. Eventually, I had to forgive myself or go mad. Seeing you now - strong, healthy, alive - I don't regret my choice. Especially after twenty years imprisoned. If we'd run and been caught... you would have suffered far worse. I'm not asking for forgiveness or trying to replace your mother. I just... I'd like the chance to know you."
###Chapter 0370

"I'll try. Honestly, I've been so swamped with other responsibilities that I'm not sure I have the emotional bandwidth for anything else right now."

Vivienne nodded as she popped a strawberry into her mouth. "What's keeping you so busy?"

"I want my legacy as Luna to be about helping kids who just need someone to believe in them. I was academically gifted, but as a child, I struggled. It wasn’t until Evelyn noticed me and gave me a chance that I proved myself. I just needed someone to believe in me. So now, I’m building programs to help kids—no matter their age or struggles—have a safe place to grow. On top of that, we're constructing new houses and integrating new members into our pack. Then there’s my Luna ceremony, which I haven’t even started planning, and the Halloween event. When Grayson and I mated, things were just beginning with Evelyn and Dominic, so I’m still learning how to be a proper Luna."

I didn’t mention anything about Raphael. Like Nathan said, there hasn’t been an actual threat against me yet.

"That’s beautiful," Vivienne said. "You know, when I was growing up, my father started something similar. Nightshade used to be a joyful place. Kids ran freely, we had pack barbecues, and even held friendly sparring matches to encourage camaraderie. Dad noticed the younger ones getting bullied and wanted a space where they could train without pressure from the more athletic kids. He always said some people just need extra support—even if they weren’t warriors, they still deserved to be strong."

"Really?" I asked, intrigued.

"He was so proud of it. My father was a proud man. Grayson reminds me of him." Vivienne gazed up at the sky. "Probably more affectionate in private, but fiercely protective."



"Grayson is definitely protective," I agreed, scooping some yogurt into my mouth.

"Have you two ever fought?" Vivienne asked, turning to me.

"Just petty arguments, really."

"Well, whatever it is, remember he probably has your best interests at heart. My dad used to do things I hated, but looking back, it was always out of love."

"Like what?" I pressed, eager to learn more about him.

"Oh, little things—like insisting I have a bodyguard or making me finish all my vegetables. When I got older, it was banning me from late-night parties. 'Nothing good happens after midnight,' he’d say. I used to get so mad I’d sneak out the window!" Vivienne laughed, and I couldn’t help but smile.

"Did you ever get caught?"

"Every single time. But it never stopped me. Though it did earn me a bad reputation. People assumed I was up to no good—said I was making the Alpha look weak. 'If he can’t control his own daughter, how can he lead a pack?'"

"Did he punish you?"

"Not physically. He’d yell, say he was disappointed, or make me do manual labor. But I was popular—my friends would always come help. Dad never figured out how I finished so fast."

"Was he strict?"

"Extremely. He’d loosen up occasionally, but getting a smile out of him was rare. People told me he was friendlier before becoming Alpha. Still, he read me bedtime stories and watched movies with me."



"He sounds like he loved you," I concluded.

"He did. But he often forgot I had feelings—that I couldn’t just shut them off like he could."

"What do you mean?"

Vivienne’s expression darkened. "Dad wanted me to train with the warriors. He’d get furious if I cried or showed weakness. He believed I should’ve been able to handle it without complaint."

###Chapter 0371

"He wanted you to be strong and independent."

"That's one perspective. The other is that he was cruel and mistreated me."

"Do you honestly believe that was his true motive?" I countered.

"And do you truly think your argument with Grayson reflects his real intentions?" Her words froze me mid-motion. My fork hovered halfway to my lips, suspended in the air. "It's obvious you've been crying. There are always two sides to every story. Are you only seeing yours, or are you trying to understand his?"

The way Vivienne flipped the conversation was masterful. And she wasn't wrong. Sebastian had done everything he believed necessary. It might not have been enough, but in his mind, he had done his best. Would I have acted differently? She had been confined to limited outings, guarded constantly, even forced to close her business.

Grayson was doing what he thought was right. While my feelings weren't invalid, Sebastian likely took them as a lack of faith in his ability to protect me—which couldn't be further from the truth. Yet Vivienne had trusted she was safe too.

"So," Vivienne shifted topics abruptly, pulling me from my thoughts, "do you think you're carrying a boy or a girl?"

"Actually," I admitted for the first time aloud, "I have this strange feeling there might be two in there."

"Twins!" Her face lit up with delight. Setting her fork down, she pushed her plate aside and leaned back. "That would be incredible. What makes you think so?"

"It's just a hunch. My symptoms are milder than Evelyn's, and she's a bit further along than I am."

"Every pregnancy is different. I showed early with you," Vivienne mused, nodding.

"I can't decide if I'm enjoying this or not. It's surreal—my body doesn’t feel like mine anymore. Everything’s different. Tastes, how clothes fit, even scents. I barely recognize myself."

"Pregnancy is both brutal and beautiful. Some women despise every moment of it."

"Really?"

"Oh, absolutely. Especially those with severe morning sickness or who start swelling by eight weeks. It’s not all glowing skin and baby kicks."

"Did you enjoy being pregnant?" I ventured.

She sighed. "It wasn’t exactly a highlight. I was thrilled to be carrying you, but terrified for your safety. I might’ve enjoyed it more if I could’ve worn cute maternity dresses or shown off my bump at gatherings. But Damian kept me locked away, barely letting me step outside. When I did, it was usually to clean or run errands."

"Oh." I didn’t know how to respond.

"When you were born, my heart shattered from how much I loved you. So perfect, so tiny. Giving you to Xavier was the hardest thing I’ve ever done—and I’ve done some... questionable things."

"You seem to have adjusted well to pack life here," I said, steering the conversation away from her painful past. "It must’ve been difficult, transitioning from the cells to this."

"I adore living here," she admitted. "Actually, I had a lovely chat with a young woman knocking on your office door earlier."

"Really? When was this?" I asked, startled.

"Right before you came home. She was trying to see if you were inside. Cute girl, though the pink hair was a bit much, and the makeup was heavy."

"Pink hair?"

"Vibrant pink, with thick makeup. Wonder if her mate likes it," Vivienne mused, more to herself.

"I don’t recall anyone in my pack with pink hair."

"Maybe she dyed it today. I may be old, but that hair was unmistakably pink." She shifted in her seat. "I should get going, though. Lots to do."

###Chapter 0372

"Oh!" I gasped when I checked the time. The golden afternoon light had faded into dusk. "We've been talking much longer than I realized."

Vivienne's laughter tinkled like wind chimes. "I was enjoying our conversation too much to cut it short. But now I really must gather my essentials and settle into the house before nightfall."

"I hope you'll find it comfortable," I said as we rose from the patio chairs. The evening breeze carried the scent of jasmine from the garden.

"Darling," Vivienne chuckled, pulling me into an unexpected embrace, "after years in confinement, even a broom closet would feel like a palace." Though her arms around me didn't spark maternal recognition, the warmth was undeniable.

"We should do this again soon," I said sincerely, meaning every word.

"Absolutely." Vivienne cupped my cheek briefly before turning to leave. "What a delightful afternoon!" Her voice carried across the lawn.

"Goodbye!" I called after her, then headed toward the front entrance.

To my surprise, Sebastian, Evelyn, Nathan and Grayson were lounging on the front steps like a pack of lazy wolves. "I take it you finished with the boxes?" I asked, leaning against the porch railing. Evelyn sat opposite Sebastian, Nathan perched on the top step, while Grayson draped himself over the banister like a panther.

"All done," Evelyn confirmed. "Found some interesting things, but no shocking revelations. How was lunch with Vivienne?"

"Surprisingly pleasant," I admitted.

"Well, we should probably head home," Evelyn said, glancing at Sebastian. He stood and pulled her up with effortless grace.

"You're welcome to stay for dinner. I'm making something special," I offered.

Evelyn's nose twitched with interest. "What's on the menu?"

"Spicy Tuna Rolls."

Nathan's eyebrows shot up. "I thought you couldn't have tuna or sushi?"

"Actually, tuna in moderation is fine," I explained. "One serving this week won't hurt, and cooked sushi is perfectly safe. As long as the fish is cooked through, it's acceptable."

"Fair enough," Nathan conceded, standing. "But I'll have to pass. Cassandra and I have some... matters to discuss." He disappeared inside without another word.

"Good luck," I called after him, smiling at his retreating back.

"Thanks, I'll need it," floated his muffled reply.

"So, did I tempt you to stay?" I asked Evelyn.

"You certainly did," she sighed dramatically.

"Perfect. I need a few ingredients from the store. Would you mind picking them up?"

"Of course. What do you need?"

"Seaweed and sesame seeds."

"Essential sushi components," Evelyn noted with an approving nod as they descended the remaining steps.

"Exactly." I watched as Evelyn and Sebastian walked past me to their cars, leaving Grayson and me alone on the porch. His intense gaze never wavered from me.

"Enjoy your brunch?" Grayson finally broke the silence, unfolding his long frame from the railing and descending toward me.

"I wouldn't mind repeating it," I admitted, not moving from my spot. He stopped an arm's length away, close enough to smell his cedarwood scent. "I suppose we should talk."

"Let's discuss it on the drive home," Grayson suggested, his hand settling gently on the small of my back as he guided me to his car.

After opening my door with old-world courtesy, he waited until I was settled before closing it. The leather seats still carried the faint aroma of his cologne. When he slid into the driver's seat, I waited until the engine purred to life before speaking.

"I understand Sebastian did everything possible to protect Evelyn," I began, watching the trees blur past the window. "I don't blame either of you for what happened. What terrifies me is that despite all those precautions, she still got taken." My fingers twisted in my lap. "I'm not a fighter like Evelyn. She had the skills and temperament to face Theodore. I don't. I don't have that warrior's spirit."

###Chapter 0373

"So, you're upset because you don't think you're strong enough to survive a kidnapping?" Grayson asked, his voice laced with concern.

"Yeah. I know you can protect me. That's not the issue. You'd know if I was lying."

"I just wish you'd told me this privately." Grayson sighed, rubbing his temples. "Is there anything specific you'd like me to do? Extra security? Changes to your routine?"

"What do you mean?" I frowned, not fully grasping his question.

"What would make you feel safer? I'll build you a panic room—solid steel, bulletproof, whatever you want."

"Like you said, there hasn't actually been a threat. I think I'm just extra worried because I'm pregnant. I keep thinking something might happen to them."

"Them?" Grayson's gaze sharpened as he pulled into our driveway.

"I have a feeling there are two in here." I placed a hand on my stomach.

Grayson killed the engine and reached over, his large palm covering mine. "Two babies?"

"We should get an ultrasound to confirm." I leaned my head against his shoulder, and he pressed a kiss to my forehead.

"Schedule it. I want to know how many we're having." He pulled back and stepped out of the car.

"I've been putting it off," I admitted, following him inside.

"Why?"

"I don't like the idea of being examined. It makes me uncomfortable."

As we walked in, I couldn't help but smile. This was home. I'd rearranged the furniture like Evelyn suggested and bought new pieces. The walls were now a soft sage green, the light gray couch and recliners complemented by black and cream accents. Lush green plants filled the corners, some even hanging from the ceiling. It was perfect.

"You can't avoid checkups, but we can ask the doctor to minimize them," Grayson said, grabbing a water bottle from the kitchen.

I started prepping ingredients for spicy tuna sushi, pulling out my cast-iron skillet. "Pan-frying the tuna will be better this way."

Grayson leaned against the counter, watching me. "How was brunch?"

"Fine. Though I'm starting to think Evelyn has permanent brain damage."

"Why?" He raised a brow as I measured rice into the pot.

"She claimed she talked to some girl with pink hair and heavy makeup who approached her near our office."

"Interesting." Grayson sat on a stool. "I don’t recall any pack members with pink hair."

"Unless it was a wig."

Before he could respond, the doorbell rang. "Come in!" Grayson called.

"Oh wow! This place looks amazing!" Evelyn stood in the living room, eyes wide as she took in the changes.

"I'm glad you like it!"

"I'm gonna show Sebastian the garden," Grayson said, grabbing two beers from the fridge.

"Want to see it?" I asked Sebastian.

"I've heard you're great at gardening. Been thinking of starting my own."

"Seriously?" Evelyn shot him a disbelieving look.

"See? Still mysteries in our lives." Sebastian smirked as they headed outside.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "They just wanted to talk privately."

"What couldn’t they say in front of us?" I asked, searing the tuna.

"Probably something about the Luna ceremonies." She shrugged, unconcerned.

Grayson’s POV

"That wasn’t subtle," Sebastian muttered, taking the beer from me as we surveyed the garden. How Audrey found time to maintain this, I had no idea.

###Chapter 0374

"It just came to me in a flash." I took a slow sip of my drink before pulling the crumpled note from my pocket and handing it to Sebastian.

His brows furrowed as he unfolded it. "What is this?"

"I found it wedged against the wall in my office. Like someone slipped it under the door, and when it opened, it got pushed aside. No clue how long it's been there, but Sophia mentioned seeing Vivienne talking to a girl with bright pink hair and heavy makeup. After reading this, I think it might’ve been a disguise."

Sebastian scanned the words. "Audrey is in danger. Protect her at all costs. They're coming." His expression darkened. "This is vague as hell. And the handwriting is a mess."

"I have a theory."

"Let’s hear it."

"I haven’t told you yet, but when you were inside with Scarlett, I got a call. Xavier lied to me. The dead man we found? Xavier killed him. He carved that message into the guy’s chest. The victim was part of Raphael’s pack. He told me Magnus burned down Xavier’s safe house. Apparently, Xavier was followed—watched as he made his way back to our territory, saw a girl jump the fence, and tailed her straight to Magnus’s place."

"No way."

"Yeah. Turns out Magnus has a mate from my pack. Xavier kept all of this from me."

"You think Xavier’s playing both sides?" Sebastian downed half his beer in one gulp.

"Not sure. He lied, but I don’t see him handing Audrey over. I think Xavier has his own agenda—one that involves sacrificing me to save her."

"Who’s the girl?"

"He didn’t know. Couldn’t get a photo. But if Magnus is using his mate to spy on us, she’d definitely be in disguise."

Sebastian scoffed, handing the note back. "You really think she left this?"

"Unless she’s torn between loyalty to me and fear of her mate. Or worse—he’s forcing her."

"If that’s the case, why not just come to you directly?"

"I had another idea."

"Which is?"

"Feed her false intel. Let her take it back to Magnus. Make him think he’s getting insider info while we use it to lure them out."

Sebastian smirked. "Why not just find where Raphael and Magnus are hiding and end this?"

"The guy said they have houses but never stay long. He hasn’t been with them long enough to know more."

I sighed. "If we play this right, we might take out their buyers too."

"That’s risky. Especially with this note targeting Audrey."

"I know."

"Still, it’s a solid plan. Let them think they’ve breached your defenses first."

"I’ll need hidden cameras to ID the girl." I wasn’t as thrilled as Sebastian sounded.

"Are you telling Audrey about this?"

"I have to. I promised her full transparency when it comes to her safety. She needs to clear out of that office now."

"Limit her exposure immediately. We can’t ignore a direct threat, even if it’s just a note. And after what Seraphina said… Raphael and Magnus might be planning something bigger than we realize."

"Hopefully, my guy digs up more. We can’t trust Xavier."

"What are you doing about him?"

"Nothing yet. I’ll wait and see how deep he digs his own grave. By carving that message, he assumed I was the only Alpha—that if Raphael challenged me, one of us would die, and the problem would be over. But if that happened… what’s his endgame? Take Audrey and run?"

###Chapter 0375

"What about the child?"

"I’d expect you to track them down and raise them properly. Saving Audrey would be ideal, of course."

"Obviously. Let’s tackle this step by step. Clear out your office. Leave false leads and see how far they’ll take this."

"That’s the issue—what do I leave for them to find?"

"Based on what we found in the boxes and the house, they’re probably after blueprints."

"I could forge some."

"Do you still have the original ones? The ones the architect showed you before all the changes were made to Audrey’s new buildings?"

"I’m sure they’re here… somewhere."

"Find them. Use those. Install a dozen more hidden cameras and have someone monitor them around the clock."

"Fine. I’ll start on that first thing tomorrow. I’ll update you once we’re ready to move forward."

"Sounds good. Make sure nothing seems out of place. We don’t want to spook her." Sebastian grabbed our empty bottles and tossed them into the recycling bin.

"Boys! Dinner’s ready!" Amelia called from the window.

"Let’s keep this between us for tonight. I want Audrey to have one last peaceful evening before her world gets turned upside down."



"I know Xavier lied to me, but I doubt he’d hand Audrey over. I think he has his own agenda—sacrificing me to save her."

"Who’s the girl?"

"He didn’t know and couldn’t get a photo. But if Magnus is using her to extract intel from my pack, they’d likely use someone disposable."

"You don’t really think she left the note?" Sebastian handed it back to me.

"Unless she’s torn between loyalty to me and pressure from her mate. Maybe she’s being forced."

"If that’s the case, why not just come to you directly?" Sebastian asked.

"I had a different idea."

"What?"

"Plant false intel for them to steal. Let Magnus think he’s getting valuable information while we use it to our advantage."

"Did your contact not know where Magnus and Lorenzo are staying? Couldn’t we just eliminate them?"

"He said they own properties but rarely stay in them. He was only around them briefly."

"I wish it were that simple. If we play the long game, we might take out their entire network."

"That’s risky. Especially since the note mentioned Audrey."

"I know."

Still, it’s an intriguing plan. Let them break in, thinking they’ve stolen something valuable.



"I’ll need to install discreet cameras to identify the girl." I wasn’t as enthusiastic as Sebastian made it sound.

"Are you going to tell Audrey about this?"

"I have to. I promised her full transparency when it came to her safety. She needs to vacate that office immediately."

"You should start limiting her exposure now. We can’t ignore a direct threat, even if it’s just a note. And after what Seraphina said… Lorenzo and Magnus might be planning something bigger than we realize."

"Hopefully, my contact can uncover more. We can’t rely on Xavier."

"What are you going to do about him?"

"Nothing for now. I’ll wait and see how deep he digs his own grave. After what he carved into that man’s chest, he believes I’m the only Alpha. If Lorenzo challenges me, he thinks either I kill Lorenzo and end this, or Lorenzo kills me. I’m not sure what his plan is if that happens—take Audrey and run?"

###Chapter 0376

"Just one!" Evelyn smirked at me as she handed over the ultrasound photos.

"What exactly am I looking at?" I asked, squinting at the blurry image.

"This is the baby." Audrey pulled the pictures toward her and pointed to a tiny bean-shaped blob.

"I'll take your word for it," I said, handing them back.

"You don't think your little niece or nephew is adorable?" Evelyn cradled the photos, her expression softening.

"It looks just like you," I teased.

"Since we're identical twins, that insult doesn’t land the way you think it does." She rolled her eyes. "Have you gotten a sonogram yet?" she asked Audrey.

"Not yet. I've been putting it off, but I know I should." Audrey poked at her sushi absentmindedly.

"I loved it. Seeing our baby for the first time was... magical." Evelyn’s voice was uncharacteristically tender.

Trying to shift the focus away from Audrey, I smirked. "Wow, sis. Who knew you had such a mushy side? If I didn’t know better, I’d say you’ve gone soft."

"Kiss my ass." Scarlett whipped her head around to glare at me. I just threw my head back and laughed.

"Thanks for dinner, but I think we should head home," Sebastian said, though he was clearly amused by our bickering.

"There’s only so much of your squabbling a person can take in one night."

"We do not squabble," I protested, feigning offense.

"You do, and for adults... it’s honestly pathetic." Audrey shot me a look before gathering our plates and carrying them to the sink.

"I have no idea what you’re talking about." Scarlett backed me up as our mates ganged up on us.

"You’re full of it." Sebastian crossed his arms, giving her a pointed look.

"And you can sleep on the couch!" Scarlett snapped back.

"Give him hell," I whispered—though everyone heard me. I pulled her into a quick hug and nudged her toward Sebastian. "She’s your problem now, but I love you, sis!"

Scarlett looked at me like I’d just betrayed her. "Jackass," she muttered as they headed for the door.

"Thanks for coming!" Audrey called after them. Sebastian raised a hand in farewell before the door clicked shut.

"That went well," I said, grinning as I helped Audrey with the dishes. "First time hosting in this house, and we didn’t burn anything down."

"I know. The bar setup and seating worked perfectly." She nodded in agreement. I scrubbed a plate while she wiped down the counter. "Want to watch a movie tonight?"

"Actually, there’s something important I need to talk to you about."

"Are you finally going to tell me what you and Sebastian needed to discuss in private?"

"It wasn’t about secrecy—just bouncing ideas around. We work best when it’s just us talking, no outside opinions muddying things."

"Like your mates?" Audrey pressed.

"Exactly. Sebastian and I figure things out better alone. We call each other out without hesitation, and it’s easier when you and Scarlett aren’t there. We can be brutally honest without worrying about hurt feelings." I dried my hands on a towel before tossing it over my shoulder. "But that’s why I’m telling you now. I want to run our discussion by you and see what you think. Your opinion matters—I just needed to sort through my own thoughts first."

"Sounds like a cop-out to me," Audrey said, leaning against the counter.

I smirked, then lifted her onto the countertop. "It’s just how I operate." I tangled my fingers in her hair, tilting her head back as my lips grazed her neck.

"Oh… I want…" Her words dissolved into a breathy sigh as I trailed kisses lower. My hand slipped easily beneath her dress, finding the warmth between her thighs.

###Chapter 0377

"I adore how your body reacts to me." My lips brushed against her ear as my fingers traced the edge of her lace panties.

"Grayson..." Audrey moaned, arching into my touch. Slipping a finger inside, I had to grit my teeth to maintain control. She was intoxicating, her warmth driving me wild.

I pushed her dress up, and she eagerly helped me slide it off. Dropping to my knees, the kitchen counter was the perfect height to taste her.

Audrey braced her feet on my shoulders, leaning back to give me full access. Dragging her closer to the edge, I watched as she shuddered under every flick of my tongue, every stroke of my fingers. By the time I let her catch her breath, she'd already come undone three times.

Her legs trembled so violently I had to scoop her up and carry her to our bed. "Fuck me... now," she panted, nails digging into my shoulders.

"Oh, I plan to." I set her down, making her peel off the rest of her dress before letting her collapse onto the sheets. The fabric was expensive, but she loved it—though right now, comfort was all that mattered.

What I didn’t expect was Audrey flipping me onto my back. With quick fingers, she undid my pants, freeing my aching length before taking me into her mouth. The heat of her lips had me groaning, my hands tangling in her hair.

She was still learning, but damn if she wasn’t perfect. "Audrey—" My hips jerked as she quickened her pace, her nails raking down my stomach. When she reached just the right spot, I came hard, my vision whiting out.

I collapsed onto the bed, chest heaving, as she wiped her lips with a smirk. "So," she murmured, "what did you want to talk about?"

My gaze raked over her—black bra clinging to her curves, stomach taut above soaked panties. I yanked her down onto me. "Found a letter hidden in the office."

Rolling her beneath me, I tore off her panties, fingers already teasing her swollen flesh. "What did... it say?" she gasped, arching into my touch.

"It was a threat. Said an attack was coming." My thumb circled her clit, drawing a sharp cry from her lips.

"So someone’s targeting me now?" Her fingers twisted in my hair as I dipped lower, mouth closing over her breast.

"Seems that way," I mumbled against her skin.

"What do we do?" Her voice was breathless, needy.

"Turns out, the pink-haired girl is involved." I dragged my tongue up her neck, sucking hard on my mark. She writhed, thighs clamping around my hips.

"How?" Her nails bit into my skin.

"Think she’s trying to break into the office. I’ve got someone tailing Xavier—he’s lied about everything." I met her gaze, watching realization dawn.

"What?"

"Exactly. He’s the one who killed that man at the house. Buried him there. And he caught a girl jumping our fence—straight into Magnus’s arms."

My fingers worked faster, and Audrey fisted the sheets, struggling to focus. "Who... was she?"

"No clue." Another orgasm ripped through her, and I let her ride it out, pressing soft kisses to her skin. Only when she stilled did I continue. "We’re setting a trap."

"Trap?" Her eyelids fluttered, fighting exhaustion.

"Empty the office of anything important. Plant fake blueprints, documents—whatever. Set up cameras. See what she steals and who she takes it to. If we can bring down the whole operation, we have to try."

###Chapter 0378


"Operation as in what they were doing at the house?" Audrey asked, her fingers tracing absentminded circles on my chest.

"Exactly." My grip tightened slightly around her neck, my thumb brushing the soft curve of her cheek. "Your safety comes first. Always."

"I trust you." Her gaze locked onto mine, unwavering.

"Then let me do what needs to be done."

"Fine. But on one condition." She tilted her chin up, stubborn as ever. "I want you with me. Not a guard. You."

I exhaled sharply. "That means training. Fighting. Everything I’ve been trying to shield you from."

"I know." She shrugged, though her voice was firm. "I’ll work remotely. Laptop, phone—I’ll make it work."

The sheer determination in her eyes made my chest tighten. I’d never loved anyone this much.

My palm settled over the swell of her stomach, and then—

A flutter.

"Hmm." Audrey’s lips curled into a slow smile.

"Was that—?"

"Mhm. Our baby." She leaned into me, resting her head against my arm as we both focused on the tiny movement beneath my hand.

"It moved." I pressed my ear to her belly, grinning when her fingers tangled in my hair.

"They like your voice," she murmured.

"Daddy loves you," I whispered—and felt another kick in response.

Audrey laughed. "I think they love you too."

"First time you’ve felt it?" I glanced up.

"Yeah." She wrinkled her nose. "Weird, right? Like there’s a tiny little alien in there."

"Did you just call our child an alien?" I yanked her on top of me before she could protest.

"Sebastian—!" She shrieked, laughing as she landed squarely in my lap.

"Anything else you need to tell me?" She rocked her hips, teasing.

"That was the gist of it." I gritted my teeth, fighting the urge to flip her over right then.

"Tired already?" She tilted her head, all innocence.

I folded my arms behind my head, watching her with a smirk. "Maybe. But I could be… persuaded."

Her eyes narrowed. "Oh?" She slid off me, her fingers trailing down my chest—then lower. "You don’t look satisfied yet."

"That’s your job, not mine." I arched a brow. "I did my part."

"Did you?" Her hand wrapped around me, stroking slowly. I hissed.

"You telling me you’re still not happy?" I didn’t move, letting her play.

"Hardly." She bit her lip, feigning innocence. "I barely even—"

I sat up in one swift motion, hauling her against me. "Mission accepted."

Then I slammed her down onto me.

Her gasp was music to my ears.

I flipped her onto the bed, driving into her with a growl. One hand fisted in her hair, arching her back. She came fast—but I wasn’t done.

Her nails clawed at the sheets. Her breath came in ragged pants.

Still not enough.

I flipped her again, biting her neck as we both shattered.

For a long moment, she just lay there, limp. Then she turned her head, grinning.

"That’s how you deliver bad news?"

I chuckled. "Noted.

###Chapter 0379
Audrey POV

"Almost ready?" Grayson's knuckles rapped against the bathroom door. I stood before the mirror, adjusting the sapphire blue gown that hugged my curves perfectly. The delicate straps draped over my shoulders, leading into a daring plunge at the front. The corset-style back cinched my waist before the fabric cascaded into a shimmering train. Every movement sent tiny sparkles dancing across the silk.

"Just a minute," I murmured, barely registering his words. My curls were pinned half-up, cheeks flushed with a rosy glow. The jewelry—simple yet elegant—completed the look.

"We'll be late if we don't leave soon." His voice held a hint of impatience. "Can I come in?"

With a sigh, I twisted the knob and pulled the door open. "Done."

Grayson's lips curved into a soft smile as he knelt, taking the strappy heels from my hands. "You look breathtaking."

"Thanks."

"When's the ultrasound?" he asked, sliding the shoes onto my feet.

"Tomorrow. The doctor arranged a private session."

"You're nervous." It wasn't a question.

"I don’t know why. Maybe because I swear there are twins in here." My palm settled over the swell of my stomach.

Grayson leaned down, pressing a kiss to my belly before straightening. His arms wrapped around me, steadying me as we headed out.

"Twins would be incredible. A built-in best friend from day one." He opened the car door for me, his touch lingering.

"Two babies at once sounds exhausting," I muttered, sinking into the seat.

"You have me." His grin was effortless as the engine purred to life. "But we need to talk about today." His tone shifted, serious now.

"I know. We have to be careful, but this is Evelyn’s night. I don’t want to overshadow her."

"Your safety matters more than any ceremony." His fingers laced through mine. "The warriors will be stationed everywhere. Sebastian arranged extra security—metal detectors, wands, the works."

"That’s extreme. Do you really think anyone would try something with all the Alphas there?"

"Better safe than sorry." His jaw tightened. "Though I’m sure the Alphas appreciate the caution."

"What do we tell people when they ask why we’re being so strict?"

"We’re prioritizing pack safety." His voice left no room for argument.

"Anything else I should know?" We were nearing the venue, and I didn’t want to draw attention.

"Signs. Cassandra won’t be there, so Nathan will stay close. Basic rules—don’t leave the party without him or me, don’t go anywhere alone. We’ve set up a private room if you need to rest."

"Thank the Moon Goddess. These heels won’t last long." Two inches, but with my balance off lately, they felt like stilts.

Grayson parked but caught my wrist before I could exit. "One last thing. Non-negotiable. Keep your mind link open to me. No exceptions. If you shut me out, I’ll tear the place apart to find you."

His gaze burned into mine, leaving no doubt—this wasn’t a request. It was a vow.

###Chapter 0380

"I can handle this," I assured him. The way Grayson looked at me suggested this was more about his own reassurance than actual security concerns.

"Thank you," Grayson murmured before leaning in to brush his lips against mine. As he exited the car, I waited patiently for his assistance, not trusting my unsteady balance in these heels. The last thing I needed was to embarrass myself in front of all these guests streaming into the venue.

Nathan stood rigidly at the entrance, his expression grave. "Alpha. Luna," he greeted with formal precision.

"Beta," Grayson acknowledged, adjusting his suit jacket with a quick tug. His sweeping gaze told me this would be the tone for the entire evening.

"All guests have arrived," Nathan reported. "The ceremony begins in ten minutes."

"Good. Take your seats. I need to find Scarlett." Grayson pressed a quick kiss to my cheek before disappearing into the crowd.

"Would you like to visit the restroom before we're seated?" Nathan asked, positioning himself between me and the passing guests.

"No, but I'd appreciate your arm for support," I admitted. "These heels aren't doing my balance any favors."

Nathan offered his arm without comment. I considered making conversation, but his attention remained fixed on scanning our surroundings as we navigated to our seats. The transformed ballroom took my breath away - round tables draped in midnight blue linens, each centerpiece a constellation of flickering candles. The dimmed overhead lights allowed hundreds of twinkling fairy lights to mimic a starry sky above us.



"Here we are," Nathan announced, guiding me to the head table. Place cards marked each seat - Nathan to my left, Grayson to my right, with Oliver and Sophia presumably filling the remaining chairs. Sebastian and Evelyn would likely be seated elsewhere.

At the end of the aisle stood a wooden altar encircled by indigo and black petals. Nearby, a small table displayed the ceremonial chalice and knife, flanked by two pristine cloths.

My gaze traveled across the room, noting the strategic placement of warriors. Every few feet stood another broad-shouldered guard in tactical black, discreet earpieces their only visible equipment. Some belonged to our pack, others to Sebastian's.

"Is there reason to expect trouble?" I asked Nathan.

"Better safe than sorry," he replied absently, his attention elsewhere.

"Hey there!" Sophia's cheerful voice came from behind me. I turned with genuine relief at seeing a friendly face.

"Hello! No little one tonight?" I asked.

"Babysitter's night off," Sophia grinned, settling into her chair while Oliver remained standing. Nathan immediately moved to join him, their hushed conversation lost in the ambient noise.

"I'm glad you get some time to yourselves!"

"How are you holding up?" Sophia asked, her eyes dropping to my midsection.

"Like a beached whale," I laughed. "My center of gravity's completely off these days."

"You've definitely popped," Sophia observed. While I appreciated finally looking properly pregnant, the physical changes were wreaking havoc on my coordination.

"Tell me about it. I know I'm not that big yet, but I feel like I've doubled in size overnight."

"Are you at our table?" Grayson's voice echoed in my mind.

"Just chatting with Sophia," I replied mentally. Though he didn't respond, I could feel his presence lingering at the edges of my consciousness, quietly monitoring our conversation.

###Chapter 0381

"It never truly gets easier. The further along you are, the more you question your own equilibrium. And once the baby arrives, you'll realize just how much your body has transformed. Nothing will ever be the same again." Sophia took a sip of her water, and suddenly, I wished I had some too.

The lights dimmed further, and the music shifted. Everyone rose as Grayson and Evelyn turned the corner. Nathan offered me his hand as I steadied myself to stand.

I hadn’t even noticed when Sebastian and another Alpha stepped up to the altar. As Grayson and Evelyn walked down the aisle, her gaze never left him. She wore a fitted white gown adorned with delicate beading, long sleeves draping elegantly over her shoulders, the fabric flaring into a mermaid silhouette with a flowing train. Her hair was styled in a low, intricate bun—Sophia must have done it, because Evelyn could never manage such elegance on her own.

"She looks absolutely stunning," I whispered as they passed.

"Without a doubt," Nathan murmured, standing close—almost too close for comfort. But since I knew him, I didn’t mind.

Grayson handed Evelyn off to Sebastian before making his way to me. Nathan took a step back, and Grayson wrapped his arm around my waist, pulling me against him. The two exchanged a silent nod—an unspoken understanding that Grayson was now responsible for me. Nathan visibly relaxed, though his posture remained impeccable.

"Ladies and gentlemen, at long last, we gather to celebrate the union of Alpha Sebastian and Luna Evelyn." The officiant’s voice carried through the space. "It is my honor to stand in for Alpha Benjamin and officiate this ceremony. Alpha Benjamin was not just a formidable ally but a cherished friend."

A ripple of laughter spread through the crowd as he added, "Luna Evelyn, I trust you’re aware that he leaves his socks scattered everywhere and never remembers to put the toilet seat down?"

"Your bond was forged months ago, though Luna Evelyn was already sworn into the pack. Yet, we honor tradition tonight. You’ve proven time and again what it means to stand together through every trial. Danger has tested you, yet here you stand—unbreakable. We’ll begin with the vows you’ve written, followed by the unity ceremony. Alpha Sebastian…"

"Who’s officiating?" I mind-linked Grayson.

"Alpha Gregory. He’s been our ally for years."

Sebastian’s voice was steady, his gaze locked onto Evelyn. "Evelyn, from the moment I walked into your tattoo shop, I knew you were meant to be mine. Your beauty stole my breath so completely, I forgot why I’d even come in. And that hasn’t changed. Every time I see you, my chest tightens, and the world narrows to just you."

He continued, his voice thick with emotion. "I’ve seen you bleed, cry, laugh, and yes, even yell a time or two. You’ve brought more chaos into my life than I ever thought I’d survive—yet I wouldn’t change a single moment. It’s made us stronger. Not just for ourselves, but for our people. You’ve taught me to lead with my heart, not just my mind. Because of you, I’m a better man."

His hand rested gently over her stomach. "And now, with our child on the way, I have no doubt you’ll teach me how to be a father too. I can’t imagine this journey with anyone else. You’re not just my mate—you’re my soul. I love you more than words could ever say."

A single tear escaped, tracing a warm path down my cheek.

###Chapter 0382

"Evelyn Andrews, please say your vows."

The chapel fell silent as all eyes turned to Evelyn. She took a deep breath, her fingers trembling slightly as she reached for Sebastian's hands.

"Sebastian," she began, her voice steady despite the emotions swirling within her. "From the very first moment we met, you never doubted that we were destined to be mates. Even when I questioned everything—when I was afraid, uncertain—you never wavered. You saw my fears, my insecurities, and instead of using them against me, you turned them into my strengths."

A soft murmur of agreement rippled through the crowd. Grayson, standing nearby, swelled with pride for his sister.

"You taught me what it means to love without conditions," Evelyn continued, her gaze locked onto Sebastian's. "You showed me what safety truly feels like. You believed in me when I didn’t believe in myself. Our bond isn’t just built on respect—it’s built on friendship, on laughter, on the way we bicker like children one moment and stand unshakable together the next."

A few chuckles broke out at that.

"I’ve laughed with you, cried with you, yelled at you," she admitted, grinning. "And even on our worst days, I wouldn’t trade this—trade us—for anything in the world. I promise to keep driving you absolutely insane, but I also promise to honor you, respect you, and stand by you in everything. And Sebastian… I know you’ll be an incredible father."

Her voice cracked slightly on the last words, and more than a few guests discreetly wiped their eyes.

Sebastian’s grip on her hands tightened, his expression fierce with emotion.

"Now," Alpha Gregory announced, "we will proceed to the unity ceremony."

Evelyn and Sebastian stepped forward, standing before the ancient silver chalice.

"Alpha Sebastian," Gregory intoned, "take the dagger—the same blade that has been wielded by generations of alphas before you. By shedding your blood, you bind your pack to their Luna."

Sebastian didn’t hesitate. He took the dagger and drew it swiftly across his palm, letting his blood drip into the chalice.

"As your blood mingles with the sacred vessel," Gregory continued, "you pledge an eternal vow."

Once enough blood had been given, Evelyn carefully wrapped a strip of linen around Sebastian’s hand, her touch gentle.

"With my blood," Sebastian declared, his voice resonating through the chapel, "I vow my eternal bond."

"Luna Evelyn," Gregory said, turning to her. "Now, you must do the same. Spill your blood as proof of your commitment to Alpha Sebastian and his pack."

Evelyn took the dagger. Without flinching, she sliced her palm and held it over the chalice. Her blood flowed freely, joining Sebastian’s.

"With my blood," she said firmly, "I vow my eternal bond."

Sebastian took another strip of linen and tenderly bound her wound.

Alpha Gregory lifted the chalice high. "Together, they have given a part of themselves—a sacrifice that cannot be undone. As they drink, they become one. One ruler, one soul. Two halves that form a single force."

He handed the chalice to Sebastian first.

"I, Alpha Sebastian of the Silvercrest Pack," he declared, "vow my loyalty as your mate, your Alpha, and your friend. I accept you as you are. From this day forward, let no one dare question our bond or our right to lead."

He drank deeply, then passed the chalice to Evelyn.

She took it, her fingers steady. "I, Luna Evelyn of the Silvercrest Pack, vow my loyalty as your mate, your Luna, and your friend. I accept you as you are. From this day forward, let no one dare question our bond or our right to lead."

She finished the remaining contents, then set the chalice down with finality.

They turned to face the gathered crowd, hands still clasped.

"Ladies and gentlemen," Gregory announced, "before you stand Alpha Sebastian and Luna Evelyn, united in love and purpose. They have prepared words for their pack—and for all of you."

Sebastian stepped forward, his voice strong and commanding.

"The past months have tested us all. But today marks a new beginning. Luna Evelyn and I have worked tirelessly to rebuild trust, to strengthen our pack. And let this be clear—we will tolerate no betrayal, no disrespect, no weakness. We rule with fairness, but we rule with strength. And to any who doubt us…" His gaze hardened. "They will learn the same fate as those who stood against us before."

A ripple of unease passed through some in the crowd, but most stood taller, their loyalty reaffirmed.

Evelyn squeezed his hand, her smile sharp and knowing.

The message was clear.

The Silvercrest Pack was no longer fractured.

It was whole.

And it was unstoppable.

###Chapter 0383

The tent burst into thunderous applause. "Why did Sebastian need to make that declaration now?" I mind-linked Grayson, my fingers tightening around his arm.

"Some Alphas questioned whether Sebastian could fill his father's shoes," Grayson responded through our connection. His jaw tensed. "Despite Benjamin's mistakes, he maintained strong alliances. Sebastian must prove he's equally capable of upholding them."

My eyes widened. "You're facing similar doubts?"

Grayson's grip on my hand tightened. "To a lesser degree. Our father prepared his succession carefully, unlike Benjamin's abrupt end. But I'm still young - only battled one real enemy." His piercing gaze held mine as the surrounding chatter faded to white noise.

"Will we need to make some grand statement too?" My stomach knotted at the thought.

"Different approach, same purpose," Grayson confirmed. His attention shifted briefly to Sophia. The sudden return of wedding music snapped me back to reality.

"That was absolutely breathtaking!" Sophia dabbed at her teary eyes with a lace handkerchief.

"Magical," I agreed quickly, forcing a smile.

"What's troubling you?" Grayson's voice echoed in my mind.

"Just processing the politics," I admitted. "I assumed respect came automatically until proven unworthy." I'd been busy bonding with other Lunas, oblivious to these power dynamics.

"I gave you space," Grayson replied gently. "You wanted to focus on your centers first. I planned to ease you into pack leadership after your school programs stabilized."

Alpha Gregory's voice boomed through the tent. "Please proceed to the buffet according to your table assignments." As Table One, we led the procession.

"Thank you," I murmured as Grayson helped me rise. These designer heels were coming off the moment we sat back down. His fingers interlaced with mine as we navigated the crowded aisle, only releasing when we reached the lavish spread.

"Shall I prepare your plate?" Grayson offered, already reaching for china.

"I can manage." I selected a gold-rimmed plate, starting with an arugula salad topped with candied walnuts. Next came truffle-infused pasta, followed by an assortment of delicate hors d'oeuvres. Since pregnancy cravings made me adventurous, I sampled everything - Sophia's rounded belly was proof the menu was safe.

I'd just settled into my chair when Grayson reappeared. "You should've waited," he chided gently, adjusting my shawl.

"Just wanted to sit while I could," I admitted. "Nathan's here now. Your drink preference?"

"Surprise me." He brushed his lips against my temple before disappearing again.

"Everything looks divine!" Sophia sighed as she arranged her overflowing plate. "Are you hungrier since Aurora arrived?" I asked between bites of what turned out to be an exquisite lemon-blueberry tartlet.

"More frequent cravings, but smaller portions." She patted her stomach. "Balances out, really."

Fascinating. I was about to inquire further when Grayson returned with a frosty glass of golden liquid - likely freshly squeezed lemonade with those tiny seeds floating in it.

"Perfect," I sighed after the first citrusy sip. The tartness perfectly cut through the rich flavors on my plate.

"Oliver," Grayson greeted as the beta approached with drinks for himself and Sophia. "How's the security detail holding up?"

The clinking of silverware and murmur of conversation created a comfortable hum around us, though my mind still whirred with unspoken questions about pack politics. Grayson's reassuring squeeze under the table reminded me we'd face those challenges together - when the time was right. For now, we celebrated love amidst the delicate scent of gardenias and the promise of new beginnings.

###Chapter 0384

"We're managing well. No restrictions and we actually got some decent rest last night."

Sophia beamed, her eyes sparkling. "It was heavenly. A whole five hours of uninterrupted sleep!"

"Five hours?" Nathan's eyebrows shot up in disbelief. "That's all?"

"Nathan, newborns need to feed every two to three hours," I explained, rolling my eyes. "Say we put the baby down at 8 p.m. after feeding, changing, and burping. Best-case scenario? They wake up again by 11 p.m. Then it takes another half hour to feed them, burp them, change them—and by the time they settle, it's past midnight. If you're lucky, you might squeeze in another hour or two before they're up again at 3 a.m. Rinse and repeat."

"Damn." Nathan rubbed the back of his neck, looking horrified.

Grayson smirked, taking a sip of his drink. "I can't wait."

My head whipped toward him, a grin spreading across my face. "Really?"

Nathan scoffed. "You want this?"

"It's not forever," Grayson said with a shrug. "The first six months to a year are brutal, but it gets better. That’s what nannies and betas are for." He shot Nathan a teasing look.

"Not a chance. I’m not babysitting until that kid can wipe their own ass," Nathan declared, making the whole table burst into laughter.

"One day, Nathan. One day," Sophia wheezed between giggles.

Nathan narrowed his eyes. "One day what?"

"I’ll be there when you eat those words," she shot back, pointing her fork at him. "And I’ll remind you of this exact conversation."

Leaning toward Grayson, I lowered my voice. "I need to use the restroom."

He wiped his mouth and stood, offering me his hand. "Got it."

As we stepped away, Nathan called after us. "Where are you two sneaking off to?"

I smirked over my shoulder. "To the bathroom. Gotta go properly so you can finally be happy."

Nathan groaned as I turned away, unable to suppress my laughter.

"Sometimes I seriously question his sanity," I muttered to Grayson.

"Same," he replied through our mind-link. "We really need to find a Gamma."

"I know. But how?"

"Not sure. Maybe hold a tournament? Or just appoint someone?" Grayson mused as we reached the restroom. He squeezed my hand. "Keep the link open. I'll wait right here."

Nodding, I slipped inside. "Who would you even pick?"

"I’m not—" Grayson’s voice cut off abruptly. Someone must have approached him—probably another Alpha.

Just as I sat down, the door swung open, and a group of girls bustled in.

"Did you see her? She walks like she’s got a pole shoved up her—" one sneered.

Another giggled. "Maybe I’ll just flirt with Grayson and get her out of the way."

"Shut up!" a third hissed. "Stick to the plan. One screw-up, and we’re done."

"Oh, relax. They’re so obsessed with Evelyn, they won’t notice a thing," the second girl scoffed.

A sharp slap echoed off the walls. "Enough! Let’s go before someone hears!"

Shit. I hurried to finish up, but the door slammed shut before I could react.

"Grayson!" I yelled through the link. "Stop those girls—now!"

###Chapter 0385

"What?" Grayson asked, his attention momentarily diverted.

By the time he focused on me, I had already adjusted my underwear and was halfway to the door. "The girls..." My eyes darted around the room, searching for any sign of them.

"What's happening?" Grayson's grip tightened on my arm as he pulled me aside.

"Three girls were in there. They mentioned some plan being set in motion and their role in it," I whispered urgently, my gaze still scanning the crowded space.

"Do you recognize them?" Grayson straightened up, his protective arm remaining around me as he surveyed the room.

"Not at all."

"Alright, let's return to our table." Grayson's arm fully encircled me as he guided us back.

"Audrey, we're planning a girls' night. You in?" Evelyn stood waiting by our table as we approached.

"Absolutely! That sounds perfect. When were you thinking?"

"Not sure yet, but I'll keep you posted. Things are hectic these next few weeks, but maybe a school night?" Sebastian appeared beside Evelyn with a drink, his free hand resting on her barely visible baby bump – so much smaller than mine.

"Oh, a school night..." I gave her a mischievous grin as I sipped my lemonade.

"I live for danger," Evelyn laughed, her eyes sparkling.

"We could host it at my place," I offered. "What will the guys be doing?"

"I believe they're planning a hunting trip," Evelyn said with a meaningful look that clearly indicated their prey wasn't animal.

"Interesting," was all I managed to say.

"Grayson. We need to discuss Audrey's Luna ceremony with Alpha Gregory," Sebastian stated.

"Right, I'm coming." Grayson exchanged a glance with Nathan, who subtly repositioned himself. The men's demeanor shifted as they walked away.

"I should make my rounds. Back soon," Evelyn said before disappearing into the crowd.

"Sorry, Audrey, I need to pump. We'll return shortly," Sophia said as she and Oliver exited through a different door. My eyes followed her movement but caught three girls huddled together. Their conspiratorial posture sent a jolt of recognition through me. As the door began closing, they started down the hallway.

"Where are you going?" Nathan did a double take as I stood and moved swiftly toward the door.

"Taking a walk," I replied without looking back.

"You shouldn't—"

"Shh!" I pressed a finger to my lips, silencing him. Once in the hallway, I grabbed his arm and pulled him along.

"What's going on?" His whisper tickled my ear as we followed the path the girls had taken.

"Three girls in the bathroom were talking about some plan. I want to know what they're plotting," I explained, slipping off my shoes to move more quietly.

"We should return and let Grayson handle this," Nathan urged.

"If you're scared, you can leave," I shot back, feeling an unexpected thrill of adventure.

"It's not me I'm worried about." Nathan's gaze darted down the hall. Handing him my shoes, I pressed forward, feeling more secure as the hallway began sloping upward.

"Do you hear them?" I whispered.

"Maybe..." Nathan kept glancing back, his discomfort palpable. My curiosity burned brighter.

"Don't screw this up, Rosalie!" a girl's sharp voice carried down the hall.

"I won't!" came the exasperated reply.

"Run through the plan again," a second voice demanded.

"Audrey won't be dancing, so I'll ask Grayson. During our dance, you'll create a distraction so I can inject him with the poison."

"Good. And you?"

"I'll be near Audrey. When chaos breaks out, I'll sedate her so our men can take her."

Nathan's hand clamped over my mouth, muffling my gasp. Pinned against the wall, panic surged through me. "I'll alert Grayson. Stay still," Nathan breathed so quietly I almost doubted I'd heard it.

"Perfect. Here are your syringes. Don't accidentally dose yourselves."

"This is so exciting!" Footsteps grew louder, echoing down the corridor.

Without a word, Nathan scooped me up and hurried down the hall. Thankful for my bare feet, I barely had time to react before being shoved against another wall. "Don't move," Nathan commanded in a tone that sent shivers down my spine. His iron grip on my arms promised bruises by morning. Moments later, shouts and scuffles erupted nearby.

Words failed me as I struggled to see, held firmly in place. A loud crash to our left was followed by Nathan shoving me right as he engaged in a brutal fistfight. It lasted mere seconds, but the metallic scent of blood filled the air.

###Chapter 0386

"Audrey!" Grayson's voice cut through the chaos, but my gaze remained locked on the lifeless body sprawled across the floor. "Look at me!"

Electric sparks danced across my skin as Grayson seized my shoulders, forcing me to meet his eyes. "W-what?"

"Are you hurt?"

I blinked, struggling to pull myself together. "Yeah. I just... I've never seen someone die like that before. I've seen bodies, sure, but never watched it happen."

"Is she in shock?" Sebastian's voice was sharp with concern.

"Audrey?" Grayson cupped my face, deliberately blocking my view of the corpse.

My lips parted, but no words came out.

"It's okay," Grayson murmured before barking, "NATHAN!"

"Right here."

"What the hell happened?" Sebastian demanded.

"Sophia stepped out to pump, and Audrey said she saw some women in the hallway. She chased after them, and we couldn’t stop her. That’s when we overheard them planning to kill you with poison and knock Audrey out to finish her off."

"Did you catch them?" I asked, glancing between them. Three sets of eyes flickered down at me.

"We did. They’re being transferred to my cells," Sebastian said.

"Was there a scene?"

"Minor, but we kept it contained," Nathan answered, exchanging glances with Grayson and Sebastian.

"Good. Sebastian, this ceremony is for you too. We can’t let anyone suspect anything. Nathan can take me back to our table. Sebastian, act like nothing happened. Grayson can join us once this is handled."

Grayson and Sebastian shared a silent agreement before nodding. "Fine. But are you sure you're okay?" Grayson’s hand settled on my shoulder, his grip firm.

"I’m not a child," I snapped, irritation flaring as I shrugged him off and turned toward the party.

"I’ve got her," Nathan said, catching up to me in quick strides. My emotions were a tangled mess—anger, confusion, frustration. Logically, I knew Grayson wasn’t patronizing me, so why was I so furious? Was this the pregnancy hormones? It would explain Sophia’s mood swings too.

Thankfully, our table was empty when we returned. "Audrey, seriously, are you okay?" Nathan whispered as I sank into my seat. He took Grayson’s chair, arms bracketing me in a way that might’ve looked intimate to outsiders.

"I think so." I grabbed my lemonade, wishing it were something stronger as I gulped it down.

"Do you need a doctor? Is the baby all right?" Nathan pressed.

"Nathan, I just need a minute." I dropped my elbows onto the table, resting my forehead against my hands.

His grip suddenly tightened on my arm, twisting it. I followed his gaze and saw the bruises forming.

"That was fast," I muttered, pulling away.

"Who did this?" His voice was dangerously low.

"The guard you handed me to. Probably have matching ones on the other arm. Not a big deal—they did save my life."

"Audrey! Are you okay?" Evelyn rushed over, barely sparing Nathan a glance as she took the seat beside me.

"I’m fine. Just... processing."

"Do you need anything?" Her urgency made my head throb.

"I don’t even know. Maybe just to rest."

"You’re pale," she observed, worry etching her features.

"Actually, I feel dizzy—" The glass slipped from my fingers, shattering against the table. Nathan caught most of the spill, but Evelyn lunged forward as my vision swam.

"We need to get her to a hospital now," Evelyn ordered. "Carry her to my car."

The world tilted as Nathan scooped me up, my head lolling against his chest. "I already mind-linked Grayson, but we’re not waiting," he told Evelyn. Black spots crowded my vision, swallowing my surroundings.

"Audrey! Stay with me!" Evelyn’s shout barely registered as something slammed—a car door? The ground lurked beneath me, the world spinning violently.

The next thing I knew, blinding lights and shrill beeps assaulted my senses. Hands shoved and pulled at me, voices shouting my name, sharp pinches on my arm. I heard them, but I couldn’t respond.

Then—fabric tearing. A single coherent thought surfaced: My dress. The delicate material was sliced open, cold gel smearing over my stomach before one word cut through the noise.

"Healthy."

Relief crashed over me, and I surrendered to the darkness.

###Chapter 0387

My head throbbed as consciousness slowly returned. Tiny electric currents danced along my skin, alerting me to Grayson's presence beside me.

"Audrey!" A shrill voice pierced through the fog in my mind.

"Grayson?" I croaked, my throat dry.

"Right here, love." His voice was rough with worry.

"What happened?" I tried prying my eyes open, but the relentless beeping of a nearby machine grated on my nerves.

"I'll get the doctor!" The high-pitched voice declared before footsteps hurried away. I didn’t catch who it was—my vision was still too blurry. Instead, Grayson’s anxious face filled my line of sight.

"You collapsed. The doctors ran tests. I thought—" His voice cracked. "I thought they might have poisoned you. I’ve been out of my mind." His eyes shimmered before he pressed his forehead against my hand. I reached for him, the IV tugging at my skin, but I ignored it, threading my fingers through his hair.

"I’m sorry for scaring you. What did the doctor say? Is the baby okay?"

"They haven’t told me anything yet." Grayson lifted his head, his jaw tight with barely restrained frustration.

"They’re probably running bloodwork. Let them do their job."

The door swung open, and Evelyn strode in. "The doctor’s on his way. How are you feeling?" Her eyes were red-rimmed, like she’d been crying.

"I’m fine. I’m so sorry for ruining your party."

"Your life—and that baby’s—are more important than any celebration," Evelyn said firmly, perching on the edge of my bed. They must have been camped here the whole time.

"What happened? At the party?" I glanced between them.

"The girls were caught. Their men tried to retaliate, but we were prepared. Took them down fast. Honestly, most guests didn’t even realize anything happened," Evelyn said with a shrug.

"I hear our patient is awake." A tall, wiry man entered, his salt-and-pepper hair and deep wrinkles speaking of decades of experience.

"Is she all right?" Grayson demanded, rising to his feet.

"She’s perfectly fine. No toxins, no abnormalities. All her levels are normal."

"Then why did she faint?" Grayson pressed.

"Pregnancy hormones increase heart rate and blood flow. Blood vessels dilate, which can cause fainting. Combine that with the shock of witnessing a death, and her body simply shut down. For now, I don’t see cause for concern, but fainting during pregnancy can sometimes indicate something more serious. Watch for dizziness or excessive bleeding, but I’m not classifying her as high-risk yet. Just take it easy—no overexertion."

"That’s a relief," I murmured, more to myself than anyone else.

"What about the baby?" Grayson wasn’t letting this go.

"Well, do you want to know everything I found?" The doctor moved to a monitor and switched it on.

"Yes." Grayson’s voice was tight with controlled anger. The doctor ignored his tone.

"This is the sonogram we took when Luna Audrey was admitted."

"Holy hell!" Evelyn’s eyes widened as she stared at the screen.

"What?" I looked between her and the grainy image.

"Triplets," the doctor said simply. "This is Baby A, Baby B, and this little one is Baby C. Three separate sacs, each with their own placenta."

Silence swallowed the room. I gaped at the monitor, my brain struggling to process it.

"What?" Grayson finally choked out.

"Triplets. You’re far enough along that we can see them clearly, but with both of you being alphas and carrying three, predicting your due date is tricky. I’d like you back in a week or two for an anatomy scan to track their growth. Oh, and we have the genders from the bloodwork—if you’d like to know?" He glanced between us.

###Chapter 0388

"Do we?" Grayson's voice trembled with disbelief.

My lips parted but no words escaped. The ultrasound screen held me captive. "Here." The doctor switched off the monitor and handed us printed images. "These are your sonograms. The envelope contains your babies' genders. Open it when you're ready - if you want to know. Luna Audrey can be discharged, but I'm placing her on light duty. Fainting during pregnancy isn't unusual, but it can indicate complications. Call me anytime."

Grayson accepted the envelope but remained frozen. Sebastian didn't move either - I wasn't even blinking, and Grayson might as well have been carved from stone. Only when the door creaked open did I tear my gaze from the images.

"Is everything alright?" Sebastian's concerned voice cut through the silence as he approached Evelyn.

"Y-yes! We're fine. Audrey's fine. We should... um... give them privacy." Evelyn sprang up, grabbing Sebastian's wrist to drag him out.

"Triplets..." Grayson collapsed into the chair like his legs had given out.

"That's what the scans show..." My fingers traced each image, studying every tiny limb and profile.

"I've got three babies growing inside you." His warm palm settled on my belly as he rested his forehead against me.

"No wonder I've been feeling like a beached whale." I set down the images to meet his gaze.



"You're breathtaking." His smile softened the worry lines on his forehead.

"Want to know the genders?" I plucked the envelope from his stiff fingers.

"Whatever you prefer." His voice was thick with emotion.

"That's not what I asked." My exasperated smile held equal parts annoyance and affection.

"I mean it. If you want the surprise, we'll wait. Your call." He finally lifted his head, eyes shining.

"I think... I want to know." My voice wavered slightly.

"Okay." He shifted so we could both see the paper.

My trembling fingers unfolded the tri-folded sheet. Bold letters proclaimed: RESULTS. Below, three distinct lines waited.

"Boy!" I jabbed at the first line's bold declaration.

"Two boys!" Grayson's excitement bubbled over as he indicated the next.

"Girl!" We gasped simultaneously at the third revelation.

"Two princes and a princess!" Grayson leaped up, the paper fluttering in his grip, his grin splitting his face.

"Guess my nursery shopping list just tripled." I laughed weakly.

"You've already been shopping?" His gaze melted me with its tenderness.

"A little."



"I adore you." He crushed his lips to mine in a searing kiss.

"Take me home?" I murmured against his mouth.

"Absolutely." He peeled back the hospital sheets, carefully helping me stand.

"My dress - they cut it off, didn't they?" I sighed at the loss.

"Emergency protocol. Evelyn brought you sweats and a tee." He produced the standard werewolf emergency kit from his trunk - black joggers and a vintage Rolling Stones shirt.

"I can fetch a wheelchair." He hovered as we exited.

"Doctor said light duty, not bedrest." Rolling my eyes, I marched toward the exit.

"But you should-"

"No!" My sharp whisper drew glances from nearby staff. "Not here."

Grayson's puzzled frown deepened but he didn't argue. Only when we were safely in the car did he speak.

"What was that about?"

"I don't want the triplets news spreading yet. Let's announce it properly at my Luna ceremony."

###Chapter 0389

"Should we tell everyone at once?"

"Absolutely. One grand announcement. Can you message Evelyn and ask her to keep it quiet for now?" I requested.

"Of course." Grayson pulled out his phone and sent her a quick text as we drove home. The ultrasound photos were clutched tightly in my hand.

"Good thing we have that extra bedroom," I mused as he set his phone down.

"Definitely."

"At least I won’t have to go through pregnancy again after this."

"What do you mean?" Grayson glanced at me. "You only want three kids?"

"I don’t need to risk ending up with six. Plus, three at once is going to be chaos."

"Maybe, but I have faith we’ll handle it like pros." He flashed me a confident grin.

"I’ll remind you of that when we’re both sleep-deprived, covered in baby vomit, and haven’t showered in weeks."

"That’s a bit dramatic, don’t you think?" He rolled his eyes.

"Nope. Just the right amount of realism."

"Anyway, you’ll need to hire a couple of assistants since you’ll be working from home now." He gave me a look that dared me to argue.

"Fine. It’s not like we haven’t already cleared out the office anyway." I folded my arms, and his gaze flickered downward.

"If you need anything, just ask me or have someone else get it for you."

"I can set up a workspace in the living room. We have that folding table I can use." I hadn’t planned on being homebound so soon, but here we were.

"Go ahead and order whatever we need for the babies. I guess we’ll need three of everything." He grimaced, realizing the financial toll.

"Now that it’s real, I have to focus on practicality, not just what looks cute. It’s harder now that it’s actually happening."

"You’ll do great." Grayson squeezed my hand as we pulled into the driveway. "I’ll get you settled, then I have to head out. We’re questioning the girls this afternoon—Sebastian’s just waiting on me. Unless you need me here?"

"No, I’ll be fine."

"I’m not leaving you alone. Evelyn’s already inside." He helped me out of the car.

"She can help me pick out a few things." I was relieved she was here.

"Audrey! How are you feeling?" Evelyn looked up from her phone as we walked in.

"Good, just exhausted."

"I set up the recliner for you." She moved the pillow and blanket aside. Once I sat down, she draped the blanket over me and adjusted the pillow behind my head.

"I appreciate the pampering, but I’m still capable of doing things myself."

"Nonsense." She waved me off.

"You’re pregnant too," I reminded her.

"Not with triplets!"

"I’ll leave you two to it. There’ll be a guard outside. Need anything else?" Grayson asked.

"I don’t think so. I must’ve been out cold all night—the sun’s already up."

"Yeah…" He frowned. "Try to rest. I’ll bring breakfast when I come back."

"Thanks, bro! Breakfast burrito, please!" Evelyn called as she flopped onto the couch.

"I’ll see what I can do." He rolled his eyes before turning to me. "What do you want?"

"Biscuits and sausage gravy."

"Got it." With that, he left.

###Chapter 0390
Grayson POV

"You escaped faster than I anticipated." Sebastian remarked dryly as I stepped into his office.

"Audrey was discharged first thing this morning after waking up. Scarlett is with her at home while she rests." I dropped into the chair across from him, but Sebastian barely glanced up from his paperwork.

"Glad she's recovering." A heavy silence stretched between us before he finally looked up, smirking. "Surprised you're not passed out somewhere. Triplets will wreck you."

I shot him a glare. He snorted and returned to his files. Leaning back, my mind raced—bottles, diapers, tiny clothes. So many tiny clothes.

"Triplets aren’t the end of the world," I muttered, more to myself than him.

"How far along is she?"

"The doctor wasn’t certain. Two alphas mean the pregnancy moves faster. We’ve got another scan scheduled." My gaze snagged on the whiskey bottle in the corner. Without thinking, I grabbed it and took a swig, the burn steadying my nerves.

"Bit early for that?" Sebastian set down his pen and stood.

"May as well get used to sleepless nights now."

"You’ll adjust once the shock wears off." He clapped a hand on my shoulder.

"I’m equal parts thrilled and terrified. I wanted a baby. One. Not three. Just… processing." I exhaled sharply. "I’ll be fine. Just need a minute."



"Do you know the genders?"

"I do, but Audrey wants to keep it secret—even the triplet part. She’s planning to announce everything at her Luna ceremony."

"I’ll bring the whiskey," Sebastian deadpanned as we headed toward the cells.

"How far along is Scarlett?"

"Twelve weeks."

"Four kids between us. If yours look like Scarlett and mine look like me, they’ll pass as siblings, not cousins."

"Let’s just interrogate these women and get lunch," Sebastian muttered, rolling his eyes.

"They requested breakfast."

"Let me guess—Evelyn demanded a breakfast burrito?"

"Spot on."

"Sausage only. No bacon."

"No bacon?" I frowned.

"Turns her stomach. Learned that the hard way."

The stench of the cells hit me like a wall. No matter how often I came here, the reek of sweat and fear never failed to twist my gut. But I’d never let it show. Sebastian opened the viewing room door.

"What’s the plan?" He crossed his arms, studying the three women through the glass.

I mirrored his stance, jaw tight. One moment, I’d been discussing border patrol with Alpha Gregory. The next, Nathan’s panicked mind-link: Audrey’s in danger. A few seconds later, and she—and our unborn triplets—could’ve been…

"Beating them senseless won’t work. They’re women."

"Find the weakest link. Focus on her." Sebastian’s gaze flicked between them, assessing.

"Start with their nails. Women care more about scars and appearances." Their restrained hands made it easy.

"Pliers are on the table. Your show." Sebastian nodded at me.

I shoved thoughts of Audrey aside, letting cold fury flood my veins. My wolf snarled, craving vengeance. "Morning, ladies," I drawled, stepping inside. My eyes darkened to pitch—no point hiding it. My wolf wanted blood.

"Go to hell," the middle one spat, venom dripping. She didn’t flinch as I loomed over them. The left one kept darting glances between Sebastian and me. The right stared at the ceiling like it held answers.

"Pathetic attempt on Luna Audrey’s life," I said.

###Chapter 0391

"Don't forget yours," Sebastian murmured in my ear.

I smirked. "Ah yes, didn't even graze me." Watching their reactions carefully, I saw the middle girl roll her eyes dramatically while leaning back in her chair. The one on the left snorted in derision, while the right kept her gaze stubbornly fixed on the ceiling.

"Some might argue you weren't truly committed," I observed. "Almost as if you wanted to fail. Discussing plans in a public restroom? That's beyond reckless - it's amateurish."

"I told you to shut your damn mouth!" The girl on the right whipped her head around, her glare burning with unexpected intensity. What surprised me most wasn't the anger, but how her voice remained at that same dangerous pitch - low, controlled, and vibrating with fury.

The leftmost girl flinched visibly. Found our weakest link. "I don't answer to you anymore!" The middle one declared, though her voice wavered slightly.

I inhaled deeply. "You three are rogues?" The scent was unmistakable - that faint rot of newly turned rogues. They hadn't been outcasts for long.

"Why do you care? Just finish us and be done with it," the middle girl challenged, though the tremor in her voice betrayed her bravado.

"Tell me what I need to know," I said calmly, "and I'll make it quick."

She sneered. "Go to hell."

"Very well." Moving to the table, I deliberately picked up the pliers, turning them over in my hands with theatrical slowness.

"What are you planning to do with those?" The middle girl's eyes tracked my movements like I was handling a live grenade.



I approached her slowly, bending until we were eye level. Gripping one of her fingers, I extended it and positioned the pliers around her nail. "Final chance."

Her eyes darted between me and the tool. "I've got nothing to say!" The false courage in her voice was almost pitiful.

Without ceremony, I squeezed and pulled in one fluid motion. The nail came away cleanly.

"GODDAMN IT!" Blood immediately welled up, dripping steadily onto the concrete floor.

"Quit your whining. That's nothing," the right girl scoffed. Sebastian chose that moment to step forward, knife in hand, carving a deep 'S' into her cheek.

"There," he said coolly. "Now you're permanently marked with the Silvercrest crest."

"You bastard!" she shrieked. "You have no idea what you've just done!"

While she was distracted, I moved to the middle girl's next finger. Another quick motion, another nail removed.

"FUCK!" Her entire body convulsed against the restraints.

"We had no choice!" The left girl suddenly blurted out.

"Keep talking," I encouraged.

"Shut your trap!" the right one snapped.

Sebastian tapped the knife against the left girl's cheekbone. "Next one takes your eye." She swallowed hard but fell silent.

"You were saying?" I prompted.

"We...we belonged to Alpha Damian's pack," the left girl whispered. "After he died, our mates took us and ran. Now we serve Lorenzo."

There it was. Lorenzo. The name sent fire through my veins. "He sent three females to do his dirty work?" I kept my voice deliberately unimpressed.

"We're not useless," the middle girl spat, then seemed to reconsider her tone. "I'll give you whatever you want to let me live."

"Whatever I want?" I feigned confusion.

"Sexually," she clarified, her breathing uneven.

"Your mates actually agreed to this?" I couldn't hide my disgust. "They'd have you whore yourselves out as some kind of...distress signal?"

"Yes. Once we...perform, they'll feel it through the bond and come for us."

I actually took a step back, needing physical distance from this insanity. "Let me understand this. Your brilliant plan is to get captured, sleep with your captors, which somehow alerts your mates through the bond, who will then attempt a rescue?"

"That's right."

"You honestly believe," I said slowly, "that men who sent their mates into danger would actually come save you after you've been with another man?"

###Chapter 0392

"They adore us." Her expression crumbled.

"Wake up. We were doomed the second they sent us to that gathering." The blood-streaked girl spat.

"My mate truly loves me!" She sobbed.

"If he did, you wouldn't be in this situation. Our only hope was succeeding and gaining Lorenzo's favor. Now we'll die here, and he'll execute our mates for failing." She stated coldly, resignation in her voice.

"I don't want to die!" The middle girl's tears streamed down her cheeks.

"Tell us what we need to know, and I'll let you live." I crouched before her, adopting a paternal gaze. Women broke differently than men. Well, most women.

"You'll get nothing from us!"

Sebastian pressed the blade against her other cheek, carving an 'M'. She jerked violently, resulting in her ear being severed. "Should've stayed still." Crimson painted half her face.

"I-I can't!" Her terrified eyes darted to her companion.

"Goo-" Sebastian's knife flashed across her throat. A crimson fountain drenched his lower body. Within seconds, her attempts to speak failed as her eyes glazed over.

"S-she's gone!" The middle girl stared in horror at her lifeless friend.

"I'll make it quick if you cooperate." My voice remained steady.

"Lorenzo promised rewards for capturing Audrey. He provided the poison and instructions." Her tears almost evoked pity. Almost.

"Where's his base?"

"I don't know! He met us at our tent in the refugee camp. This was our first mission. Our mates had done several, but he said women could get closer to Audrey unnoticed."

"What else is planned?"

"Nothing! I swear! We were only told to drug Audrey, kill you, then deliver her to the drop point. Our backup team was supposed to attack when we signaled... but you eliminated them." Desperation filled her pleading eyes.

"She's truthful. We know nothing." The leftmost girl whimpered. Sebastian approached and methodically opened her throat. For sixty agonizing seconds, she silently begged us while drowning in her own blood.

"Final opportunity. Anything else?" I pressed. The surviving girl kept her eyes screwed shut, but couldn't block out the gurgling sounds.

"FUCK! There's a midnight meeting in the forest tonight! I don't know the exact location, just that it's happening!"

Applying pliers to another fingernail, I intensified the pressure. "Absolutely certain?"

###Chapter 0393

"Are you two comfortable staying here?" I asked while tightening the laces on my combat boots.

Audrey crossed her arms. "What's your plan exactly? Wander through the woods hoping to stumble upon this secret meeting?"

Scarlett frowned from the couch. "She has a point. Do you even know where it's happening?"

"We have a lead." I hadn't told them about my informant yet. He'd been tailing the targets, giving us precise coordinates. The real challenge would be approaching undetected.

"Oliver and Sophia will be here soon. Just try to relax tonight." I kissed Audrey's forehead before standing to leave.

"Be careful," Scarlett grumbled.

I met her gaze. "You know we have to go."

"I hate being left behind. I want in on the action!"

"You're pregnant. Absolutely not," Sebastian said firmly, kissing her temple.

"Not too pregnant for other activities," she retorted, leaning back with an eye roll.

"Just...come back safe." Audrey's worry pulsed through our bond. No matter how much calm I projected, her anxiety remained.

I crouched before her chair, gripping the armrests. "I promise we'll return whole. Nothing will stop me from meeting our pups. Nathan's at your service tonight."

"Pity you won't be my personal attendant instead." Her fingers traced my jawline.

I whispered against her ear, "I'll make it up to you in bed later."

"Deal." Her smile widened as I straightened.

"Nathan, if she gets so much as a hangnail, I'll break both your arms," I warned while exiting.

"A hangnail?" Sebastian chuckled as we approached my car.

"First threat that came to mind." The engine roared to life as we pulled onto the darkened road.

"How did your source pinpoint the location?" Sebastian asked.

"Didn't question methods."

Sebastian checked the surveillance gear. "Got everything you requested."

"Good. We'll need long-range audio capture. Might have to observe from a distance."

"This should suffice." He tested the equipment before powering it down.

Fifteen silent minutes later, I killed the engine on a dirt path. Black tactical gear rendered us invisible as we melted into the trees. Even our eyes shifted to absorb moonlight. Without Sebastian's heat signature beside me, I wouldn't have detected his presence.

A sudden grip on my arm halted me. Sebastian signaled auditory contact. Adrenaline spiked as we crept leftward.

Whispers crystallized into recognizable voices.

"...flawless execution." That smooth baritone belonged to Xavier.

"Magnus will be thrilled!" The feminine voice turned my blood to ice. It couldn't be...

Sebastian nudged night vision binoculars into my hands. The green-tinted image confirmed my dread.

"Not yet. Let me calibrate this first," Xavier cautioned.

Victoria argued, "I already told him I secured it!" Her fingers clutched a metallic case that glinted ominously in the moonlight.

###Chapter 0394

"I warned you not to do this!" Sebastian's glare was sharp enough to cut steel. "We had an agreement. I thought you wanted to help Magnus. If you hand this over to him, there's no saving him now."

"I have to! He's starting to doubt me!" Victoria's voice cracked, tears streaming down her face. "If I don't help him, he'll leave me! He loves me, but he can't protect me if I keep failing!"

"Stop crying. I don't have patience for weak women." Sebastian's tone was ice-cold. "Don't make an enemy of me. I'm trying to help you." He was manipulating her effortlessly. "Let me make a few quick adjustments before we head to the meeting."

"You know about the meeting?" Victoria gasped, her eyes widening.

"I'm surprised Magnus is even letting you attend." Sebastian barely glanced at her.

"He's introducing me to everyone tonight. I've earned my place now."

"Breaking into Grayson's office was enough to earn their trust?" Sebastian scoffed as he scribbled on the stolen documents.

"I did it once—I can do it again. I didn't have much time to search, but now I know how to get in." Victoria's voice dripped with pride, her ambition burning bright. My stomach twisted as I listened. This wasn't the girl I once knew.

"If this goes well, I'll need to meet Magnus myself. We'll need a solid plan." Sebastian continued altering the papers, barely acknowledging her.

"I don't know... He might refuse. Then he'll realize I've been working with you, and he'll be furious."



"What you need to tell him," Sebastian said smoothly, "is that Grayson and Audrey have moved out of the packhouse. They're staying in a rental now, leaving the office completely unguarded. You'll let Magnus sneak in at night to search it himself. That will prove your loyalty. Once he sees you're all in, he won't hesitate to meet me."

That bastard was going to die. By my hands or my wolf's—it didn't matter. When this was over, he wouldn't be breathing. Shock faded, replaced by white-hot rage. Was Victoria just dating Magnus? Come to think of it, I was pretty sure someone mentioned Magnus already had a mate—or at least someone he was involved with. How did they even meet?

"Are you almost done? The meeting starts soon, and I can't be late. That would ruin everything." Victoria hugged herself, shivering despite the warm night. Her fear was written all over her face.

Part of me wanted to help her—she was still pack. But the other part knew she was committing treason. The mate bond was strong, but she could have come to me for help. She chose this path. She chose wrong.

"Here. It's done. You need to go. I'll follow separately so we aren't seen together."

"Good!" Relief flooded Victoria's voice as she snatched the rolled-up blueprints. Whatever changes Sebastian had made, they couldn't be good.

Victoria stomped into the forest without a care for who might hear. Sebastian waited until she was fifty yards ahead before following, moving like a ghost. Evelyn and I moved parallel to them, keeping our distance. I tracked Victoria and Sebastian while Evelyn watched our surroundings. We didn't know exactly where this meeting was taking place, but we'd find out.

###Chapter 0395

I didn't have to ask Sebastian if he was recording. The equipment was visible, and he moved with the same instincts as me. My life was in his hands, and I knew he'd deliver.

"Magnus!" Victoria's voice rang out, brimming with excitement as she sprinted toward me.

"Quiet!" Magnus hushed her, but his tone was surprisingly tender. "Did you come alone?" He pulled her into an embrace while scanning behind her, as if sensing someone lurking. Xavier stood frozen behind a tree.

"I did—but look what I found!" She stepped back, brandishing what I assumed were the blueprints.

"Perfect." His eyes gleamed as he examined them. "What are these symbols?"

"No clue," she admitted. "I just figured out how to break into his office and grabbed these."

"Raphael will love this," Magnus murmured.

"So, what's next?" Victoria fidgeted nervously.

"We take this to Raphael. He'll scout the area and devise a plan. Since the others failed, Grayson knows we're after Audrey now. No more hiding. It's time for a direct assault."

"Did he really think they'd succeed?" Victoria sounded skeptical.

"What do you mean?"

"Grayson wouldn’t leave her unguarded, and his security isn’t weak." She gave Magnus a look like he was dense. "He sent them on a suicide mission."

"Or they walked right up to him with a plan, and he approved it. Don’t assume Raphael ever believed three girls could pull this off. He knew snatching her and selling her was too easy. This way, Grayson fights back—and that’s what makes it fun for Raphael. He’s a cat toying with prey. Raphael doesn’t care who dies, as long as he wins in the end."

"You think he’ll get Audrey that easily?" Doubt laced her voice.

"Raphael has more in motion than you realize. If you want to stay involved, stop questioning him." Magnus’s warning was sharp.

"I know, I know." She shook her head.

"Questions make him think you’re against him. Meeting him is dangerous enough. If he suspects you’ll run to Grayson, he’ll kill you on the spot."

"I get it. I want to help you. Maybe one day, we’ll be a family." She pressed a hand to his chest. Magnus didn’t react, just stared at her. "I’ll risk my life for you if I have to."

"I shouldn’t even allow this." He leaned down, kissing her before taking her hand. But after a few steps, he let go and kept his distance.

"Wondered where you vanished to." Raphael’s voice cut through the air, freezing Magnus mid-step.

"Spying on me?" Magnus recovered fast, his posture shifting to neutral.

"You brought a guest?"

"Raphael, this is Victoria—Grayson’s ex. She infiltrated his office and got these." Magnus offered the papers, but Raphael’s gaze stayed locked on Victoria.

Slowly, he closed the distance. His fingers traced her hair, then slid down her arms. Magnus’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t intervene. Raphael lifted Victoria’s hand, pressing a kiss to it while staring into her eyes. "What a delight. And you’re Grayson’s ex?"

###Chapter 0396

Victoria trembled visibly, her gaze darting between Raphael and Magnus.

"What exactly do you have to offer me that made Magnus think I wouldn't kill you right here?" Raphael stopped circling her and wrapped his hands around her throat.

"I brought the blueprints. Maybe you can use them to capture Audrey." Her voice was barely audible. If I hadn't been watching her lips, I would have missed it entirely.

"So, you're offering to be my inside informant?" Raphael released her and stepped in front of her. "Why should I trust you? You're committing treason right now. If Grayson found out, he'd execute you on the spot."

"I-I don't want Audrey as my Luna." The lie was obvious in Victoria's shaky tone.

"You expect me to believe you're on my side?" Raphael stared at her without blinking.

"I am." Victoria lifted her chin defiantly.

"Prove it."

"H-how?" she stammered.

Raphael snapped his fingers, and movement rustled behind Victoria. My eyes flicked toward the sound—three men were dragging Xavier toward them, struggling to keep him subdued.

"This man has been a thorn in my side for years. You lied when you said you weren't followed." Raphael's glare shifted between Victoria and Magnus.

"I didn't realize we were." Magnus shifted uncomfortably.



"Of course not. You were too distracted by your little obsession to notice." Raphael strode forward and backhanded Xavier across the face. Magnus didn't argue, but his eyes burned with hatred. "If you want my trust, kill him." Raphael held out a gun to Victoria.

"What?" Her mouth fell open as she stared at the weapon, then at Xavier.

"Grayson?" Sebastian whispered so softly I barely caught it. I met his gaze, my pulse racing. What do we do? Save him?

"Damn it," I muttered back. We weren't prepared for this.

"Take the gun and shoot him." Raphael shoved the weapon into Victoria's hands, forcing her to grip it.

Sebastian stashed our equipment, and we moved into position. This wasn’t going to be a fair fight—our only advantage was the element of surprise.

Victoria's hands shook violently, the gun wobbling in every direction. "Come on, don't let the coward kill me," Xavier groaned.

"Would you prefer I do it?" Raphael asked. "Either way, you won’t see sunrise."

"We can make a deal. You know I'm Audrey's father."

"I don't care if you're the Moon Goddess's father. You've ruined enough of my plans—tonight ends that." Raphael snarled. "Shoot him!"

Victoria tried to steady the gun but dropped it seconds later. "I can't!" she sobbed.

"It wasn’t even loaded." Magnus glared at her.

Sebastian and I were nearly in position when Raphael picked up the gun.



"Guess you're not as loyal as you claimed." He pulled a clip from his pocket and loaded the weapon.

Drawing my knife, I exchanged a final nod with Sebastian before we lunged into action. He took down the three men holding Xavier while I went straight for Raphael. I had one shot before chaos erupted.

Raphael spotted me at the last second and twisted. The gun fired as I leaped, the bullet grazing my cheek. My blade slashed downward, sending us tumbling. We both scrambled up—the gun lay between us. Magnus had seized Victoria, restraining her.

"Well, well. What a pleasant surprise. The man I’ve been dying to kill." Blood trickled down my cheek, but Raphael's arm was bleeding too.

"Looks like you're the one in danger now," I taunted. Sebastian finished off the last guard and knocked Xavier unconscious with a punch.

###Chapter 0397

"Here to rescue the girl? I'm shocked. Didn't think you'd give a damn about her."

"I don't. Keep her. If I ever see her back on my territory, she's dead. Just like you said." My grip tightened on the knife as I pointed it at Xavier. "But this piece of trash? I want to kill him myself."

"Nothing to do with him being Audrey's father?" Raphael taunted, his smirk widening. He was stalling—I could hear the pounding footsteps closing in.

"You might wanna get that arm checked, Raphael."

Magnus lunged for the gun, and that was my cue. Sebastian already had Xavier slung over his shoulder. We bolted, not caring about the noise. Gunfire erupted behind us, splintering tree bark as bullets whizzed past. Either Magnus was a terrible shot, or he wasn’t aiming to kill.

It sounded like an entire damn army chasing us. Shouts, more gunfire—chaos. "F*ck! If we die for this worthless bastard—!" I snarled. The car came into view.

I yanked the back door open for Sebastian, then slid into the driver’s seat, firing up the engine. Dozens of men were sprinting toward us now, bullets peppering the windshield. I waited for Sebastian’s signal.

"You in?" I glanced back.

"GO! GO! GO!" he growled, pain lacing his voice.

I slammed the gas, tires spinning, dirt flying. "You hit?"

"Through and through," Sebastian bit out. "Motherf*cker—this never gets easier."

I checked the rearview as the figures shrank into the distance. "F*cking Victoria!" I grabbed my phone, dialing Nathan. He answered on the first ring.

"Fast work," he said.

"Meet me at the damn hospital. Leave the girls at home with a warrior. You and Oliver—get your asses there now." I hung up before he could respond.

"That was your ex… the one from the pizza place when I first met Evelyn," Sebastian muttered, voice strained.

"Where’d they get you?"

"Shoulder. I’ll live. Nothing vital—just like last time. F*CK! I hate getting shot!" He punched the door, metal screeching as it dented under his fist.

I mind-linked my warriors. "WARRIORS! OPEN THE GATES—COMING IN HOT. FOUR WARRIORS TO THE HOSPITAL FOR PRISONER TRANSFER!"

The gates swung open just in time. I barely squeezed through, adrenaline burning through me. Sebastian needed a doctor—now.

"Stay with me," I barked.

"I’m good, brother," he gritted out, pissed but steady.

Warriors scrambled into position as we roared through the compound. They knew the drill—no orders needed. If there was trouble, they moved.

The hospital came into view, two medical teams waiting. Ten warriors stood ready. I killed the engine.

"Gunshot wound—shoulder, clean through!" I shouted as the first team rushed over. Sebastian didn’t argue, just hauled himself onto the gurney.

At the same time, Nathan’s car skidded around the corner, tires screeching.

"Warriors—chain this bastard to the wall." I grabbed Xavier’s leg and yanked him out of the car. He hit the pavement hard, but my men hauled him up, dragging him toward the cells.

"SEBASTIAN!" Evelyn’s scream cut through the chaos.

"Alpha! You're bleeding!" Nurses tugged at my clothes.

"Sorry, Alpha—we couldn’t stop her—" Nathan and Oliver struggled to hold the women back.

"ENOUGH!" My roar froze everyone in place.

"Grayson?"

Only Audrey’s voice reached me through the pounding in my skull. Our eyes locked, but fury still burned in my veins.

"You're hurt," she whispered, stepping closer.

I didn’t answer. Not yet.

###Chapter 0398

"It's just a scratch," I muttered, struggling to keep my anger in check. My vision was still clouded with darkness. "I know who did this," I said, leaving the sentence unfinished.

Audrey's hands flew to her hips, her expression shocked. "Who?" she demanded, already understanding my implication.

"Victoria."

Audrey's eyes widened as she took a step back. "No!"

"What about Victoria?" Scarlett pushed past Oliver and stormed toward me. "Are you okay?"

"Warriors!" I barked, ignoring the women. "Get to your stations. I don’t think an attack is imminent, but we need to be prepared regardless. Switch to Delta rotation!"

"Yes, Alpha!" The senior warriors immediately began assigning positions as I turned and strode inside.

"Luna, he's bleeding," a nurse whispered.

"Where is Sebastian?" Scarlett's voice was sharp, her wolf beginning to surface. That couldn’t happen right now. Following his scent, I marched down the hall and threw open the door to an operating room. The medical staff inside jumped at the sudden intrusion.

"Alpha!" the doctor exclaimed as I crossed my arms, daring anyone to challenge me.

"SEBASTIAN!" Scarlett rushed past me and ran to his side.

"I'm fine," Sebastian said, his voice steady. "This is nothing compared to the last time I got shot."

"That’s not funny," Scarlett snapped, tears glistening in her eyes as she gripped his hand.

"It was a little funny," Sebastian teased, trying to lighten the mood. Her wolf slowly retreated.

"The wound isn’t deep, but we need to cauterize and stitch it," the doctor said.

"I’m not going under," Sebastian stated firmly.

"I would recommend—" the doctor began.

"Numb it well and get to work," Sebastian cut in, his tone leaving no room for argument. "I won’t be unconscious, especially if we’re attacked and I can’t fight."

"Yes, Alpha," the doctor conceded.

Soft hands tugged me out of the room.

"Grayson, let them stitch up your face," Audrey said, pulling me into another room and pushing me onto the bed. "What happened?" she asked as the nurses began cleaning the wound.

"She’s Magnus’s mate. She must have been the girl in the pink wing."

"How would—" Audrey started pacing, her mind racing.

"Audrey, sit down," I ordered, watching her rub her belly.

She ignored me. "Is that why she asked for a more hands-on role at my clinics? To get familiar with the layout?"

"Audrey!" I snapped, making her jump.

"What?" She glared at me like I was an idiot. Even the nurses flinched.

"Sit. Down," I commanded, pointing at the chair. She rolled her eyes but obeyed. By then, the nurse was stitching my cheek.

"This looks partially cauterized," she murmured to herself.

"That’s because it was made by a bullet."

"A bullet?" Audrey shot up, examining my wound more closely.

"I can’t wait to kill Lorenzo," I growled.

"Alpha! Someone’s approaching the gate!" a warrior mind-linked me.

"Someone’s at the gate—get this done!" I barked.

"Grayson, what if it’s Victoria?" Audrey looked terrified.

"Done!" the nurse announced.

"Stay here," I told Audrey as I leapt off the bed.

"Grayson!" she shouted.

"Warrior!" I grabbed the nearest man by his shirt and yanked him toward me. "Keep her here and safe, or it’ll be your head."

"Yes, Alpha," he nodded.

"Be careful!" Audrey called after me.

I turned and gave her a look. "Love you," I said before storming out of the hospital.

"Nathan! Front gate!" I mind-linked.

I jumped into my car as Nathan sprinted out of the hospital. "What’s going on?" he asked as I peeled out before he’d even fully closed the door.

"Someone’s at the gates."

"What happened, man?" Nathan pressed as I floored the accelerator.

###Chapter 0399

We approached just in time to see Grayson deep in conversation with Victoria. She was the one who'd attempted to break into my office. The security footage had only captured a figure with pink hair. As Magnus's mate, she'd been aiding them.

"Holy hell."

"Xavier got caught in the crossfire and we had to extract him. This entire situation is completely screwed up beyond belief." My voice was tight as our vehicle rolled up to the gates. My security team had their weapons drawn, barrels aimed beyond our territory.

"Alpha, targets are in our sights," one of my warriors announced as we stepped out.

"Grayson...please!" Victoria's face was streaked with black tear tracks. Magnus knelt nearby, a fresh bullet wound in his side, hands clasped behind his head. Though pale from blood loss, it appeared to be a superficial injury.

"That's Alpha to you," I stated coldly as I moved forward.

"Please, he's bleeding out! Magnus was shot - he's dying! I love him, you have to help!" Victoria pleaded desperately. Magnus shot her an exasperated look.

"It's just a flesh wound."

"Explain why you're here. I should execute you both where you stand." My patience had evaporated.

"A-alpha?" Victoria recoiled at my tone.

"Did you honestly believe I wouldn't notice you sneaking into my office? Shall we search your quarters for a pink wig?"

Victoria looked stunned. "You knew?"

"Obviously. Between security cameras and your little notes, you weren't exactly subtle."

"You warned him?" Magnus glared at Victoria with betrayal in his eyes.

"I did it for you! You never wanted this life! I had to find a way to get you out! Yes, I broke in to steal documents, but I left that note because I didn't want Audrey harmed. I thought if I tipped you off, you'd increase her security. I still delivered falsified intel to Raphael so he'd think I was loyal. That way I could keep warning you, Alpha. Then I encountered Xavier. He offered to help - altered the stolen files so Raphael would receive incorrect information. I didn't even understand what I took - just that it involved Audrey's properties. I asked Audrey for employment to help protect people. All I wanted was to save Magnus and our pack." By the end, Victoria's voice had dwindled to a whisper between sobs.

"You're confessing to treason. You willingly supplied intelligence to someone actively trying to murder your Luna."

I turned to Magnus. "As for you - your crimes warrant execution a dozen times over. Yet you kneel before me begging...for what exactly?"

"A fair hearing. Let me confess everything before you pass judgment. I didn't come willingly, but I had to choose - the mate bond or Raphael."

"You expect me to believe you had a sudden change of heart in mere minutes? During complete chaos, you want me to accept you've switched sides?"

"I haven't switched sides. I'm on whatever side keeps me breathing," Magnus admitted bluntly.

At least he was honest. "You'll receive medical treatment, then be transferred to holding cells for interrogation."

"What?" Victoria's eyes widened in horror. "You can't! He's a good man!"

"He's committed atrocities!" I roared. "How many women did he violate before you? How many children has he abused?" My fury made her shrink back. Magnus offered no resistance as guards hauled him away.

###Chapter 0400

"P-please don't execute him. That would destroy me too." Victoria's voice trembled as her tear-stained face looked up at me. Her sobs had subsided but the raw pain remained.

"How exactly did you meet Magnus?" I demanded, my voice carrying across the courtyard. Nathan stood beside me, his muscular frame radiating the same fury I felt coursing through my veins.

"After...after you mated with Audrey..." Victoria swallowed hard, her fingers twisting together nervously. "I went to drown my sorrows at Moonhowl. My heart was shattered into pieces while you barely glanced my way. Tossed aside like yesterday's garbage. So I drank. Danced. And then...the mate bond hit us like a freight train. We didn't even speak until after the marking. Neither of us expected this. Now we're trapped in this impossible situation."

Her gaze remained fixed on the ground, shame radiating from her slumped shoulders. The once fierce warrior now looked broken beyond recognition.

"You could have come to me," I said through gritted teeth. "One honest conversation could have prevented all this. You risked everything - your life, your mate's life - for what?"

Victoria's head snapped up, sudden anger flashing in her red-rimmed eyes. "Oh sure, let me just stroll up to my ex who discarded me without a second thought. 'Hey Grayson, got drunk, lost my virginity, and accidentally mated with our enemy!' That would have gone over well."

"That's exactly what you should have done!" My voice echoed off the stone walls. "We both knew the risks when we started dating. I warned you weeks before that if we weren't mates, we'd have to end it. That hurt me too, but Audrey is my destined mate. My everything."

The courtyard fell silent except for Victoria's shaky breathing. After a long moment, she whispered, "What will you do with me?"

"You'll be held in the cells until questioning is complete. Then I'll decide your fate."

No protest came as the guards escorted her away. Nathan and I stood motionless, staring into the darkening woods. The guards had resumed their posts, waiting for our signal to secure the gates.

"Grayson," Nathan finally broke the silence. "I've got Evelyn and Sebastian heading to the manor."

"Sebastian?" I raised an eyebrow.

"Discharged himself against medical orders. Doc just finished stitching him up when he declared himself fit and left."

Shaking my head, I strode past Nathan to the driver's seat. Not that I could blame him - I'd have done the same. Besides, he'd claimed this injury wasn't nearly as bad as the last one.

We arrived at Rosewood Manor simultaneously with the others. Scarlett tried to assist Sebastian but he stubbornly insisted on helping her instead, despite his obvious pain. Oliver had already helped Audrey from the car before I could reach her.

"Did Oliver mention Magnus and Victoria showed up?" Sebastian asked as we entered. I settled Audrey into her chair and draped a blanket over her shoulders.

"Let's discuss this outside," I suggested, turning toward the door.

"No." Audrey's quiet voice stopped me mid-step.

"No?" I turned back, surprised. The room tensed, everyone holding their breath.

"It's alright. I want to hear this." Audrey's voice was barely above a whisper but firm. She crossed her arms over the blanket.

"You're certain?"

"Completely." She nodded once.

"Okay." Evelyn sat down while the rest of us remained standing. "How's the arm?" I asked Sebastian.

"I'll survive." He blinked rapidly, trying to mask his discomfort. Scarlett rolled her eyes dramatically at his bravado.

###Chapter 0401

Magnus and Victoria were waiting at the gates. Magnus wanted us to hear him out before we executed him, and Victoria was pleading for his life. He claimed he had to choose between the mate bond and Raphael, making it impossible for him to return to Lorenzo’s side.

"He’d rather die by our hands than Lorenzo’s," Nathan added.

"Is he expecting mercy?" Sebastian asked, his voice sharp.

"No. He just wants to speak. I think he’s trying to convince us not to kill Victoria," I replied.

"This is a sudden change of heart. Yesterday, he was ready to slaughter us all," Oliver pointed out.

"I’m questioning his motives. But regardless, he can’t walk free," I said, though I wasn’t entirely sure how to handle this.

"Agreed. Was he injured?" Sebastian pressed.

"Yes. He’s at the infirmary now, getting patched up before being taken to the cells," I confirmed.

"What about Victoria? What did she say?" Audrey asked. We all turned to her before answering.

"She claimed she got drunk and stumbled into a bar. She mated him without knowing who he was. Now she’s stuck with him," I summarized.

"I can believe that. People make reckless choices when they’re hurting," Scarlett said, defending Victoria. That surprised me—she’d never been fond of her.

"I don’t disagree, but that doesn’t excuse her trying to break into my office and steal intel for Lorenzo," I countered.

"True, but what if she was doing it to save Magnus?" Scarlett argued. "There might be more to her story."

"Maybe Magnus forced her. The mate bond is powerful," Audrey suggested.

"There’s more," I said, locking eyes with Audrey. "Xavier met with Victoria before she found Magnus. She gave him the stolen blueprints, and he altered them. Xavier was playing both sides. We only intervened because he got caught—otherwise, we would’ve let it play out."

"Is he alive?" Audrey asked after a heavy silence.

"Yeah, and that’s how I got fucking shot—dragging his sorry ass out," Sebastian snapped, wincing as he tried to cross his arms.

Audrey looked from Sebastian to me, her expression unreadable, her emotions eerily flat. "Thank you for saving him. I was starting to wonder how many of his nine lives he had left."

"He’s got at least one, but he’s in the cells now. He’ll answer for his treason," I told her. She didn’t argue or purse her lips like I expected. Instead, she just nodded, lost in thought.

"What now?" Scarlett asked.

"Tomorrow, we interrogate all three of them and decide their fates. You two won’t be there," I said firmly.

"Fine," Scarlett shrugged. Her easy compliance shocked me—even Sebastian looked taken aback.

"Best I can offer is video and audio," I tried to compromise.

"No need," Audrey shook her head. "Some things I don’t need to witness."

"I’m not executing anyone tomorrow. We’ll hear them out first," I promised.

"What outcome are you hoping for?" Scarlett asked.

"No idea. This isn’t how I expected tonight to go."

"Are you really going to sentence Victoria to death?" Audrey asked, her voice chillingly devoid of emotion.

###Chapter 0402


"She's just another pack member now."
My mind swirled with uncertainty about how this would play out. "But I'll hear what she has to say first. Right now, we all need rest. Tomorrow will handle itself."

"Fine. I'll be back at dawn." Sebastian extended his hand toward me.

"Perfect." I shook it firmly before turning to Oliver. "Thank you, Oliver. For everything." His grip was solid as he nodded, watching Sebastian and Nathan exchange handshakes.

Scarlett huffed, crossing her arms. "Since when did we start acting like business partners instead of family?"

"Respect isn't about formality." I kissed her cheek, lingering just enough to smell her jasmine perfume. "Go get some sleep."

"Whatever." She rolled her eyes as they exited together.

Nathan ran a hand through his hair. "What did she expect? A group hug?"

Audrey stretched lazily. "How's Cassandra?"

"Honestly? No clue." Nathan's shoulders tensed. "Thankfully, you've all kept me too busy to dwell on it."

"Has she tried explaining?" Audrey pressed.

"Bits and pieces." His jaw clenched. "Still claims innocence. Says she buried that part of her life and wanted to keep it buried—just focus on the future."

Audrey wobbled as she stood. I steadied her with a hand. "Can't fault her for that," she murmured, shuffling toward the kitchen for water.

"Guess not." Nathan shrugged.

"I'll see you tomorrow." I gave him an easy exit.

He ducked his head and slipped out the front door.

"Ready for bed?" I asked Audrey.

"God, yes." She yawned dramatically. I let her ascend the stairs first, admiring how her hips swayed despite her exhaustion.

"Big day tomorrow," I muttered, stripping down to my boxers. Audrey merely kicked off her leggings before collapsing onto the mattress, immediately cocooning herself in a fortress of pillows—three beneath her belly, two cradling her head. Where she'd stockpiled them remained a mystery.

By the time I finished showering the next morning, Audrey hadn't stirred. The crunch of tires on gravel announced Sebastian's arrival.

"Morning, sunshine," Scarlett chirped, breezing past me toward the coffee maker.

"Someone's cheerful." I raised an eyebrow.

"Caffeine," Sebastian explained dryly.

"Audrey's still asleep," I warned. "Isn't coffee bad for the baby?"

Scarlett snorted. "One cup won't sprout a third arm."

"Don't bother," Sebastian sighed. "Pregnancy has doubled her stubbornness."

"Figured." I lowered my voice. "Just don't wake her."

Scarlett mock-saluted before quietly closing the door behind us.

"Where's Oliver?" I asked as we slid into Sebastian's SUV.

"Five minutes out. Their newborn kept him up all night."

Sebastian and I wore nearly identical outfits—bloodstained sneakers, faded gym shorts, and black tees that wouldn't show stains. Practical attire for what lay ahead.

"Magnus or Victoria first?" Sebastian asked. "Save Xavier for last."

"Magnus." My fingers drummed against the door. "I'm dying to hear his version of events."

Sebastian nodded. "I'll back you up, but this is your show."

The interrogation block loomed ahead. Guards nodded us through to where Magnus sat chained to a chair, looking bored.

"Magnus." I let the door slam behind me.

###Chapter 0403

"Finally. I was beginning to wonder if you'd abandoned me." Magnus's gaze flickered between me and Sebastian. Sebastian remained by the doorway, arms crossed like an immovable statue. I dragged a chair across the concrete floor, its legs screeching in protest, and positioned myself directly before Magnus.

"Speak." My voice cut through the damp air of the cell.

Magnus tilted his head, a smirk playing on his lips. "What if I've changed my mind?"

"Then this knife gets acquainted with your flesh before I end you publicly. A spectacle for the pack." I twirled the blade between my fingers, catching the dim light.

"That would make quite a few people happy." He attempted to shift but the restraints held firm.

"How's the wound?" I asked casually.

"Survivable. Endured worse." His exaggerated sigh echoed off the stone walls.

"Enough games. You demanded this meeting." I leaned forward, elbows on knees. "Or shall I pay Victoria a visit instead?"

His eyes turned to slits. "You wouldn't dare."

"Treason carries consequences, Magnus. Or do you actually care for her?" I feigned surprise, pressing a hand to my chest.

"She's innocent in all this!" The chains rattled as he strained against them.

"Start from the beginning. How did you meet?" I reclined, crossing my ankles as if we were old friends sharing stories over drinks.

"Moonhowl Club. Recognized her on the dance floor. The mate bond... it overwhelmed me." His shoulders slumped. "Now she's trapped in this nightmare because of me. She's good, Evelyn. Tried to convince me to leave this life behind."

"Do you even want out?" My boot tapped an impatient rhythm. "Domestic bliss isn't for everyone."

A long pause. Then, barely audible: "I don't know. But I want... I need to be with her."

"Why introduce her to Raphael?" This had puzzled me most. "You signed her death warrant."

His jaw worked silently before answering. "No choice. Raphael discovered I'd been hiding a girl at my cabin. When Raphael gives an order, you obey. Disobedience means a bullet in the back."

"Raphael's endgame?" No more dancing around.

"Capture Audrey. Rebuild Dominic's trafficking ring. Auction girls to the highest bidder."

I scoffed. "Not interested in the Alpha title?"

"The title follows Audrey. Control her, and the power comes easily." A shrug that spoke volumes.

The implications made my stomach churn. "His exact plans?"

"Infiltrate more spies into Audrey's new projects. Or just snatch her outright."

"Vague and predictable." I made a show of checking my nails. "Disappointing."

Magnus's sudden grin sent chills down my spine. "Did you know about the attack planned for her Luna ceremony?"

I schooled my features. "Enlighten me."

"If he can't take her, he'll kill her." The words landed like stones. Three days. That's all we had.

"Details."

"Don't have any. Just know it's happening." His eyes fixed on a crack in the ceiling.

"So you've burned bridges with Raphael?"

"Probably. Not entirely certain."

I changed tack. "Does Raphael have tails on his men?"

"No surveillance teams, but cameras everywhere. Either he watches personally or assigns warriors."

A plan crystallized in my mind—risky, potentially deadly. Xavier, Magnus, Victoria... collateral damage if things went south.

"How badly do you want a life with Victoria? Free of Raphael?" I studied his reaction.

His gaze turned calculating. "Why?"

"I've got a proposition."

"Let's hear it." He leaned forward despite the restraints.

Rising abruptly, I needed Xavier's input first. "Be right back."

"Wait! Explain!" Magnus's shout followed me down the corridor.

Xavier sat upright on his cot as I approached. "Come here." He hesitated but obeyed, wariness in every movement.

"What now?" His voice rasped from disuse.

I whispered the plan into his ear, watching his expression shift from skepticism to reluctant agreement. The pieces were moving. Time was running out.

###Chapter 0404

"You can't possibly mean this." Sebastian stared at me as if I'd lost my mind.

"Do you have a better idea?" I countered. We were stepping out of the prison cells. Before we reached the open air, I turned to face him.

"I don't, but this is insane. A thousand things could go wrong."

"It's a risk I'm willing to take."

"Your call," Sebastian said sharply. "But as your ally—no, as your friend—hell, as your brother, I'm telling you I don't agree with this."

"Are you going to stand with me or not?" I demanded.

"Obviously." He didn't hesitate.

"Anything else you need to say? Once we leave, we're a united front."

"Damn it, Grayson… no." He exhaled harshly, pacing away before spinning back around.

"Good." I turned and strode forward. "Make the announcement."

Closing his eyes, Sebastian and I simultaneously sent out the command through the pack link.

"Attention all members! Report immediately to Crimson Fang Pack for a public trial and execution."

In a separate channel, we addressed the warriors. "Load your weapons with the blue rounds."

"Well, no turning back now," Sebastian muttered, glancing up at the overcast sky. The day matched the heaviness in my chest.

"What the hell is happening?" Audrey's furious voice exploded in my mind.

"Just trust me," I pleaded.

"Do I even want to know?"

"Have Oliver bring you and the others to the trial grounds."

The guards dragged Magnus, Victoria, and Xavier forward in chains, their heads bowed as they passed us.

"Evelyn is going to murder you," Sebastian muttered under his breath as we followed.

"Audrey's already in line for that," I sighed.

As we approached the clearing, pack members scrambled to prepare the execution site. The method? My choice. Today, it would be a lethal injection.

I wasn't going to pretend I wasn't nervous. But outwardly, I remained composed. This was necessary.

As more people arrived, I mentally ran through every possible alternative, but this was the only path forward. Dangerous? Absolutely. But if it worked, everything would fall into place.

The only one I pitied was Victoria. Still, she'd made her choices. Now she'd face the consequences.

"GRAYSON!" Audrey's shout cut through the murmurs of the crowd.

"Your show," Sebastian muttered before we turned.

"Thanks, brother," I shot back sarcastically.

"Can we talk about this?" Audrey's eyes burned with fury.

I pulled her aside, lowering my voice. "Trust me. We'll talk after."

"Tell me now!" She stomped her foot, and I barely suppressed a laugh at the unexpected outburst.

"Audrey. Please." I locked eyes with her, my voice dropping to a whisper. "Baby, I need you to trust me just this once."

Something in my tone must have reached her. She bit back whatever retort was on her tongue, though her glare didn't soften. With a huff, she stormed off and dropped into a chair, arms crossed.

Scarlett, Sebastian's mate, shot me a venomous look. "You're an ass."

"Go sit down," I said flatly. If the pregnant women wanted to be mad, they could do it from a chair.

Scarlett scoffed but obeyed, plopping down beside Audrey.

"I've never seen them this pissed," Nathan remarked, watching them glare daggers at me.

"Thanks for the support," I muttered.

A tearful Vivienne appeared next, sitting on Audrey's other side. Audrey wasn't happy, but she wasn't distraught either—just simmering.

Soon, the entire pack had gathered in tense silence. Some glared at Xavier and Magnus, while others eyed Victoria in confusion.

I knew what I was about to do. And yeah, I felt like shit. But they'd find out the truth soon enough.

###Chapter 0405

Stepping forward, I took a deep breath before addressing the gathered crowd. "Thank you all for leaving your duties to be here today. Since the Silvercrest Pack is practically an extension of Crimson Fang, I believed it necessary for everyone to witness this." Murmurs spread through the assembly as I continued. "What you may not know is that our packs face a new danger."

Gasps erupted instantly.

"Who?" someone shouted.

"Where?" another voice demanded before I raised my hand for silence.

"While we were focused on Damian and Dominic, Raphael and Magnus here managed to slip away. Raphael has decided to revive a side business Dominic started." My voice hardened. "But he lost his buyers—and now demands Luna Audrey as proof of his capability."

The crowd erupted in outrage.

"However," I said, cutting through the noise, "we've gathered evidence, which brings us to today."

I moved toward the three prisoners, starting with Xavier. "This is Xavier. As you know, he is Luna Audrey's biological father." The crowd hissed. "He's charged with playing both sides—not only has he killed, but he lied to me and caused more harm than good to your Luna." My gaze swept over them. "He is formally charged with treason. I find him guilty. His sentence is death by lethal injection."

Vivienne sobbed uncontrollably while Audrey glared daggers at me. "END HIM!" a voice roared from the back.

Ignoring the outburst, I shoved Xavier aside and seized Magnus. "This is Magnus. We captured him after a long pursuit." The crowd tensed. "He is charged with crimes against Luna Audrey and Luna Evelyn. He participated in Luna Evelyn's abduction and is responsible for multiple murders."

A wave of fury rippled through the pack.

"Finally," I said, gripping Victoria's arm and yanking her forward. She kept her face lowered until I forced her head up by her hair. "Victoria is Magnus's true mate. She aided him by breaking into my office and stealing critical documents." My voice turned icy. "She is charged with treason and sentenced to death by lethal injection."

Victoria trembled violently as I pushed her back. Magnus twitched as if fighting the urge to reach for her but stayed still.

"Alpha," the doctor murmured, presenting three syringes.

"Purple, correct?" I asked under my breath.

"Yes, Alpha. I verified it myself," he assured before stepping away.

"Any last words before I administer justice?" I demanded.

Xavier and Magnus lifted their chins and shook their heads. Victoria could barely stand, her legs shaking too hard to speak. Ignoring her silence, I met Xavier's gaze—there was an understanding between us. When I plunged the needle into his shoulder, I felt nothing. His eyes rolled back instantly, and he collapsed forward—dead.

Setting the syringe aside, I picked up the next one and turned to Magnus. He gave a single nod. The needle pierced his arm, and seconds later, he too crumpled to the ground—lifeless.

"PLEASE! NO!" Victoria shrieked, but the guards held her firm. "I'M SORRY!" Tears streamed down her face as she thrashed. Gripping the final syringe, I felt like the worst kind of monster—but I did it anyway. A guard pinned her flailing body as I injected her. Like the others, she collapsed face-first onto the dirt—gone.

Vivienne's hysterical cries slowly quieted as she stared at Xavier's body, then at me.

"Thank you all for coming," I said, voice steady. "Return to your duties. We're still handling the threat from Raphael. Stay vigilant, but do not panic. Live carefully—but live."

The crowd dispersed, murmurs lingering in the air like ghosts.

###Chapter 0406

The crowd dispersed without protest. "B-but he's not—"

"Shut your damn mouth." I stepped into Vivienne's personal space, issuing my command in a hushed growl.

Her eyes widened as she stumbled backward. "Grayson?" Audrey's confused voice cut through the tension.

"Take Vivienne to my office. Stay there until Sebastian and I return. Oliver and Nathan—you're in charge." My gaze swept across the gathered warriors. "Silvercrest warriors!"

Instantly, armed men materialized around me.

"Alpha!" Their voices rang in unison.

"No questions. Follow my lead. Weapons down until my signal."

"Yes, Alpha!" The response echoed through the trees.

"Load the bodies gently into the truck bed." To their credit, no one questioned why we weren't burning the traitors' remains as protocol demanded.

Within minutes, our convoy rumbled down the forest road. The cab remained silent—I wouldn't risk discussing strategy before my warriors. This plan balanced on a knife's edge, and the most dangerous phase still loomed ahead.

"Hold!" I barked. Producing three syringes from my jacket, I approached the corpses. These were specialized trackers—injected beneath the tongue where no routine exam would discover them. Unless someone performed an autopsy, the devices would remain undetected.

"Move out." I slid back into the truck, exchanging a glance with Sebastian. The trackers were our secret.

After thirty tense minutes, Sebastian signaled the driver to slow. "There." His whisper carried through the cabin.

Peering through the pines, I spotted the hunting lodge Magnus had described. "Warriors, hold position. Maintain visual perimeter."

"But Alpha—"

"Was I unclear?" My eyes darkened with warning.

The warrior bowed. "Yes, Alpha."

Sebastian and I hauled the lifeless forms toward the structure. Dead weight dragged at my muscles—Xavier and Victoria felt heavier in death than in life.

Security cameras swiveled toward us as we approached. Perfect.

"Lorenzo! Brought you a gift." We dumped the bodies with theatrical force. "I don't negotiate with traitors." The camera lens tracked the corpses before refocusing on us. "Next delivery will be your own carcass."

We retreated to the trucks under the watchful eye of unseen sentries.

"Any movement?" Sebastian murmured.

"Negative, Alpha."

"Roll out!" The return journey passed in suffocating silence. "Warriors—this never happened. Understood?"

Their synchronized "Yes, Alpha" followed us into the packhouse.

Sebastian groaned as we climbed the porch steps. "Now comes the fun part."

The office door exploded with accusations before I fully opened it.

"Why is Vivienne screaming about still feeling her mate bond with Xavier?" Audrey's fury radiated hot enough to make me second-guess our ruse. "Did you even kill him?"

###Chapter 0407

"Mind if I take a seat?" I asked, brushing past Evelyn. Her piercing gaze followed me, along with Audrey and Vivienne's, as I made my way to my desk. Sebastian trailed silently behind me. I booted up my computer, pulling up the tracking app that would monitor their every move.

"Grayson!" Audrey stomped her foot, frustration evident.

"Audrey, how many times do I have to ask you to trust me and be patient?" My voice was tight. "Let me finish this, and then I'll explain." Her lack of patience was grating on my nerves. Did she really have so little faith in me that she couldn’t wait a few more minutes?

I turned back to the screen, activating the three separate trackers. Instantly, their vitals and locations appeared—not just a blip on a map, but precise coordinates. Even if the map failed, I’d still know exactly where they were.

"They're awake," Sebastian murmured, pointing at the heart rate monitors.

"That was faster than expected. We barely had enough time." I frowned.

"Maybe the dosage wasn’t adjusted for their body weight?" Sebastian suggested.

"Victoria’s up," I noted, recognizing her by her significantly lower blood pressure compared to the men’s.

"They're moving," Sebastian observed after a pause. Right on cue, all three dots shifted direction—southward, but still together.

"Someone needs to monitor this constantly."

"For what, exactly?" Sebastian crossed his arms.

"Their vitals. If anything spikes, we can move into position." I wasn’t about to leave them completely vulnerable.

"We can’t interfere. That would ruin the entire plan," Sebastian countered, shaking his head.

"I know, but this requires a lot of trust." My doubts crept in again.

"Time to fill everyone in," Sebastian said, reaching down to press the lockdown button. The room sealed instantly—windows shielded with bulletproof metal, the door reinforced with steel blocks. No one was getting in or out.

"Is this really necessary?" Scarlett asked, raising an eyebrow.

"For this plan to work? Absolutely." I met each of their stares—Audrey, Vivienne, and Scarlett standing before me, while Oliver and Nathan lingered on either side, looking bored.

"I’ll give Grayson full credit for this," Sebastian said, dropping into a chair behind me.

"Thanks," I muttered, rolling my eyes.

"I know Xavier is still alive," Vivienne said quietly.

"Correct. They’re all alive. I faked their deaths to put them back on Lorenzo’s radar. With luck, they’ll either stay hidden or infiltrate his circle again."

"I don’t understand…" Audrey looked lost.

"As much as I despise Xavier and his methods, he hasn’t actually harmed us. It didn’t go as planned, but his choices are his own. He hasn’t crossed an unforgivable line. Still, he’s a man who thrives in the shadows. It’s what he knows."

"You gave him another chance," Vivienne said, studying me.

"Exactly. I saved him from Lorenzo. The poison I used slows the heart to mimic death. Eventually, it returns to normal. I dumped their bodies at one of Lorenzo’s hideouts—courtesy of Magnus’s intel. The idea was for Lorenzo to think I killed them, but when they wake up, they’ll convince him I botched the poisoning."

"They knew about this?" Audrey asked.

"Every detail. It was my idea, but Xavier and Magnus agreed immediately. Victoria? Well, she made her choices. I couldn’t punish the men and let her off the hook. I had to make it convincing."

"So they were never in real danger?" Audrey concluded.

"Actually, they’re at greater risk now. It’s up to them how they proceed—stay hidden or confront Lorenzo. The deal was simple: bring me Lorenzo, dead or alive. If they deliver intel or his head, their past sins are forgiven. Magnus gets to live and join our pack—with conditions. Xavier gets his life and the knowledge that his daughter is safe. Victoria gets a second chance."

"She only acted out because of the mate bond," Scarlett pointed out.

"True. She was desperate to save Magnus and made bad calls, but she did leave that warning note. Regardless, she committed treason. If she succeeds, she can return to the pack." My tone left no room for argument.

###Chapter 0408

"Did she agree to this?" Audrey questioned, her voice laced with concern.

"Not willingly, but she had no other choice. She wanted to clear her name, so this was her only option." Grayson's tone was detached, as if discussing a stranger rather than a former pack member.

"What if they die?" Audrey pressed.

"Magnus was already marked for death—either by my hand or Lorenzo's. At least this way, he gets a shot at survival. As for Victoria, she was facing banishment or imprisonment. No matter her reasons, she still chose to betray us. What if we hadn’t planted false intel for her to feed Lorenzo? She could’ve cost countless lives. That’s not something you forgive with a slap on the wrist. I get why she did it, but she could’ve come to me. Instead, she went behind my back."

"And Xavier?" Vivienne interjected.

"Xavier was furious he got caught. I know you two are mates, but domestic life isn’t for him. He was itching to get back out there, to protect Audrey by any means. I hate his methods, but as long as Audrey stays safe, I’ll turn a blind eye—until he crosses a line." Grayson’s words were directed more at Vivienne than anyone else.

"Why were you so against this?" Scarlett asked Sebastian.

"We let Magnus walk. He could easily go back to his old ways. After everything he’s done, he could flip us off and betray his word—not that his word means anything. I wanted Magnus dead, Victoria banished, and Xavier sent back into the field."



"Is there no way to forgive Victoria?" Audrey pleaded. "Couldn’t she face punishment and then be pardoned?"

"Audrey, she only took that job to get close to you. She wanted access to the buildings you designed—entry points for Lorenzo. Every move she made was calculated by Magnus. She had a choice: come to me and fix this together, or betray the pack. If we hadn’t caught her, she might’ve been one of the assassins sent to kill you at the Luna ceremony. Would she have hesitated if it meant saving Magnus? If Lorenzo held a knife to his throat, she’d have slit yours without blinking."

"I actually agree with Grayson on this," Sebastian cut in. "Victoria’s priority was Magnus, not the pack. Call it the mate bond, but she still had free will."

"Anyone would do anything to save their mate," Audrey argued stubbornly.

"Would you die—let our children die—if it meant sparing Magnus?" Grayson countered. Audrey blinked, stunned. "We sacrifice for the pack, but the pack comes first. You’re carrying our heirs. If we die, what happens then? Your life outweighs Magnus’s. Why do you think Lorenzo is so desperate to get to you?" His voice was calm but edged with steel.

Audrey placed a hand over her belly and sank into a chair. "I know it’s harsh, but he’s right. Even if Grayson let Victoria stay, no one would trust her. She’d be shunned, bullied, treated like trash."

Sebastian rested a hand on Audrey’s shoulder.

"We could’ve found her another pack—"

"How?" Scarlett scoffed. "Call another Alpha and say, ‘Hey, want a traitor we’re exiling?’ Would you take someone like that?"

Audrey sighed. "No… This whole situation is just awful."

"It is," Grayson agreed. "But my options were limited. This was a risk—one that might backfire or turn out to be the best decision I’ve ever made."

"So, no one outside this room can know," Nathan spoke up for the first time.

"Exactly. The fewer who know, the better."

"Do they know they’re being tracked?" Audrey asked.

"No. They think they’re operating under the radar."

"Damn, that’s ruthless," Oliver muttered, pacing.

"I’m not leaving them completely unprotected. I’ve got someone helping me, and we’ll monitor the situation closely."

"So… you’re giving them a chance to live?" Audrey asked softly.

###Chapter 0409

"I'll do whatever it takes—within reason—to ensure their survival. They were given a choice. Every single one of them, including Victoria, agreed to it. No one was forced. They made this decision freely. I won’t pretend this doesn’t benefit me, but there’s hardly any downside."

"If Xavier dies, so do I." Vivienne clarified.

"Xavier isn’t in any more danger than he was yesterday. I just let him keep doing things his way. Not that I approve, but that’s beside the point."

"You can hate this all you want, but it’s our reality. Our options were limited. Arguing won’t change anything. Objectively, this was the best choice." Sebastian placed his hands on the desk, signaling the end of the debate.

"Since we were excluded from the decision-making, I believe I have every right to be involved. I am an Alpha, after all." Audrey said, crossing her arms.

"Then start acting like one." Sebastian narrowed his eyes at her.

"Alright, I think it’s time we leave." Scarlett stepped between them. "Fighting among ourselves won’t help. Emotions are running high—we all need to cool off." She took Sebastian’s arm, and the three of them—Sebastian, Scarlett, and Oliver—left the office.

"Vivienne, give us a moment alone." I said, locking eyes with her.

"Yes, Alpha." She placed a hand on Audrey’s shoulder and walked out, Nathan closing the door behind them.

"I should’ve been included. You had no right to make that decision without me."

"You haven’t been acting like an Alpha! Didn’t you ask me to handle things? This wasn’t directly about you." My anger simmered beneath the surface.

"I came back and said I wanted to be involved!" Audrey planted her hands on her hips.

"You can’t have it both ways. Either you’re fully committed, or you trust me to make decisions for the pack. Just because you disagree doesn’t mean you get to question my leadership." My palms slammed against the desk as I stood.

"Okay…" Nathan intervened. "Grayson, let’s take a walk."

He was right. We needed space. I stormed past Audrey, out of the office, and into the open air.

"Damn it!" I growled, stomping down the porch steps.

"Over here." Nathan guided me toward the gazebo in the garden.

"Why?"

"We need to talk." His tone left no room for argument.

"I don’t want to talk about Audrey." I muttered stubbornly as he took a seat.

"Neither do I." He shrugged, gesturing to the bench across from him.

"Then what?" I asked, though I didn’t move.

"Cassandra."

"What about her?" With a sigh, I dropped onto the bench, draping my arms over the backrest.

"I think I’m ready to move on."

"Okay." I shrugged. I’d expected this—it was only a matter of time.

"Only because I don’t have another choice. I can’t believe she was mates with him, but I knew she had a past. It’s just… hard. I need to know what happened to Seraphina."

"Nothing’s changed. She’s still locked up in Sebastian’s cells."

"Cassandra wants to face her. One last step to put the past behind her." Nathan’s words were more statement than question.

"You think that’s wise?"

"It can’t get much worse. Nothing about this is good, but… maybe it’ll help her heal. Seeing her brought up too much, and now she’s back to flinching at touch."

"What do you want from me?" I asked, unsure where he was going with this. "You didn’t need my permission."

"I… I don’t think Cassandra should hold a position of authority here." Nathan stood abruptly, pacing in agitation. "There. I said it." He threw his hands up in frustration.

###Chapter 0410

"Oh." I hesitated, unsure how to respond. There wasn't a rule stating she couldn't step down as Beta female. Audrey could easily find a replacement—though finding the right one would be the real challenge.

"I'm sorry, but given our conversations, she has too much unresolved trauma. Maybe one day she'll be ready for that role, but right now, she needs to focus on healing."

"Okay," I said simply.

"Okay?" Nathan stared at me as if expecting more.

"Nathan, making decisions for the pack isn’t easy—especially when it involves your mate. You're acting like a true Beta. If Cassandra needs help, move mountains to get it for her. We’ll manage until she’s ready."

"Thanks. I thought you’d be upset."

"Why? She needs help. I can’t imagine the horrors she’s endured. The first step to healing is facing the past. Now that she knows you’re on her side, she’ll have your support through it all."

"Okay. Can she leave the room?"

"We need to speak with her again first," I said. Nathan nodded but stayed silent.

Saya

"Can we do that now?" Nathan finally asked.

"Sure." I had calmed enough to handle it. Standing, we walked back to the pack house.

"I’ll get her and meet you in your office," Nathan said.



"Okay." I headed to my office while he went to their room. Inside, Audrey sat at her desk. "Nathan’s bringing Cassandra in to talk. She’s going to get therapy before resuming her duties." I settled behind my desk and turned on my computer.

"Should I leave?" Audrey asked.

"You’re free to do whatever you want." Glancing at the trackers, I noticed they’d split up. My phone buzzed with a message:

Unknown: Magnus is back with Lorenzo.

There was also a missed call from him—one I needed to return. But with Nathan arriving soon, I didn’t have time.

"I’ll stay." Audrey moved to the chair across from me. Silence stretched between us, thick and heavy, until a knock shattered it.

"A-Alpha." Cassandra bowed as she entered.

"Cassandra, come in. Sit."

She hesitated before taking a seat, her voice barely above a whisper. "Thank you for seeing me."

"Of course. What can I do for you?"

"I wanted to apologize for not telling you the full truth. I was afraid of how everyone would react."

"Is there anything else you need to tell me?" I asked.

"I... I’d prefer to confess everything to Nathan privately. He can relay anything you need to know. If that’s alright with you, I’d like to keep it between us. It’ll be easier for me to face my past this way."



"I’ll respect that—as long as you understand Nathan has a duty to inform me of anything affecting pack security or the Luna. Don’t let that stop you from opening up to him. I’m proud of you for seeking help. But for now, I think you should take a break from Beta duties. Heal first. We’ll revisit your role later."

"I understand. I’m sorry it’s come to this. I should’ve spoken up sooner."

"Just know I’m granting this leniency because Nathan is your mate. Don’t make me regret it—but I want you to get better."

"I won’t. Thank you." Cassandra stood. "One more thing..."

###Chapter 0411

"What is it?" I asked, my pulse quickening.

"Dominic used to mark his... girls. They'd get a rose tattoo on their shoulder blade if they were part of his operation."

Nathan shifted his weight, avoiding my gaze. I'd noticed a few of those tattoos before but never thought much of them. "Thanks for telling me," I finally said.

Cassandra nodded, and she and Nathan left the office. "What now?" Audrey asked.

"Not sure yet. Keep tracking their movements, maybe do some recon myself. We've got your Luna ceremony on Saturday. Best to stay under the radar until we have solid proof of an attack."

"Do you really think we should still hold the ceremony after what happened at Grayson's?"

"We're better prepared this time."

"I thought you were prepared last time too," Audrey narrowed her eyes at me.

"It's handled," I said, turning my attention back to the tracking device.

Victoria's POV

"Victoria, wake up!" Magnus shook me roughly. The more I tried to ignore him, the harder his grip became. "VICTORIA!" he hissed.

"What?" I groaned, struggling to remember where I was. The last twenty-four hours had been a waking nightmare. The terror of being injected with something that could have actually killed me—not just faked it—still clung to me.

Now, I was stuck in this rotting shack. No blankets, barely any walls—just gaping holes where the wind howled through. The cold seeped into my bones.

"They're here!" Magnus leapt off the stained mattress and started pacing.

"They? As in Lorenzo?" I lifted my head, my tangled hair blocking my view.

"Yes! Get up!" His whisper was urgent. Every muscle protested as I forced myself upright, smoothing my torn clothes as best I could.

"Where are they?" I whispered, watching Magnus scan the surroundings.

"Everywhere," he muttered. A chill slithered down my spine. "Come on."

Magnus yanked open the door, and I saw them—figures emerging from the trees. The sun was barely up, casting long shadows that made it impossible to count how many there were.

"Magnus. What a... surprise. I watched you die." Lorenzo stood in the clearing, arms folded.

"Believe me, I'm just as shocked as you are," Magnus said, stepping outside. I hovered in the doorway.

"Ah, and your mate survived too." Lorenzo's gaze locked onto me, cold and calculating.

"He used the same poison. Clearly, he botched the dosage," Magnus said, crossing his arms.

"So, I assume you're ready to rejoin us?" Lorenzo asked. More men materialized from the trees.

"That's the plan. We stay hidden, work from the shadows. Grayson thinks we're dead—we can use that."

Lorenzo smirked as thunder rumbled in the distance. "Let's continue this conversation somewhere more... comfortable. Follow me." He turned and strode away.

Every instinct screamed at me not to follow, but Magnus grabbed my arm and dragged me forward.

The walk felt endless. Within half an hour, rain poured down in sheets. No one spoke. No one broke formation. I tried to glance around, but Magnus kept forcing my gaze forward.

If it weren't for him holding me up, I would've face-planted in the mud a dozen times. My ankle throbbed with every step. Just as I was about to collapse, Lorenzo finally spoke.

"Home sweet home," he announced, arms spread wide.

The structure before us wasn't just a pack house—it was a damned fortress. Most pack houses were large, but this was something else entirely. Black stone, overgrown with vines, windows like hollow eyes staring back at us.

The place reeked of power and decay.

And we were walking straight into it.

###Chapter 0412

"Stop." A guard stepped forward, blocking our path as he began patting Magnus down.

"Strip." Another guard approached me, his voice cold.

"W-what?" I turned to Magnus, panic rising in my chest.

"It's standard procedure," Lorenzo drawled, watching with amusement. "No one enters my territory without being thoroughly searched. Can't risk traitors slipping through."

"She's clean," Magnus growled, his jaw clenched.

"We'll see for ourselves. Strip." Lorenzo's tone left no room for argument.

"But—" My fingers trembled as I clutched my shirt, backing away. My heart hammered violently. A guard pressed the barrel of a gun against the back of my head.

"Either you do it, or I'll do it for you," he sneered.

Hands shaking, I pulled my shirt over my head. I wasn't the most endowed, but I had enough to draw unwanted attention. The guards snickered, their eyes raking over me.

"The shorts," Lorenzo commanded.

Fumbling with the button, I finally managed to push them down, humiliation burning my cheeks. A tear slipped free, tracing a silent path down my face.

"Very nice," a guard murmured, running a finger down my spine. "You've got good taste, Magnus. We used to share, didn't we?"

"No." Magnus yanked me away, shoving my shirt into my arms. "Get dressed."



"Come," Lorenzo said, his gaze lingering on me. "We have a feast to prepare. My brother has returned… and found his mate."

I dressed hastily as we walked, nausea churning in my stomach. The castle’s interior was exactly what I’d expect from a man like Lorenzo—opulent, gaudy, and suffocating. Gold adorned every surface, velvet draped the staircases, and the gargoyle statues seemed to watch my every move. Even the antique portraits glared down at me with disdain.

Lorenzo led us up the stairs and down a dimly lit corridor before stopping abruptly. "This is your room. I’ve taken the liberty of preparing evening attire for you both. Dinner is in one hour in the grand dining hall. Don’t be late. We have much to discuss." He gave Magnus a pointed look before striding away.

Magnus shoved me inside and locked the door behind us. "He doesn’t trust me," he muttered aloud. Then, through the mind-link: "Don’t say anything private out loud. This room is wired."

"Seriously?" I replied silently, sinking onto the bed.

"Yes. Speak normally, but watch your words." He stripped off his shirt and tossed it into a basket.

"I have to wear this?" I eyed the blood-red dress laid out for me—low-cut, with a scandalous slit up the side.

"Yes. Shower and get ready." His tone was clipped, more irritated than angry—but not at me.

"I don’t ha—" I cut myself off as I entered the bathroom. An array of luxury products lined the counter, everything I could possibly need. Magnus turned on the water, steam billowing within seconds.

"Make it hot. The steam will fog the cameras," he instructed through the mind-link. "Stand in front of me. Undress and get in."

I obeyed, stepping out of my clothes and into the scalding water. The heat was almost unbearable, but it burned away the lingering shame of their stares. My skin flushed red as I grabbed the shampoo.

Then Magnus joined me.

I stiffened—I’d never shared a shower before. His smirk told me he noticed my surprise.

###Chapter 0413

"Never shared a shower with anyone?" His deep voice vibrated against the tiles.

I shook my head, droplets flying from my damp hair. "Never."

Magnus pressed me against the cool wall, his breath hot on my neck. "First time for both of us then." The water cascaded over his broad shoulders as he turned, giving me an unobstructed view of his sculpted back.

As I worked shampoo through my tangled locks, my fingers trembled. Every defined muscle in his body seemed designed to weaken my knees.

"Tonight," he growled suddenly, spinning me back under the spray. "When this is over, I'll take you anywhere you want. But right now, we don't have time for what I really want to do to you in here."

My breath hitched as his hands slid down my waist. "First we have to survive dinner," I reminded him, rinsing soap from my eyes.

Through our mind-link, his voice turned deadly serious. "I swear on my life, we're walking out of that dining hall alive." He pressed a finger to his lips - a silent warning about the listening devices.

"Done." I watched the last soap bubbles disappear down the drain.

Magnus cracked the shower door just enough to grab two plush towels. He tossed one to me before stepping out, water glistening on his tattooed skin. I took my time drying off, delaying the inevitable.

"Any underwear?" I asked hopefully.

"Lorenzo considers them unnecessary." Magnus rolled his eyes. Wrapping the towel tightly around myself, I found a hair dryer and began styling my damp locks. Magnus disappeared into the bedroom as I applied minimal makeup - enough to look presentable but not alluring.

"Five minutes!" His voice carried through the door.

Stepping out, I grabbed the crimson dress from the bed, keeping the towel secured until the last possible moment. The fabric slithered over my skin like liquid silk. Magnus appeared behind me to zip it up, his knuckles brushing my spine.

The dress clung to every curve, the plunging neckline leaving little to imagination. Normally I'd feel powerful in such an outfit. Tonight, it just made me feel like prey.

"These should fit." Magnus produced a pair of stiletto heels.

"How does he know my shoe size?" I whispered.

Magnus knelt to buckle the straps. "Lorenzo researches his guests like rare specimens. He probably knows your grandmother's maiden name better than you do." His watch beeped ominously. "Showtime."

I took his offered arm, my fingers digging into his bicep.

Through our connection, his mental voice was urgent. "Only speak when spoken to. Keep answers short. He already knows every lie before you think it."

The hallway stretched endlessly before us. Lorenzo waited at the far end, dressed in a tailored black tuxedo with a blood-red tie. The coordinated ensemble was so perfect it almost made me forget we weren't attending some macabre gala.

"You clean up nicely," I blurted before I could stop myself.

Magnus shot me a warning look before forcing a smile. "As do you, darling."

"Why red?" I asked softly.

Lorenzo materialized behind us like smoke. "The color of arterial blood, little wolf. And how I do love watching it spill." His fingers grazed my bare shoulder as he passed, leaving icy trails on my skin.

###Chapter 0414

"You got the perfect size," I said, forcing a confident tone despite the nerves coiling in my stomach.

"I see that. You look absolutely delectable." Lorenzo's grip tightened around my arm as he spun me in a slow circle, his gaze raking over me like I was a prize on display.

"What have you decided for dinner?" Magnus asked, his fingers brushing against mine before pulling me flush against him. The familiar sparks ignited beneath my skin, sending a shiver down my spine. More than once, I'd caught myself nearly moaning from just the barest touch of his hand. Right now, their presence was the only thing keeping me grounded.

"Roasted duck with asparagus and truffle mashed potatoes," Lorenzo announced, already striding forward. Magnus fell into step beside him without hesitation.

"One of your favorites," Magnus remarked dryly, though there was an edge to his voice—something almost amused.

"As I recall, it used to be yours too," Lorenzo shot back with a smirk. "Or have you forgotten how you devoured it off that whore's stomach?"

My stomach twisted as Magnus threw his head back and laughed—a sound too genuine for comfort. "Ah, good times. She nearly fainted when I picked up the carving knife."

"Good times indeed," Lorenzo agreed as we reached the dining hall.

The long table was already occupied, each man flanked by a woman who kept her head bowed, shoulders tense. Their fear was palpable.

Every eye tracked us as we approached the head of the table. Magnus pulled out my chair with exaggerated courtesy, earning a scoff from one of the men.

"Gentleman Magnus? Never thought I'd see the day," a man sneered, swirling his wine before taking a sip.

"Any real man knows how to treat a woman," Magnus replied smoothly, his gaze sharpening. "But then again, not everyone was raised with manners."

Following the other women's lead, I kept my head down, my fingers gripping the edge of the table.

"Dinner is served," Lorenzo announced, clapping his hands.

Servants in scandalously short uniforms emerged, balancing trays of food. One by one, plates were set before us. I made the mistake of glancing up just as one of the men grabbed a fistful of a passing girl's backside. She didn't react, but the pain in her eyes was unmistakable.

To his credit, Magnus looked disgusted.

"I see you've acquired new entertainment," he remarked coolly.

Lorenzo waved a dismissive hand. "Fresh investments. They're proving stubborn to train, but what can you expect? They're only women, after all."

He took the first bite, and the others followed suit. Even the women hesitantly picked up their utensils. I forced myself to cut into the duck, though my appetite had vanished.

"This is incredible!" a man across from me exclaimed, mouth full.

"MANNERS!" Lorenzo slammed his fist onto the table, making several women flinch—myself included. His eyes darkened with something terrifying, and my hands trembled as I forced myself to keep eating.

Under different circumstances, the meal might have been exquisite. But now, every bite tasted like sawdust. My mouth went dry, forcing me to gulp down the wine too quickly.

"Magnus," Lorenzo said after a stretch of silence, "now that you're back, I have a job for you."

"A job? You're giving him a job?" The same ill-mannered man scoffed.

Lorenzo's gaze snapped to him. "Are you questioning me?" His voice was lethally soft.

The man paled. "No, Lorenzo. Never. I only meant—I'm happy to take on any task you require."

"I don't require anything from a man who can't control his impulses," Lorenzo sneered. "This job requires precision, not distractions." He turned back to Magnus. "Meet me in my office after dinner."

"With pleasure," Magnus replied, his smirk directed at the chastised man.

Then Lorenzo's attention shifted to me.

"Ms. Victoria. I understand you're the former lover of Alpha Grayson of the Crimson Fang Pack."

It wasn't a question.

###Chapter 0415

"Indeed, sir." My voice came out hoarse as I cleared my throat. The wine was already clouding my senses—my lips tingled, my cheeks burned, and my limbs grew heavy with relaxation.

"Tell me," Lorenzo leaned forward, his gaze sharp. "Why didn’t Grayson make you Luna?"

"Because I wasn’t his mate," I admitted, my fingers tightening around the stem of my glass. "On his birthday, the truth became clear. We weren’t destined, so we ended things officially."

"Yet he wasn’t your first love."

His words struck like ice. My entire body stiffened. "He was the only one I ever called my boyfriend."

"What about Wesley Chambers?" Lorenzo wiped his mouth with a crisp linen napkin after finishing his mashed potatoes.

"We went on a few dates. Nothing serious. He was never my boyfriend."

"But you gave him your virginity."

Beside me, Magnus went rigid. He knew the truth—that Grayson wasn’t the only one—but I hadn’t corrected him when he assumed otherwise. The hypocrisy stung, considering his own history.

Since Magnus had warned me not to lie, I didn’t. "In the back seat of a Corvette."

A few men chuckled under their breaths.

Lorenzo’s lips curled. "I have a gift for you."

The way he said it forced my eyes up. Until now, I’d avoided meeting his gaze.

"A gift?" Magnus echoed, suspicion lacing his tone.

"Yes. Come see." Lorenzo stood, and the rest of us followed.

Magnus steadied me as I rose, his grip firm. We trailed Lorenzo out of the dining hall and down a dimly lit corridor. The air grew colder the farther we walked, until a heavy wooden door loomed ahead.

The moment we stepped outside, bile rose in my throat.

Wesley was strung up against a tree—not tied around it, but stretched taut in an X-shape, ropes pulling his limbs to their limits. His body hovered inches above the ground, suspended in agony.

"I assume you recognize him," Lorenzo mused.

My feet rooted to the spot, every emotion crashing through me at once.

"Yes."

"Magnus," Lorenzo continued smoothly, "what you don’t know is that Wesley here was Victoria’s first love. Not Grayson. Him."

"Where—" My voice cracked.

"Where did I find him?" Lorenzo finished for me. "I always knew our paths would cross again. So I took the liberty of testing your loyalty."

"Testing my loyalty?" My stomach twisted.

"Correct." Lorenzo seized my arm and dragged me toward a wooden table laden with weapons. "Prove you’re loyal to me. Kill him. Choose your weapon and finish it."

As if it were that simple.

"Pick up the gun and do it," Magnus commanded through the mind-link.

"I’ve never killed anyone," I whispered back. "I can’t." Tears blurred my vision.

"You don’t have a choice," he snarled. "I’m ordering you. Pick up the gun and pull the trigger."

Logically, I knew he couldn’t force me—but my body betrayed me. My hands moved on their own.

"NO! PLEASE!" Wesley’s screams tore through the night.

I didn’t even register which gun I grabbed. With both hands shaking, I aimed and fired.

The first shot missed entirely.

Tears streamed down my face as I squeezed the trigger again. This time, the bullet struck his thigh. Wesley howled in pain.

I fired once more. The shot grazed his side.

Then, I stopped thinking.

I pulled the trigger until the chamber clicked empty.

When I finally opened my eyes, the horror before me seared into my mind. None of my shots had been fatal—except one. A bullet had nicked an artery in his leg. Blood seeped out in a slow, torturous trickle.

"Not quite what I envisioned," Lorenzo remarked, almost impressed. "But he’ll bleed out soon enough. You could’ve walked closer."

The realization hit me like a sledgehammer as Wesley’s cries faded into silence.

I had just killed a man.

"I didn’t think she had it in her," one of the men joked behind me.

The world spun. My knees buckled.

But Lorenzo’s laughter was the last thing I heard before everything went black.

###Chapter 0416

My legs trembled with the urge to flee. Would Grayson ever welcome me back after this? Would he let us rejoin his pack, or had I just doomed us all?

"You did what was necessary," Magnus's voice echoed through our mind-link, as if he'd plucked the thought straight from my head.

"I shouldn't have been forced to," I muttered, refusing to glance at Wesley's lifeless form.

"No," Magnus agreed.

"I believe it's time for the men to retire to the study for drinks," Lorenzo announced, already striding back inside. "Afterward, Magnus and I have matters to discuss."

"Come on," Magnus said aloud, guiding me back into the house and up to our bedroom. Silence stretched between us until the door clicked shut behind us.

"Do I have anything to sleep in?" I asked, my voice small.

"No. We sleep bare."

"Can I at least wear your shirt?" I pleaded as he tugged his off.

"Not unless you want Lorenzo storming in here to correct that disobedience," he replied flatly, disappearing into the bathroom without another glance.

Defeated, I sank onto the bed. "Fine," I whispered.

"I have to meet the others for drinks. Don't wait up." He pressed a kiss to my forehead before leaving.

The moment he was gone, I scrambled to lock the door—only to find there wasn’t one. Anyone could walk in whenever they pleased, and I was powerless to stop it. Sliding beneath the covers, I wriggled until my dress pooled at my feet. I kicked it to the floor and yanked the blankets over my head.

Magnus's POV

"I was beginning to wonder if I'd need to drag you in here myself," Lorenzo remarked, sliding a whiskey toward me.

I dropped onto the leather couch—cold, despite its richness—and took a long sip.

"Had to piss," I muttered.

"So what the hell happened?" Donovan demanded. The bastard was all talk—couldn’t focus long enough to finish a job, though he had no trouble finishing on some girl.

"When everything went to shit?" I snarled, my grip tightening around the glass. "You mean when you bolted like a coward and left everyone defenseless? I don’t recall seeing you chase after Grayson and Sebastian to bring that bastard back."

Leaning forward, I slammed my drink down and locked onto him.

"I work better in the shadows."

"You mean you’re too spineless to fight face-to-face," I spat. "You only strike when their backs are turned." I drained the rest of my whiskey and leaned back, seething.

"How did Grayson catch you?" Lorenzo cut in.

"Got shot. Was bleeding out. My choices were take my chances with him or die in the damn woods." I scoffed, feigning anger. "Not like any of you came back for me. Not even you, Lorenzo. You left me there to rot."

"You know the rules. You were shot," Lorenzo said dismissively. "What concerns me more is how you’re still breathing."

"Yeah, explain that," Donovan chimed in again.

"I’ll knock your teeth down your throat if you open your mouth one more time," I warned.

Donovan wisely shut up.

"When I woke up, I was in their cells. They’d removed the bullet and stitched me up. Then the interrogation started."

"What did you tell him?" Lorenzo pressed.

"Nothing he didn’t already know. He figured out how you and Dominic operated for a while." I shrugged. "Might’ve mentioned a few… entertaining moments." I smirked, refilling my glass.

###Chapter 0417

"I don't buy it. You look untouched." Silas, one of the men in the room, scoffed. "I think you're playing for the wrong team. Not convinced."

"My wolf's healing isn't weak just because yours is pathetic. When have my injuries ever lasted more than a day? Look at this." I stood, yanking up my shirt to reveal the gunshot wound. The bruising had vanished, leaving only a faint scar.

"Magnus has always healed freakishly fast, and now he's got a mate," Tobias muttered, pouring himself a drink.

"Enough of this pissing contest. Anyone brave enough to step outside and test me?" I narrowed my eyes, scanning the room. Silence. Not a single one dared to meet my gaze.

"Get some rest, boys. Magnus, my office. Now." Lorenzo rose, drink in hand, and strode out. I refilled my glass before following.

"Watch your back. Lorenzo won't always be there to save you." The whisper came just as I reached the door.

I turned. My fist connected with Silas’s jaw before he could react. Teeth shattered. Blood sprayed. He crumpled, stunned by the force behind the blow—even with alcohol in my system.

"Deserved," someone muttered.

I didn’t stay to listen.

Lorenzo was barely seated when I entered his office.

"You took your time," he remarked as I shut the door.

"Had to remind Silas of his place."

"Can’t blame him." Lorenzo studied me, swirling his drink.



"I haven’t lied to you. You know that."

Lorenzo had an uncanny ability to detect lies. Sometimes it was unsettling. Mostly, it was useful.

Right now, it was neither.

"True. I’d know."

"What’s the job?" I asked when he didn’t continue.

He slid a vanilla envelope across the desk. Inside was a photo of an unremarkable man—average height, brown hair, brown eyes. The kind of face you’d forget instantly. His name: Mateo Rodriguez. No address. No number.

"Who is this?" I scanned the sparse file.

"The key to Alpha Alexander’s success. Grayson’s probably using him too."

"A spy," I said flatly.

"Call him what you want. He’s their eyes and ears. My guess? This is how Grayson got his intel. The other leak is that cockroach Xavier—if he’s even alive. But this man? Priority."

"How’d you find him?" I wasn’t shocked. Alphas always had someone doing their dirty work.

"I have my ways."

"You want him dead."

"Dead. But recognizable. I’m delivering him to Alpha Grayson."



"Any known hangouts?"

"A dive bar thirty minutes from the packs. Address is in the file. Start there."

"Victoria and I will head back tomorrow—"

"No." Lorenzo cut me off.

"No?"

"Victoria stays. Consider it... insurance. Complete the job, and I’ll believe you’re loyal. Fail?" He smirked. "I’ll have fun with her before I kill her. If you’re lucky, I won’t make you watch."

"That’s bullshit and you know it." Rage burned through me. After everything I’d done for him—this?

"You don’t have a choice. Succeed, or you both die. Victoria isn’t leaving. Find him quickly. The longer I wait, the less patience I have."

I hated Lorenzo. This was why I wanted out. He forced others to do his dirty work, never staining his own hands. Striking where it hurt most while he sat back, sipping scotch.

If Grayson didn’t kill him, I would.

Part of me wanted to do it now.

But I wouldn’t make it three steps before he’d have me pinned to the wall.

###Chapter 0418


"Don’t you dare lay a finger on her." My voice was a venomous hiss.

"Then I suggest you put those skills of yours to work and track him down. You know the drill. That’s why we make such a perfect team." Raphael smirked at me, his dark eyes glinting with amusement.

I opened my mouth to retort but snapped it shut as I stormed out of the office. Raphael didn’t bother stopping me as I stomped upstairs to check if Victoria was still asleep.

Grayson’s POV

"You ready?" I asked Sebastian.

"Always."

"Are you sure you don’t want more backup?" Audrey’s voice trembled with worry as she watched me strap on my gear.

"Too many bodies mean too many mistakes. We need to scout first—can’t do that with an army." My tone softened as I adjusted my holster. Sebastian and I were heading out to investigate where Magnus and Victoria had disappeared to. Xavier had been holed up in some dingy bar for hours, unmoving. But Magnus? He’d crossed state lines and stopped deep in the woods, near the base of a mountain. Curiosity gnawed at me. What was out there?

"I know, but… what if something goes wrong? You won’t have any reinforcements." Audrey’s eyes shimmered with unshed tears as I laced up my boots.

"I’ll come back to you. Have I ever broken a promise?" I cupped her face, forcing her to meet my gaze.

"There’s always a first time," she muttered stubbornly.



"Doubt it." Pulling her against me, I tried to pour every ounce of reassurance into the embrace. "I need you to stay strong. For them." My hand drifted to her stomach.

"The Luna ceremony is in two days. If you’re not there… there won’t be one." Audrey stepped back, her jaw set.

"I’ll be there with time to spare." I grabbed my phone and keys.

"We love you." She pressed a quick kiss to my lips before retreating.

Behind me, I heard Sebastian and Scarlett exchanging quiet goodbyes. I turned to Oliver. "You got this?"

"Not a single hair out of place," he vowed.

"I’m here too!" Nathan called from the couch. Cassandra was conspicuously absent—probably hadn’t broken the news to Audrey yet.

"See you soon." I shook my head, then locked eyes with Audrey. "Love you."

"Let’s move," Sebastian said.

"Later, sis." I dropped a kiss on Scarlett’s cheek and followed Sebastian out. We took my car—faster than running the whole way. No point exhausting our wolves before we even got there.

"Got everything?" Sebastian asked as we loaded up.

"Trunk’s stocked. Hope we won’t need half of it."

The tracking app on my phone showed no movement yet. "Couple hours to the location. Let’s hope they stay put." I merged onto the highway.



"Heard from your guy?" Sebastian asked.

"Radio silence the last few days. Sent a message—no reply."

"That normal for him?"

"Only checks in when he’s got intel."

"Might be in a tight spot." Sebastian leaned back, staring out the window.

"What’s the endgame here? When do we stop playing defense and just declare war?" Frustration simmered under my skin.

"We tried that with my pack. He won’t fall for it twice." Sebastian exhaled sharply. "We hit his base. Hard."

"If he sees us coming, we’re dead before we reach the gates." Raphael’s constant upper hand was pissing me off. "Maybe we play his game. Get our own inside man."

"Now that’s an idea." Sebastian’s gaze turned calculating.

My phone rang. The caller ID made me smirk. "Speak of the devil." I answered.

###Chapter 0419

"Grayson."

"I trailed Xavier since he's the most unpredictable one. He's holed up at a dive bar with an illegal gambling den underneath. Big players are coming and going tonight—most of them I've seen dealing with Alpha Damian."

"I'm starting to think Raphael has a mole. Can you identify who it is?"

"Name your price."

"Consider it paid." A chill ran down my spine at what he might demand, but Audrey's life was worth any cost.

"I knew I'd enjoy doing business with you." Click!

"Did he tell you the price?" Sebastian asked.

"One crisis at a time."

Sebastian scoffed before silence engulfed us. My mind raced with possibilities. According to the trackers, both signals remained steady—spikes in heart rates but no signs of torture or terror. Magnus was trained to withstand interrogation, but Victoria wasn't. She had no resistance training. Hopefully, Magnus had prepared her.

We only paused for a quick meal during the drive, pushing straight through. Under the cover of darkness, we found a seedy motel that wouldn't ask questions and booked a room.

"We're about an hour's walk from their location." Sebastian checked his phone again.

"Both signals still active?" I unzipped my duffel bag.



"Yeah. We've got two hours of daylight left. It'll take us an hour to reach them. We should move out in ninety minutes to stay under night's cover." He set his phone down and tossed his bag onto the bed.

"He'll have surveillance."

"This will detect cameras." Sebastian held up a device resembling miniature binoculars.

"If we tamper with them, we'll trigger alarms. We'll have to navigate around." The mission just got complicated.

"Could be motion sensors too. Prepare for radio silence."

"Pray there's no thermal imaging." Damn, I hoped not.

"Only one way to find out." Sebastian began unpacking more gear.

Magnus POV

"Victoria, wake up." I climbed onto the mattress and gently shook her. She didn't stir. Part of me wanted to let her sleep—she'd need the rest. Once I'm gone, sleep might evade her completely. Besides, it had been ages since she'd gotten proper rest.

She looked ethereal in slumber, her hair splayed across the pillow like spilled ink. As I brushed strands from her face, I marveled at her resilience. How the Moon Goddess chose her for me, I'll never know. I longed to be worthy of her, but fate had other plans. Curling beside her, I closed my eyes, accepting this might be my last peaceful night.



"Are you awake?" Her whisper tickled my ear.

"No." Her laughter vibrated against my chest as she nestled closer.

"You didn't wake me when you returned last night."

"I tried. You were out cold." Opening my eyes, I found her gazing at me. The room was still pitch-black; the clock read 4:30 AM.

"What did Raphael want?" She sat up, clutching the blanket to her chest.

"He needs me to handle a situation."

"When do we leave?"

"That's the catch—you're staying here. I go alone."

"W-what?" Her fear spiked like shattered glass.

"I'm sorry, but Raphael was explicit. You stay; I go." There was no way in hell I'd tell her the rest. That horror would never touch her.

###Chapter 0420


"Maybe I could—"

"No." My voice was firm. "You have to stay here. Now that you're awake, the sooner I leave, the better." I moved to sit up, but Victoria's fingers tightened around my wrist.

"Magnus, please! Don't leave me here!" Her voice trembled with raw fear.

"If I had a choice, I'd take you with me. But I don't." I cupped her face, forcing her to meet my gaze. "I love you, Victoria. And I’ll do whatever it takes to keep you safe."

"Then take me!"

Gently prying her hand away, I stood and grabbed clothes from the closet. She followed, hovering in the doorway, her eyes burning with a mix of terror and defiance.

"You need to be brave. Show no weakness here. They’ll test you—see if you’ll lie, question your loyalty. Don’t lie. Stay strong." I pulled on my boots, my voice low. "Where I’m going, you’d be in even more danger. I can’t protect you and do what needs to be done. If you were there, I’d be distracted—worried about you instead of focused on the mission."

"What am I supposed to do here?"

"Stay put unless Raphael orders you out. Enjoy the bed. The hot shower." The way the sheet clung to her curves made my pulse spike, but I shoved the thought aside. I shouldn’t have slept beside her. I should’ve left a note and gone. Now, I was hours behind.

"Can’t you come back to bed and leave at dawn?" Her plea was desperate.

"I shouldn’t have stayed." The truth was sharp. "I should’ve left while you were asleep."

Victoria turned away, frustration tightening her shoulders.



Out loud, I said, "I need to prove to Raphael that I’m still loyal."

Through the mind-link, I added, "This is how I keep you safe. I know leaving you here is cruel, but if it means freedom for us, I’ll do it. Please understand."

"I suppose," she replied silently. "But I hate it."

"Didn’t think you’d like it." Aloud, I continued as if we hadn’t switched. "I’ll check in when I can, but it won’t be often."

"Okay." She climbed back into bed as I finished lacing my boots.

"I’ll find a way to contact you." I pressed a kiss to her forehead.

"How? We don’t have phones." Her eyes were dull with defeat.

"I’ll figure it out." One last kiss, and I walked out, shutting the door softly behind me.

The hallway was silent as I moved toward the castle’s exit. The file was the only thing in my hand. With no clear direction, I headed where I felt most at ease.

There was a small outpost—a place I’d frequented for years. Funded by Alpha Theodore, I’d always been welcome there. The owner liked me enough to keep a cot in the back for long missions. Now that Theodore was dead, I wasn’t sure if I’d still be allowed in. But I’d find out.

The walk took thirty minutes. Moonlight painted the path silver. I’d trekked this route so often, my footprints were etched into the earth. The permanence of it made me smirk. At least I’d left my mark on this world.

The stars above were a comfort. If things were different, maybe Victoria and I could’ve disappeared—started fresh somewhere far from this life. But she wasn’t the type to live rough. She needed stability. Warm meals. A real bed.

###Chapter 421

The night air was crisp as I continued my solitary walk. A few bats flitted overhead, their wings cutting through the silence. The occasional chirp of a cricket broke the stillness, but soon, the birds would wake and take over the dawn chorus.

In the distance, a thin wisp of smoke curled into the sky—my destination. The bar sat on the edge of what most would call a ghost town, though it was anything but abandoned. This place thrived in the shadows, a hub for everything illegal. Dominic had revived it for his underground dealings, cleverly concealed from prying eyes. The closer I got, the more security I spotted. If Old Man Clarence hadn’t noticed me coming, I’d be shocked.

The scent of smoked meat grew stronger, rich and mouthwatering. When I reached the back of the house, the smoker was unattended, flames licking dangerously at the edges.

"What the hell…" I muttered, grabbing my water bottle to douse the fire before it ruined the brisket.

CLICK!

The sound of a gun being cocked echoed like thunder.

"Turn around. Slowly." Clarence’s gravelly voice was unmistakable. The man was short, round, and carried a temper that could rival Raphael’s.

"Just saving your dinner," I said, smirking as I turned to face him.

"I thought you were dead." He didn’t lower the gun, but his eyes narrowed in recognition.

"Surprise."

"What the hell are you doing here?"

"Can we talk inside?" I gestured around us. "Not exactly private out here."

"Like you ever tell me the damn truth," he grumbled, finally lowering the weapon and stomping toward the door.

"Come on, we used to be friends." I tried to lighten the mood, but his scowl only deepened.

"Kiss my ass. Ever since Theodore died, I’ve been bleeding money. You know what that does to a business?" He whirled around, jabbing a finger at me. I slumped into a chair, bracing for the rant. "I had to drain my savings! I should be retired on some damn beach, but no—I’m stuck here, cleaning up after every lowlife scumbag in the territory!"

"It’s not like I’m living the high life either," I admitted. "I’ve been running, doing Lorenzo’s dirty work."

"Lorenzo doesn’t have half the decency Theodore did. Yeah, the man was ruthless, but he respected the people who kept this world running. Lorenzo treats us like garbage. And I’m not lifting a finger to help you if it’s for him."

"It’s not just for him," I said carefully. "I need to get my mate back."

"You found a mate?" His eyebrows shot up. Clarence was a gossip, so I had to tread carefully—but I needed his trust, a place to stay, and maybe even some intel.

"Months ago."

"Where is she?"

"Lorenzo’s got her. I have to prove my loyalty to him. With Theodore gone and Grayson making trouble, I need to secure my place in this mess." I knew Lorenzo would come for me eventually. Might as well get ahead of it.

"There are easier ways to prove yourself than crawling back to him," Clarence scoffed.

###Chapter 422

"True, but none are this cozy or come with such excellent company." I laid on the charm thick, knowing Clarence had a soft spot beneath that gruff exterior. Most assumed he was all business, but deep down, the man craved companionship. Honestly, I believed that was the only reason he stuck around. In this line of work, friendships were a liability.

"What's the job?" Clarence poured himself a steaming cup of coffee and settled across from me.

"Need to track someone down."

"Well, if they're anyone worth knowing, they'll be here tomorrow night for the fight." He took a slow sip, studying me over the rim of his mug.

Damn. Another night away from Victoria. "Guess I'm sticking around for the next two days, then."

"Good. I could use an extra pair of hands. Get downstairs and start sweeping." Clarence pushed to his feet, already walking away.

"Where are you going?" I called after him.

"Back to bed." He disappeared around the corner without another word, leaving me alone.

"Fantastic." Sighing, I headed back outside toward the Den.

From the outside, it looked like nothing more than a dilapidated shed—rusted tin, weathered wood, like a strong gust could flatten it. But inside? Reinforced walls, treated lumber, a hidden staircase leading underground.

It had been years since I’d last attended one of these events. Sometimes fights, sometimes auctions. Once, I’d even witnessed a damn chicken brawl. Anything to make people empty their pockets. But the worst? The women. As one of Theodore’s enforcers, I’d been forced to oversee too many of those transactions.

Flipping on the lights, the fluorescents flickered to life, revealing the bloodstained concrete floor. The space was circular, with built-in bars and viewing platforms. Only one exit—a holding cell on the far side—but the stairs were the sole way in or out. No surprises, no escapes.

Grabbing a broom, I got to work, sweeping away rodent droppings and dead insects. The air filtration system did nothing against nature’s mess.

Funny how criminals would happily break the law but throw a fit if the place wasn’t spotless. After sweeping, I dusted cobwebs and set up tables and chairs.

"Cozy little setup you’ve got here."

Grayson’s voice sent a chill down my spine. For the first time in years, real fear coiled in my gut.

"What are you doing here?" I kept sweeping, refusing to look at him.

"Checking on my investments. I might seem pleasant, Magnus, but there’s a side of me few survive seeing."

Underestimating him would be a fatal mistake. "I’ll ask again—why are you here? This isn’t your scene."

"Just keeping tabs. Did you really think I’d let you walk free without watching your every move?" He leaned against the doorframe, Clarence’s throat gripped in one hand.

"What the hell did you bring to my doorstep?" Clarence snarled, glaring at me.

"Lorenzo gave me a job. I’m proving my loyalty." I stopped sweeping, meeting Grayson’s gaze head-on.

"You look like a cornered animal," he mused.

"What do you want, Grayson?"

"What job did Lornezo give you?"

"To buy back a girl he’s got history with." The lie came easily. No way in hell was I telling him I was after his informant. Victoria’s life depended on my silence.

"Don’t believe you, but remember—I’m always watching." He dragged Clarence forward and tossed him at my feet. "Betray me, and I’ll slaughter everyone you care about." He strode toward the stairs. "Choose wisely, Magnus."

The moment he vanished, Clarence rubbed his throat, glaring. "What kind of mess did you drag into my house?"

"Like I said—proving my loyalty to Lornezo." I exhaled sharply and resumed sweeping.

"You’re in deep, kid." Clarence pulled out a chair, fingerprints already darkening his skin.

"When have I not been? My whole life’s been one wrong move from death. How’s this different?"

"Rumors are spreading about Crimson Fang. Nobody touches them. Hell, they wiped out Theodore’s entire pack. Now they’ve allied with Silvercrest? Untouchable. Most guys here wouldn’t piss on them if they were on fire."

"I’m aware. Barely made it out alive myself." I shot him a look and kept working.

"Damn it, I need a drink." Clarence stormed upstairs.

The second he was gone, I froze.

How the hell had Grayson found me? Had he been tailing me this whole time? Was there a tracker on me? Did I just lead him straight to Ravenstone Keep? If he attacks, Lornezo will assume I betrayed him. Victoria would be the first to die.

Before Clarence returned, I stripped, searching for injection marks—any sign Grayson had planted something while I played dead.
###Chapter 423

The golden hues of sunset painted the sky as I leaned against the railing, lost in thought. The air was thick with anticipation—soon, the place would be swarming with wealthy predators. My mind, however, was elsewhere, consumed by worry for Victoria. I prayed Lorenzo wasn’t hurting her.

"Everything set for tonight?" Nathan’s voice startled me as he approached from behind.

"Yeah. The girls were brought in an hour ago. They’re caged and prepped for the show."

Nathan chuckled, slapping my back. "You look like a lovesick pup."

I scowled. "I’ve never liked these events. Just a bunch of rich bastards measuring their egos. Why not just kidnap human girls if they’re so desperate?"

"Where’s the fun in that?" Nathan grinned as the sound of approaching cars cut through the quiet. "Showtime."

I slipped into the shadows, my role tonight clear—stay unseen, watch for my target, and handle any trouble. The vendors had finished setting up, their stalls gleaming under the dim lighting. Dressed in all black, I blended into the darkness, only my shoes catching the faint glow.

The room quickly filled with murmurs as men in expensive suits took their seats. Some chose to stand, their eyes already hungry. The lights dimmed, leaving only a single spotlight over the stage.

We’d implemented an electronic bidding system to avoid chaos. Each guest had a keypad—bid, raise, or cancel. The girls would stand there for ten minutes, or until the bids stalled.

"Everyone in position?" Cyrus, the auctioneer, strode onto the stage. He was the worst kind of predator—cruel, sadistic. I’d seen him slit a girl’s throat for moving too slowly.

Dressed in a ridiculously expensive suit, his salt-and-pepper hair slicked back with too much gel, he looked like a stick bug playing dress-up.

The spotlight flickered on, and the whispers died. The first girl was led out—Daphne, barely dressed, her skin flawless under the harsh light. Lorenzo’s rule: no bruises before the auction. Better merchandise meant higher bids.

"Daphne, from the fallen Silvercrest Pack," Cyrus announced, shoving her forward. "Raised with discipline, ready to serve her new master."

She stood trembling, blind to the sea of predators watching her.

My gaze swept the room, searching for my target—Mateo Rodriguez. No sign of him yet. But Xavier sat in the corner, as if he belonged here. If Lorenzo was right and Mateo was Grayson’s investigator, he might show. If not, following Xavier could lead me to him.

Our eyes met briefly as I circled the room. He didn’t acknowledge me. We’d agreed to go our separate ways, but our paths were bound to cross again.

Xavier was a cockroach—surviving in every filthy corner of this world.
###Chapter 424

"SOLD!" Cyrus bellowed, swinging the gate open with a metallic screech. He seized the trembling girl by the arm and hauled her back to the holding cell. When he returned, he dragged another captive—this one thrashing violently, her teeth bared in defiance. I recognized her instantly: Bianca, once part of Dominic's inner circle. She fought like a cornered wolf, clawing at Cyrus until he backhanded her hard enough to send her sprawling into the ring. The gate clanged shut before she could lunge again.

"Remember, gentlemen!" Cyrus panted, wiping sweat from his brow. "All purchases must be collected after payment at the end." He forced a grin. "Next up—Bianca. Same pack, but with twice the bite."

The room fell silent, but only briefly. Within minutes, Cyrus shouted "SOLD!" again, and Bianca was yanked away. Either someone had paid a fortune for her, or no one wanted to deal with her fury. Preferences varied.

Then Cyrus brought out the next girl—and the moment she stepped into the dim light, a guttural growl shook the walls.

She cowered behind Cyrus, but it was too late. A massive figure shoved through the crowd, tore her from Cyrus's grip, and sank his teeth into her neck. She went limp instantly, collapsing in his arms. The room erupted—some men roared in outrage, others in twisted delight.

"Don't." I caught the arm of a man surging forward, my grip iron.

"STOP!" Cyrus's voice cut through the chaos. The crowd froze. He glared at the unconscious girl and her new "owner." "You have two choices. Pay 30k now, or I sell her anyway—and you'll feel every scream she makes."

"Fuck you, I'll pay it." The brute shoved Cyrus aside, stormed to Clarence's table, and slammed down a stack of hundreds. Without another word, he vanished into the shadows.

That was when I spotted Mateo Rodriguez.

He sat with three others, a hat pulled low over his face. If not for the flicker of light catching his smirk, I might have missed him entirely.

"Moving on," Cyrus announced, dragging my attention back to the next girl. But I barely registered her. My focus split—one eye on Mateo, the other on the exit.

He played his role perfectly—just another buyer scanning the merchandise. But when I noticed how his gaze tracked Xavier's movements, my blood ran cold. Raphael's intel had been right. Mateo was a ghost—undetectable unless you were watching for him.

Finally, the last girl was paraded out. Clarence expected me to stay and clean up, but he knew I was on a mission. I'd have to find a way to repay him later—especially if Raphael planned to cut him out. Keeping allies happy was crucial. Though if I succeeded tonight, I'd be branded a traitor. There'd be no coming back.

The lights flickered on, and Mateo bolted for the door.

I moved instantly, but the crowd bottlenecked at the exit, slowing me down. The second I broke free, I scanned the shadows—just in time to see Mateo slip into the treeline.

No plan. No strategy. Just instinct.

He was a shadow, and I had everything to prove.

I wove between the trees, silent as death, keeping him in sight. Close enough to strike, far enough to stay hidden. This was my only shot.

Twice, Mateo paused, nostrils flaring as he scented the air.

Good thing I could climb.

As he relieved himself against a tree, I scaled the nearest oak, muscles coiled. A fifteen-foot drop separated us.

Three.

Two.

One.



###Chapter 425
Grayson POV

"You're cutting it dangerously close." Nathan remarked as he stepped into my dressing room.

"I know. I couldn't miss Audrey's luna ceremony, but I should be somewhere else right now. Something big is happening, and I'm not there to handle it." My fingers fumbled with my tie as unease coiled in my gut. To make it back in time for the ceremony, I'd had to leave before whatever was unfolding reached its climax. From the girls they'd brought in, it looked like an auction. Letting it proceed felt wrong, but walking away from Magnus was the hardest part. According to the tracker, he was already back at Ravenstone Keep. My instincts screamed that I was missing something crucial.

"Like what?" Nathan pressed.

"No clue, but I shouldn't be here." I exhaled sharply, grabbing the cologne and spritzing it before studying my reflection.

"Audrey would kill you if she heard that," Nathan warned.

"I won't say it to her. You know that gut feeling when you know you're needed elsewhere? Mine's screaming that I shouldn't have left. I should still be tailing Magnus."

"Did Sebastian come back with you?" Nathan sank into a chair, picking at his nails.

"Yeah. We drove together and left together. Not risking splitting up without backup."

"You might want to fix your face before stepping out there." Nathan stood, adjusting his own tie before eyeing me critically.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

Nathan answered the door. "We came to check on the delay." Sebastian and Oliver strode in.

"Just Grayson psyching himself up," Nathan sighed, stepping aside to let them enter.

"Are the girls ready?" I asked.

"They are. Audrey had a minor meltdown when she realized you weren’t here, but she calmed down after seeing me." Sebastian kept his hands tucked in his pockets.

"Good." I forced the word out, trying to convince myself nothing catastrophic was happening at Ravenstone.

"Nathan… Oliver… get everyone in position. We’ll be down in five." Sebastian’s tone left no room for argument, though it wasn’t unkind.

"Got it." Nathan nodded, understanding the directive. They filed out, shutting the door behind them.

"Still can’t shake the feeling?" Sebastian asked.

"No, and it’s getting worse. Something’s going down there, and we should be in the thick of it." I stalked to the window, clenching my fists to resist the urge to shatter the glass.

"We leave at dawn to head back, but right now, you need to push that aside and be here for Audrey." Sebastian didn’t move toward me.

"I know." Pushing off the wall, I dragged in a steadying breath and locked my emotions down. "Let’s go." I muted the nagging dread and focused on the joy of the moment.

"Better." Sebastian’s frown lingered, but he opened the door. Soft music swelled as we made our way to the stage.

Audrey had insisted on a black-tie theme—more formal than most ceremonies, but she’d gotten exactly what she wanted. The men were in sleek black suits, the women in elegant black gowns. Silver-branched centerpieces erupted from vases filled with glimmering water beads, and stretchy linings draped every table and chair. The setup mirrored Scarlett’s ceremony, likely for ease of transition.

We’d barely taken our positions when the music shifted. The bridesmaids glided down the aisle one by one, taking their seats before the melody changed again. The guests rose, blocking my view until Audrey was halfway to me.

My breath caught.

She was radiant. A faint glow clung to her, nearly buckling my knees. Her fitted lace gown hugged her curves, accentuating the swell of our babies. The off-shoulder sleeves and deep V-neckline framed her perfectly. Curls cascaded to the base of her neck, pinned with delicate rhinestones that made her shimmer.



###Chapter 426

As Audrey approached, I felt the sting of tears threatening to spill. I blinked them back rapidly. While I didn't mind showing vulnerability to my mate, I couldn't afford to appear weak before the gathered alphas and lunas tonight.

Audrey handed her bouquet to Sophia as we met before the ceremonial platform. Extending my hand, I drank in her radiant appearance. "You're absolutely breathtaking," I murmured as we ascended the steps together. Alpha Gregory stood waiting with patient dignity.

"Welcome, pack brothers and sisters!" His voice boomed across the gathering. "Tonight we witness the sacred union of Alpha Grayson and Luna Audrey!" The crowd erupted in cheers, making Audrey's cheeks flush crimson. Alpha Gregory raised his palm, restoring silence. "This couple has chosen to begin with their personal vows. Alpha Grayson, you may proceed."

Taking Audrey's hands in mine, I began. "Audrey, from that first moment our gazes locked and the mate bond snapped into place, I've known I was the most fortunate wolf alive." My thumb traced circles on her knuckles. "Our journey hasn't been peaceful, yet you've adapted with incredible grace. Time and again, you've risen to challenges not just for me, but for both our packs."

I noticed the delicate bracelet I'd crafted for her glinting in the torchlight. "Your enormous heart shapes the future of our kind. You've stood up to me when needed, helping me see perspectives I'd missed." My voice thickened with emotion. "Your belief in me has made me a better leader and man. Soon, I'll strive to be the father our pups deserve. I could never have accomplished half of what I have without you beside me. Coming home to your smile is my greatest reward. Together, we're unstoppable - as partners in leadership and in life. I love you beyond measure."

Tears streamed down Audrey's face as I spoke. Our mate bond thrummed with the love flowing between us. "Luna Audrey, your turn," Alpha Gregory prompted gently.

Audrey took a steadying breath. "Growing up in different circles, I still watched you from afar." Her fingers toyed with the bracelet. "I witnessed every challenge you overcame, each making you stronger. I've always been content to work behind the scenes, needing no recognition beyond seeing others happy."

She placed my hand on her rounded belly where our pups kicked in response. "Becoming your mate thrust me into the spotlight. When I doubted myself, you reminded me not to compare myself to others. 'Define your own legacy,' you said." A tender smile curved her lips. "You've encouraged every dream, giving me strength to grow. Watching you lead inspires me daily to be the best luna - and soon, the best mother - I can be. With you, I fear no challenge. I love you completely."

Alpha Gregory's voice broke the emotional moment. "Repeat after me: I, Alpha Grayson of the Crimson Fang Pack, accept you, Alpha Audrey of the Nightshade Pack, as my mate and luna."

I'd nearly forgotten her official alpha title, though she preferred the luna designation. Squeezing her hands, I repeated firmly, "I, Alpha Grayson of the Crimson Fang Pack, accept Alpha Audrey of the Nightshade Pack as my mate and luna."

Our pups chose that moment to deliver a series of enthusiastic kicks, as if sealing our vows with their approval. The crowd's joyful laughter mingled with our own as we leaned our foreheads together, two hearts beating as one.
###Chapter 427

"Audrey, repeat after me. 'I, Alpha Audrey of the Nightshade Pack, accept Alpha Grayson of Crimson Fang Pack as my mate and Alpha.'"

My voice was steady as I echoed his words. "I, Alpha Audrey of the Nightshade Pack, accept Alpha Grayson of the Crimson Fang Pack as my mate and my Alpha."

Alpha Gregory raised the ceremonial dagger, its silver blade glinting under the soft glow of the chandeliers. "With this blade, you will spill your blood. Combining your essence as one, binding you eternally. The bond between Alpha and Luna is unbreakable. But the bond between two Alphas? That is a force unlike any other. From this moment forward, Alpha Grayson and Alpha Audrey shall stand as the most formidable pair this world has ever seen."

He handed the dagger to Grayson first, then passed me the chalice. Given how far along I was in my pregnancy, we had opted to keep the ceremony simple and stationary. Grayson sliced his palm without hesitation, letting his blood drip into the cup. A cloth was swiftly tied around his wound before it was my turn.

The sting of the blade was sharp but fleeting. My blood mingled with his in the chalice, swirling together like liquid destiny. Grayson drank first, his eyes darkening with the rush of power that followed. When he passed the cup to me, I didn’t hesitate. The moment the metallic tang touched my tongue, warmth exploded through my veins, a surge of raw energy that left me breathless.

Only when we had both steadied ourselves did Alpha Gregory continue. "It is my greatest honor to present to you all—Alpha Grayson and Luna Audrey!"

The room erupted in cheers as we turned to face our pack. Music swelled, shifting from solemn chords to something livelier as we made our way down the aisle. I had vetoed the idea of a formal dinner, so the atmosphere quickly morphed into a full-blown celebration. Servers wove through the crowd with trays of hors d'oeuvres and flutes of champagne—ten different varieties, if I recalled correctly. A tasting table had been set up for the curious, but most guests were already mingling, laughter filling the air.

"Congratulations!" Scarlett barreled into Grayson, nearly knocking him over with the force of her hug before turning to me.

"Thanks, sis," Grayson chuckled, clapping Sebastian on the shoulder.

"Congratulations, Alpha." The soft voice beside me made me turn. Cassandra stood there, elegant in a simple black gown, her dark curls framing her face. A hint of makeup accentuated her features, but her nervous energy was palpable. She dipped into a quick bow before her gaze darted around the room.

"Thank you, Cassandra. It means a lot that you're here tonight."

"I figured I'd start near the exit," she admitted in a whisper. "In case I need to slip out."

"I'm just glad you came at all," I said, slipping effortlessly into my Luna tone.

"Oh, damn." Scarlett suddenly grimaced, pressing a hand to her stomach before looking pleadingly at Sebastian.

"What's wrong?" I asked.

"I didn’t think about how I was going to pee in this outfit," she muttered, gesturing to her sleek silk jumpsuit. Though it flattered her curves, I could tell she was regretting the lack of practicality.

"I'll help you," I laughed. "I need to go anyway—we can figure it out together."

"Goddess bless you," Scarlett sighed in relief.

"Thank the Moon I’ll never have to deal with pregnancy," Nathan muttered as the three of us headed toward the restroom. Cassandra trailed behind us, offering silent support.

"Seconded," Grayson grumbled under his breath.

Then his expression darkened.

"Alpha, we have a problem." A guard’s voice cut through his mind-link.

"What now?" he snapped back.

"There’s a dead body at the front gates."



###Chapter 428

"Take the body to the morgue and leave everything with it. I'll examine it after Luna's ceremony is over," I instructed the guard.

"Grayson?" Audrey's voice reached my ears, soft but insistent. "What's wrong?" Sparks of electricity tingled down my arm. I glanced at my stunning mate, forcing my anger to simmer beneath the surface.

"Nothing that needs immediate attention," I murmured. A slow melody began to play, its rhythm gentle and inviting. Seizing her wrist, I pulled her onto the dance floor. We were the only ones dancing, but I didn’t care. Soon enough, others would join.

"You're not keeping things from me, are you?" Audrey asked, her tone knowing.

"Maybe," I admitted, not wanting to lie but also reluctant to ruin the night. "But do you really want to discuss business tonight?"

"Not particularly," she said, tilting her head. "But if it was important enough to upset you this much, shouldn’t I know?"

"How could I possibly be upset when I have you in my arms?" I tried to distract her with a kiss, but she dodged me playfully.

"Grayson… I thought we were a team." She looped her arms around my neck, fingers interlacing. The swell of her belly kept a small distance between us, but we swayed together effortlessly.

"You really want to know that badly? Can’t we just enjoy tonight and deal with it tomorrow?" I sighed, meeting her gaze.

"I want you to trust me. Don’t hide things because you think they’ll upset me. I want to stand beside you and face whatever comes. Even if I sometimes turn a blind eye to focus on my projects, I still need you to talk to me."

"There’s a lot to tell," I confessed through the mind-link. "Specifically, a body was found outside our territory. I don’t have details yet, but I had a bad feeling about leaving Magnus. We tracked him to a castle and then an auction."

"Why did you leave, then?" Audrey asked.

"I needed to come back to you."

"Oh…" Her expression twisted slightly.

"I wanted to come back. Even if I’d stayed, there’s no guarantee anything would’ve happened. I might’ve just followed him back to the castle. Without reinforcements, it would’ve been too dangerous for Sebastian and me to interfere. I’d have had to watch from a distance—so maybe it was better I wasn’t there."

"You probably would’ve jumped in anyway and gotten hurt," Audrey agreed.

"Exactly. You did me a favor by making sure I came home."

"Who was the man?" she pressed, still using the mind-link. Around us, more couples had joined the dance floor.

"No idea. They just told me they found someone. I’ll check when we get back."

"Do you need to leave now?" she asked as the song ended.

"He won’t be any deader in a few hours."

We returned to the table where everyone was chatting.

"Audrey! If you had to choose between Oliver and Nathan in a footrace, who would win?" Evelyn asked, mischief in her eyes.

"Seriously?" I pulled out a chair for Audrey before taking my own seat.

"Cripple over here thinks he can still beat me," Nathan laughed. Cassandra winced, forcing a smile.

"Without a doubt!" Oliver grinned.

"Have these drinks always been this strong?" Sophia asked, blinking slowly. Oliver shook his head and tugged her closer.

"Aw, my little lightweight."

"Having a baby really messes with your tolerance," Sophia admitted with a shrug.

"Why is this even an argument?" Audrey asked, sipping her water.

"I think you’d win," Sophia hiccuped before setting her glass down.

"Oliver was bragging about running a mile in five minutes," Evelyn said, eyeing Sophia’s drink skeptically.

"That’s impressive!" Audrey smiled.



###Chapter 429

"Not so fast there, champ." Nathan flashed him a pitying grin.

"Fine, challenge accepted." Oliver straightened up with a cocky smirk.

"Challenge? Who said anything about a challenge?" Nathan backtracked instantly.

"I heard it too, and I'm in." Sebastian declared with alpha authority. "We'll organize a one-mile race. Grayson and I will set it up within the next two weeks."

"Scared?" Oliver's gaze taunted Nathan like victory was already his.

"In your dreams, pretty boy." Nathan raised his glass in a defiant toast. Oliver clinked his drink against it, sealing their wager.

"Only at parties do you boys turn into such children," I remarked, shaking my head at their antics.

"Speaking of parties, are you planning a baby shower?" Cassandra inquired.

"Oh yes, eventually. We've got that Halloween bash coming up first," Audrey replied.

"We should do it soon. With triplets, you never know when they'll arrive. Multiples tend to come early," Scarlett added, barely containing her grin.

"I haven't bought anything yet!" Audrey looked suddenly panicked.

"We can go shopping tomorrow and get everything you need," I reassured her.

"That would be perfect!" Audrey exhaled in relief.

"Do you know the genders?" Scarlett leaned forward eagerly.

"We do, but we're keeping it a surprise for now," Audrey said, catching me off guard.

"Aw, really? How am I supposed to know what to buy?"

"She's having three babies. Just buy one of everything—it'll all get used," Nathan quipped between sips.

"He's not wrong. There's plenty of neutral stuff in greens, yellows, and grays!"

"Sure, but what if I want to buy a dress?" Scarlett challenged.

"You'd buy your niece a dress before offering a free tattoo?" Oliver teased.

"They'll get that too."

"Hey, I never got a free tattoo!" I protested.

"Neither did I, and I'm her mate," Sebastian grumbled.

"First, I charged you before we were even mated. After that, what's yours is mine, so tough luck. As for you, Grayson, you always tipped extra because you knew I was saving to travel. But my niece or nephews? They get whatever they want, whenever they want it. Aunt Scarlett doesn't say no."

"We might need to rethink our babysitter options," Audrey stage-whispered—loud enough for everyone to hear.

"Hey!" Scarlett feigned offense as the rest of us burst into laughter.

"We're not raising spoiled brats here," I said firmly.

"Pot, meet kettle," Nathan snorted.

"Don't pretend you didn't enjoy the perks!" Scarlett shot back.

"Let's go streaking!" Sophia suddenly yelled, throwing her arms up.

"...I think it's time we headed home," Oliver said, eyeing her with concern. We all laughed as Sophia swayed to the music alone.

"Is she really that drunk?" Cassandra asked between giggles.

"Absolutely. Haven't seen her like this in ages," Scarlett said, standing. The rest of us followed. "This was a fantastic party. Congratulations!"

"Thank you!" Audrey beamed.

"Would you look at that—a whole party without any drama!" Oliver sighed, hoisting Sophia over his shoulder.

"OOH! Check out this ass!" Sophia grabbed two handfuls of Oliver's backside, making him yelp and swat her away.

"Knock it off!"

"Oh, daddy!" Sophia cackled. Oliver rolled his eyes, flushing crimson as he carried her out.

"Drunk Sophia is my favorite," Scarlett laughed, looping her arm through Sebastian's as we exited. The lights flicked on as staff began dismantling the decorations.

"Just wait a few months, ladies. Then you can all have a wild night out," Sebastian muttered with forced enthusiasm.

"Try to contain your excitement," Audrey deadpanned.


###Chapter 430

"Not happening." Sebastian shook his head as he guided Scarlett toward their car. Oliver stood several yards away, struggling to coax a furious Sophia into his vehicle, while Nathan marched straight to his own. We approached the car Sophia had brought for us to drive home. Opening her door, I waited for her to settle in before sliding into the driver's seat.

"Should I drop you off first, or do you want to come with me to the morgue?" I asked, shifting the car into gear. We were the first to pull out of the parking lot.

"I'll go with you," Audrey replied casually, as if we were just heading out for frozen yogurt.

"You sure?" I pressed.

"Absolutely." She turned her gaze to the window. Reaching over, I laced my fingers through hers as we drove the hour back home. At some point, Audrey's eyelids fluttered shut, though her head never left the headrest. It wasn't until we rolled into the driveway of the pack house that I gently nudged her awake.

"Are we back already?" she murmured, blinking in confusion.

"We are. You fell asleep fast." Stepping out, I circled the car and opened her door for her.

"I haven’t been sleeping well lately."

"Then why didn’t you let me take you straight home?" I asked as we walked inside.

"I won’t sleep any better until this baby arrives." Right. There wasn’t much I could do about that.

"Maybe you need more pillows for support?" I suggested.

"Maybe." She yawned as the morgue door came into view.

"Alpha… Luna," the guard greeted with a bow.

"Were you the one who found him?" I asked as he unlocked the door.

"No, patrol did. I’ve been standing guard until you arrived."

We stepped inside, and the guard moved to the cooler. Pulling open the door, he slid the body out. "Was he like this when he was discovered?"

Audrey inhaled sharply and took a step back. I glanced at her, ensuring she was steady, before turning my attention to the corpse. His face was untouched, but the rest of him was a grotesque patchwork of black and blue—where skin still clung to bone, at least. Chunks of flesh had been brutally torn away, some barely hanging on, others missing entirely.

"Yes. He was naked when we found him, except for this stuffed in his mouth." The guard handed me a phone.

Pressing the side button, the screen lit up, demanding a fingerprint. "Did anyone try to unlock it?"

"No, Alpha." The guard retreated a few steps, watching from a distance.

Grabbing the man’s thumb, I pressed it against the sensor. It took a few attempts, but finally, the phone unlocked. The background was pitch black. The first thing I checked was the messages. No contacts were saved, but I recognized the only number listed—mine.

My blood turned to ice as I read the message. Staring at the corpse, I knew this was no coincidence. Lorenzo had discovered my informant and made an example of him.

"Grayson?" Audrey’s voice pulled me back. She must have sensed the shift in my emotions. "Do you know this man?"

"I do," was all I said as I scoured the phone for any clues. No photos. No emails. No saved contacts. It was as if the device had been wiped clean, except for that single text to my number—the one I’d received right after his call, when I was on my way to track Magnus. Had Magnus been at the auction for this? I’d assumed he was following Xavier, but I hadn’t seen Xavier there. Then again, I’d left early.

This meant Lorenzo was steps ahead of me.

"Who is it?"



###Chapter 431

"Did they find anything else on him?" I demanded, struggling to maintain my composure.

"Nothing. Just the phone."

"I want a full forensic workup—fingerprints, tox screen, everything." I snapped before gripping Audrey's wrist and pulling her out of the morgue.

"Grayson? What's happening?" Audrey pressed as we stepped into the hallway.

"Not here." I growled, steering us through the packhouse and into the car. The moment the doors locked, I yanked out my phone and dialed Sebastian.

Three rings. Then his clipped voice. "This better be urgent."

"My informant was found slaughtered outside our territory tonight."

Dead silence. Then rustling fabric as Scarlett's voice filtered through. "Who is it?"

"Are you certain?" Sebastian ignored her.

"His phone was still on him. Our last messages were open."

"Damn. Lorenzo?"

"That's my guess. No idea how he uncovered him or tracked him here."

"We need to locate his source." Sebastian muttered.

"Sebastian, he was tortured. We have to assume he talked."

"Did he know anything compromising?"

"Minor intel. Just surveillance on Xavier." My grip on the phone tightened.

"Xavier's been a target for years. This changes nothing." Sebastian's voice was steel.

"Damn right."

"Meet me tomorrow. We'll strategize." He exhaled sharply.

"Done." I ended the call.

"That was your informant?" Audrey's voice was barely audible.

"Yeah. He shadowed Xavier. Gave me updates. One of Dad's old assets—how he always stayed ahead."

"Lorenzo... tortured him." Her fingers trembled against her thighs.

"Yes."

"You could've saved him if you'd stayed." A tear streaked down her cheek.

"We don't know that. He could've been taken hours before I arrived."

"What now?" She whispered as I started the engine.

"Sleep. Plan at dawn." My jaw ached from clenching. Rage simmered beneath my skin. Lorenzo had crossed a line, and now I'd play by his rules.

Back home, Audrey trailed me to our bedroom. "Unzip me?" She turned, exposing the delicate clasp.

"Sure." My mind raced through Lorenzo's possible intel. Distracted, I barely registered Audrey peeling off my shirt until her nails grazed my chest.

Her hands worked my belt as mine traced her arms. Sparks flared where she touched, but my thoughts stayed locked on retaliation—until heat engulfed me.

I looked down.

Audrey gazed up, lips wrapped around me.

"Fuck, Audrey." My palm cradled her head as the other braced against the wall. It'd been too long—between her pregnancy and constant threats, exhaustion always won.

Her nails scored my thighs. I locked my knees, fighting the pleasure threatening to buckle them. She didn't relent, dragging her teeth just enough to make me groan.

When I came down her throat, she swallowed every drop.

"Christ." I hauled her up, crushing our mouths together. She melted against me as we tumbled onto the bed. Careful of her belly, I stripped her bare.

"Oh, Grayson!" She arched as my fingers found her slick heat.

"Soaked for me." I nipped the sensitive spot below her ear—the one that made her whimper.

Her hand fisted my length, stroking in time with my thrusts. She writhed beneath me, close—then I pulled away.

"Please!" She begged.

I didn't answer. Just buried my face between her thighs. Her hands fisted the sheets as my tongue lashed her clit. Her legs trembled, heels digging into my back—

###Chapter 432

"Oh! Oh! Oh!" Audrey's cries grew louder with each thrust, her body arching beneath me. Just as she teetered on the edge, I stopped, watching her eyes roll back in frustration. Before she could protest, I drove deep into her, stealing her breath.

Her head snapped back, a scream tearing from her throat as she chanted my name. Every movement sent tremors through her—legs shaking, fingers tangled in her own hair, gaze locked on mine. Her full breasts bounced wildly, nearly choking her with each powerful thrust.

"YES!" Her climax hit hard, triggering mine in unison. I rode out the waves, emptying myself completely before collapsing beside her, chest heaving.

"Thanks," she murmured, lazily patting my hip.

"Thanks?" I laughed, still catching my breath.

"Good job? Solid effort? Pick your praise." She smirked, rolling into my arms.

We dozed off tangled together, but dawn came too soon.

"What time is Sebastian coming?" Audrey mumbled, blinking sleepily as I buttoned my shirt.

"Meeting him at the office. We need a plan after that stunt Lorenzo pulled."

"Got any ideas?"

"Not yet." I leaned down, kissing her. "I'll call you."

"Love you!" she called after me, but I was already halfway down the stairs.

The drive to the packhouse was a blur—either no traffic or I’d broken every speed limit. Either way, no casualties.

"Took you long enough." Sebastian lounged on the porch as I parked.

"How long?"

"Five minutes." He shrugged, following me inside.

"Evelyn had an idea," he said, crossing his arms.

"Let’s hear it."

"Level Ravenstone Keep."

"Excuse me?"

"Reduce it to rubble." He dropped into a chair.

"And the innocents inside?"

"Collateral damage." His indifference made my stomach twist.

"Evelyn suggested that?"

"She said poison. I said bombs."

"Poison still kills bystanders."

"We could infiltrate," he offered.

"How?"

"Use Xavier." His grin was unsettling.

"Let him get captured, release poison inside."

"Or end up like my informant."

"Do we know when their next event is?"

"No. Attacking risks exposing Magnus and Victoria."

"Unless they already know. You did confront Magnus."

"He hasn’t shaken the tracker."

"Flattening it isn’t terrible," Sebastian mused.

"It’s excessive. One innocent death is too many."

"Then we pick them off as they leave. Make Lorenzo’s men vanish."

"Too slow. I want him gutted like he gutted us."

"A sniper, then. Pick them off through windows."

"Now we’re talking."

"I’m a damn good shot," he said, grinning.

"Why wasn’t this Plan A?"

"Because I still want to watch Ravenstone burn."
###Chapter 433

"I've got an alternative plan." Sebastian leaned forward, his fingers steepled together.

"What is it?" My patience was wearing thin, the urge to tear someone apart simmering beneath my skin.

"My team has developed an airborne virus—experimental, but effective. Once inhaled, it prevents blood from clotting, causing internal hemorrhaging. Similar to cobra venom. We'd need to introduce it into Lorenzo's ventilation system. Magnus and Victoria would require the antidote beforehand."

"Why wasn't this the first option?"

"Because it's not foolproof. There's a chance they survive. Their immune systems might resist it."

"Then we shoot whoever's left standing." My tone was cold, detached. Even if it failed, watching them scramble would be satisfying.

"We still need to get the antidote to Magnus and Victoria."

Damn. "What form is it in?"

"A capsule."

I exhaled sharply. Options were limited. "Sneak in and plant it under their pillows?" My voice dripped with sarcasm.

"Or command one of the pack girls to do it." Sebastian's gaze locked onto mine.

"What?"

"Audrey took over that pack. As her mate, you're their Alpha now. If they didn't sever ties when Lorenzo forced them into servitude, they’ll obey you."

"Fantastic. Still need to get close enough to give the order." I pushed off the chair and moved to the window, staring at my own reflection.

"You will. Every move must be precise. One mistake, and you're dead. We can't bring an army."

"A small team, then. Just the elite. They’ll stay close—within firing range, but far enough to avoid detection."

"We can arrange backup. My men are trained." Sebastian’s shrug was visible in the glass.

"Nothing like a little excitement to keep life interesting," I muttered dryly.

"They're still at Ravenstone Keep. We should move before they relocate. Missing them isn’t an option." Sebastian stood, rolling his shoulders.

"Fine." The office door swung open, and Audrey walked in. "How soon can you be ready?"

She shut the door behind her and sank into her chair, fingers already flying across her keyboard. "Give me an hour. I need to prep my team and gear."

"Good. Call me when you're set." I sighed, rubbing my temple.

"Audrey." Sebastian gave her a curt nod before slipping out.

"So, you're leaving again." She didn’t look up, still focused on her screen.

"Yeah. Not sure for how long." I approached her desk and caught sight of what she was browsing—baby furniture.

"We can’t let Lorenzo live." Her sigh was heavy.

"I like the sage green. With cream accents." I pointed at one of the designs.

"Sage?"

"Yeah. Or navy with slate gray." I tapped another option.

"What about for our daughter?"

"Any floral patterns in those colors?"

She typed, and a cascade of designs appeared. "This one." I indicated a delicate blossom motif. "You like it?"

"Actually… I do." Surprise colored her voice. "Thanks."

"We’ll need to repaint the nursery. These shades don’t match." I watched her add items to her cart.

"This is… ridiculously expensive." She winced.

I deliberately avoided looking at the total. "Three babies were never going to be cheap. Get everything we need. Start a registry for the shower."

"True…" She hesitated.

"Just buy it. We don’t have time to shop around." I kissed her cheek and retreated to my desk.

"When do you leave?"

"As soon as Sebastian’s ready. The plan’s shaky, but it’s what we’ve got. The hard part is striking without exposing Magnus and Victoria."

"Just kill Lorenzo. Then it won’t matter." Her tone was distracted.

"That’s the goal."

"Don’t die. I’m not raising triplets alone." Her sharp glare made me glance up from the trackers I was checking.

"I’ll do my best." I smirked, rising. Most of my gear was packed, but I needed extra clothing. Heading to the closet, I yanked out tactical options.

"How long will you be gone?" Her voice was suddenly much closer.

"Not sure. Hopefully just a few days. Depends on how smoothly things go."

"Is it dangerous?" She leaned against the wall, watching me with a mix of amusement and worry.

"Everything’s dangerous. But Sebastian’s coming, and we’re bringing our best. The goal is stealth—minimal risk." I emphasized minimal like it meant something.

"I’ve got too much to handle here. It’s a shame Cassandra can’t work. Even basic tasks are getting difficult."

"Hire an assistant. You know most of the pack. Pick someone you trust."

"I know, but relinquishing control isn’t easy."

"Then hire someone to chauffeur you in a golf cart." My sarcasm was thick.

"Not a bad idea." She actually considered it.

"Glad to help. But you’re carrying three babies. Take it easy—doctor’s orders."

"I’ve got about a month before I’m immobile. What am I supposed to be for the Halloween party?" Her tone was joking, but the question wasn’t.

"Moon Goddess, with your belly as the world. Or Little Red Riding Hood. Or—slice up a doll, glue three sets of limbs to your stomach, and drench it in fake blood."

"Wow. Graphic." She stared at me like I’d sprouted horns.

"The Moon Goddess idea wasn’t bad," I defended.

"It was decent. I’ll think about it."

"Good. This should be all I need. Once I grab a few more things, we’ll head out."

"Just… be careful." Her voice softened.

"I will. I’ll text updates." I kissed her cheek again.

"You’d better."

My phone rang, cutting off her reply.

###Chapter 434

The vehicle of choice this time was a blacked-out van. Sebastian took the wheel while I claimed the passenger seat. Five elite warriors occupied the rear—each uniquely built, from wiry and compact to towering and broad-shouldered. Despite their physical differences, they shared one common trait: lethal precision with sniper rifles and long-range weapons.

Their hand-to-hand combat was formidable, but their knife skills? Absolutely unmatched. With twenty more like them, we could conquer the world. Only Sebastian and I had ever bested them in training, and that was solely due to our Alpha advantage.

Night had fully descended by the time we arrived. Everyone had slept in shifts during the drive, so we headed straight for Ravenstone Keep. The trackers were still active, their signals flickering around the castle grounds. We parked four miles out and hiked three, securing a vantage point on higher ground.

Sebastian and I waited as the team set up. The only sounds were distant owl calls and the rustle of leaves. I grabbed a sniper rifle, dropped to my stomach, and peered through the scope.

The clarity was staggering. Even at this hour, figures patrolled the castle—far too many for comfort. Every window was dark, but we knew better than to assume security was lax. We needed to map every camera and trap, though this time, our scope was wider.

Our secret weapon? Enzo. The smallest of our team, his wolf form was indistinguishable from a natural-born wolf. His movements were so flawless he'd once spent an entire summer undetected in a wild pack. Tonight, he'd infiltrate and scout.

I watched him shift and vanish into the shadows. The only catch? Wolves don’t roam alone. He’d need to join a pack and lead them near the castle. Until then, we gathered intel.

Pulling out my phone, I shot Audrey a text: Made it. Powering off. Love you. I switched it off and stashed it, refocusing on the mission.

Sebastian unfolded a map from our last recon, marked with Gunther’s movements. Tracking him had been easy—almost too easy. He’d glanced back a few times, but never spotted us.

"How many guards?" Sebastian crouched beside me.

I scanned the perimeter. "At least five. One at the main entrance, one on each corner, plus roving patrols."

"Two sets of eyes on every sector at all times," Sebastian muttered.

"Exactly." Then the front doors swung open. My breath hitched. "Holy hell."

"What?"

"Raphael’s at the entrance. Hand me a round." I kept the crosshairs locked on him as Sebastian passed me a bullet. Breaking focus to load the rifle was agonizing. One clean shot, and we could end this.

I chambered the round and looked back—but he was gone. "Do you see him?"

"Lost him." My pulse roared in my ears. Steadying my breath, I forced calm. A shaky hand meant a missed shot.

Then chaos erupted. Guards sprinted urgently. "Something’s wrong," I muttered. More of our team dropped beside me, rifles ready.

Sebastian grabbed one and peered through his scope. The doors flew open again—Magnus stormed out, furious, barking orders we couldn’t hear.

"Anyone read lips?" Sebastian asked.

"Too far," someone answered.

Then a shout: "East side!"

We pivoted. Three men dragged a fourth toward the courtyard. Then three more. Four prisoners now knelt before Magnus and—presumably—Raphael, obscured by trees.

"Grayson, where’s Xavier on the tracker?" Sebastian demanded.

"I’ll kill him myself," I growled, yanking my phone from my bag and powering it on.

The prisoners were beaten but alive—until a gunshot cracked. I froze.

Another shot. Through the scope, I saw the second man collapse, his body slumping beside the first.

"Grayson—" Sebastian’s voice was tight.

My screen lit up. I pulled up the tracker—just as a third shot rang out.

"Motherf—"

###Chapter 435

"Damn it, what the hell are we going to do?" I growled under my breath.

"Hold on," Sebastian murmured, his voice tense.

"What's happening?" I dropped low, pressing my body against the damp earth as I peered through the scope. The men stood abruptly, and the guards ushered them inside Ravenstone Keep before Lorenzo and Magnus followed, the heavy doors slamming shut behind them. The remaining guards resumed their patrols, their movements mechanical.

"They're inside."

"Shit. They'll torture him like they did my informant." My grip tightened around the rifle.

"Grayson, you can't let that happen," Sebastian exhaled sharply.

"Fuck. Fuck. Okay, here's the plan—I'm moving in now. I'll find a way inside. You and the others need to cover me. Watch every angle of this damn fortress. I'll plant the pills and find that bastard."

"Grayson, you're going in blind," Sebastian hissed, his disapproval radiating even in the dark.

"You got a better idea? Want to take my place?" I dug through my pack, pulling out knives, lockpicks, and anything else that might help me survive.

"You heard him," Sebastian barked into his comm. "I want eyes on every side of the keep. Not a single blind spot."

The men moved without hesitation, dispersing into the shadows.

"Sebastian… if something happens to me—"

"Don't." His voice was sharp. "Don't even say it."

"I'm serious. This is the most dangerous thing I've ever done. If I don't make it back—" My throat tightened at the thought of never seeing Audrey or the kids again.

"I'll take care of her," Sebastian said firmly, gripping my shoulder. "Just focus on getting out alive."

He handed me my earpiece. We waited in tense silence until the team confirmed their positions.

"Listen up," Sebastian commanded. "No mistakes. Your training ends here. Alpha Grayson's life is in your hands—don't screw this up."

He gave me a nod.

Time to move.

I had a short distance before hitting the first security perimeter. Keeping low, I hugged the tree line, forcing Audrey from my mind. I needed control—steady heart, steady mind.

"Approaching thermal cameras. Slow down," a voice crackled in my ear.

I obeyed, my steps silent as I shifted behind a thick oak.

"Stop!" The command was urgent. I froze. "Thermal scan to your right. Wait for my signal, then move north."

I slipped around the trunk, scanning the darkness. Even with enhanced vision, I couldn’t spot the cameras.

"Camera west. Stay east," another voice warned.

"Now!"

I lunged for the next tree, pressing against its eastern side. My breath was slow, controlled.

Silence. No warnings.

I moved tree by tree, the tension gnawing at me. Were they still there? Every pause made me expect an ambush—a shout, a gunshot. But nothing came.

"Thermal on your right. Hold."

I flattened against the bark.

"Now!"

I darted forward.

"Watch your step—possible tripwires."

Crouching, I squinted at the forest floor. Moonlight caught faint glimmers of wire. I stepped carefully, clearing each one.

Still over a mile to go. At this rate, dawn would break before I reached the keep.

But I made it.

The guards were sluggish, heads lolling as they fought sleep.

"You’ve got a five-second window," came the whisper in my ear. "Leap from this tree to the bush beneath the window. Thermals are on the trees, guards are scanning. Tuck and roll—stay low."

Understood. Time for some spy-level bullshit.

I waited. And waited. The guards rotated, their patterns erratic.

"On my mark… three… two… one… GO!"

I launched forward, eyes locked on the bush. The dive was smooth, but staying still in the thorny foliage was agony.

I didn’t breathe. Didn’t move.

Had they seen me?
###Chapter 436

The footsteps faded into the distance, and I finally allowed my body to relax. A wave of relief washed over me, though I knew the danger wasn’t over. One obstacle at a time—that was the key. Relying so heavily on our team was nerve-wracking, but there was no other choice.

"Undetected. Hold position," came the hushed voice in my earpiece.

I shifted beneath the dense foliage, adjusting my stance so I could move quickly if needed. My legs tensed, ready to spring into action. Over and over, I repeated the mantra in my head—Stay calm. Steady breaths. Don’t let the adrenaline take control. The urge to burst out and fight was overwhelming, but reckless moves would get me killed. Slow and steady.

"Ten seconds. Check the window."

I glanced up. The window wasn’t high—maybe five feet off the ground—but getting there unnoticed would be tricky. Timing was everything.

"Now!"

I sprang up, fingers gripping the window frame. It slid open easily—too easily. My stomach dropped as I spotted the thin red beam of a motion sensor. Shit. I slammed it shut and dropped back into the bushes just as shouts erupted around me.

"BREACH!"

Boots pounded against the earth as guards swarmed the area. I pressed myself flat against the castle wall, heart hammering.

"Thermal picked up movement at the window!" someone barked in my earpiece.

Sebastian’s voice cut through the chaos. "What’s inside that room?"

"Storage. Shelves, boxes—nothing stable."

"So, a damn noise trap," he muttered.

"Options are slim. Either risk it, find another entry, or walk through the front door like we own the place."

A second voice chimed in. "There’s a cellar door in the back, but no visibility inside."

"Too risky," Sebastian snapped. "Could be prisoners, traps—who the hell knows?"

A beat of silence. Then—

"Grayson, you’ve got fifteen seconds. Open the window, assess, and decide. If it’s too hot, bail and wait for the next opening."

I swallowed hard. No room for hesitation.

"Five… four… three… two… NOW!"

I lunged for the window again, shoving it open. The sensor blinked ominously. No choice. I slammed it shut and bolted along the castle wall, keeping low.

"FALSE ALARM!" a guard shouted as I slipped beneath the front stairs, pressing into a narrow crawl space.

Dirt coated my hands as I smoothed the disturbed earth behind me. Footsteps thundered past, flashlights sweeping the bushes.

"Grayson, status!" Sebastian’s voice was sharp in my ear.

"Stairs," I breathed.

"Front door’s unguarded. Most are searching the window. If you move now, you can slip inside."

I didn’t think—just moved.

The crawl space ended at a wooden barrier, nailed shut. Fantastic. Teeth gritted, I shoved against it, feeling the nails groan in protest. Inch by inch, it gave way. The thick bushes shielded me as I wriggled free, then carefully repositioned the wood to avoid suspicion.

"Ready," I whispered.

"Hold… hold… NOW!"

I burst from cover, sprinting up the front steps. The door swung open silently, and I slipped inside, pressing myself against the wall.

The grand foyer was exactly what you’d expect from a castle—high ceilings, marble floors, a massive chandelier dripping with crystals. To my left, a door stood slightly ajar. I darted toward it, praying for cover.

A broom closet. Better than nothing.

The front door creaked open.

"You idiots tracking mud everywhere!" Lorenzo’s voice boomed through the hall. "This is the second time tonight! Clean it up!"

His footsteps faded, but my pulse skyrocketed as I stared at the broom inches from my face.

The closet door flew open.

"Fucking morons," a guard muttered, snatching the broom before slamming the door shut again.

I exhaled shakily, then froze.

My boots were caked in dirt.

If I was going to survive this, I needed to disappear—starting with the evidence.
###Chapter 437

I yanked off my boots with ease, letting them drop to the floor. The vest was trickier—I needed it, but it was covered in grime. Instead of removing it, I shook out the dust, watching it scatter across the hardwood. By the time anyone noticed the mess, I’d be long gone.

"YEAH! Hell yeah!" The door swung open, and I froze. The foyer light spilled in, illuminating my hands mid-motion. "Kiss my ass," a man muttered as he tossed a broom inside. He didn’t even glance my way before slamming the door shut again.

"Status update?" Sebastian’s voice crackled in my earpiece.

I stayed silent, finishing my quick cleanup while listening for movement. Dawn was creeping closer, shrinking my window of opportunity. When I was certain the coast was clear, I finally responded.

"Closet off the foyer. Moving soon."

"Holy shit. You’re alive." Relief dripped from the voice on the other end.

"Any intel on where I’m headed?" My fingers curled around the doorknob.

"None. Dungeons are the obvious guess for prisoners, but Magnus needs that antidote first."

"Be ready," I warned before cutting the comms.

I twisted the knob and peered into the lobby. No guards in sight. If they’d stashed Magnus and Victoria in a guest room, I just had to find the right door.

"Assume every room has cameras," Sebastian’s voice returned, urgent. "Your vest has a laser—point it at any lens, and the feed will glitch. They’ll think it’s a bug. Stay in the shadows. Move carefully."

No pressure. Just become a ghost.

The first door revealed an empty bed. I barely cracked it before shutting it again. The next—another vacant room. Bathroom. Closet. Four bedrooms. Nothing.

Kitchens and living areas were usually downstairs, bedrooms above. I took the stairs slowly, my socks silent against the wood. No shoe prints to betray me.

"Why’s he pushing for tonight?" A door creaked below. I bolted up three steps, melting into the shadows. My breath stilled. "They’re not going anywhere."

"No clue. Last guy he carved up didn’t talk. Pissed him off bad." My pulse spiked. My informant had stayed silent.

"Yeah, but this one’s a damn cockroach. Won’t matter if he talks—he’s not walking out." Their voices faded.

Xavier was getting questioned tonight. That meant I had to find Magnus—fast.

I moved quicker, checking rooms. A few had sleeping figures, but none were the right scent. Then, in the next hallway, a glint caught my eye—a sparkling shoe peeking from under a bedspread. Too fancy for staff. Victoria.

I slipped inside, shutting the door silently. The weight of unseen eyes pressed on me, but I spotted no cameras. Still, they were there.

"Please…" Victoria whimpered in her sleep, tossing. Sweat glistened on her forehead, a fresh split in her lip purpling.

"Hurry. Wake him. Pills first, then get out. Movement’s picking up outside," the earpiece hissed.

I moved to Magnus’s side, clamping a hand over his mouth. His eyes flew open, body tensing to strike. I dodged his swing, flooding the space with my aura until recognition flickered in his gaze.

"The hell—?"

"Take these." I shoved the pills into his palm. "Give some to Victoria."

He stared at the pills, then at her. "Why?" His whisper was barely audible. "This place is wired."

"Take them or die." Simple.

I turned, cracked the door, and slipped out.

"Dungeons. Back of the house. Heavy activity," a voice warned in my ear.

"Eyes are limited. Move carefully," another added.

All I could think was—was Enzo making progress? I might need a distraction soon.

Hugging the wall, I navigated the hall, avoiding patrols. Then I rounded a corner—and collided with a guard.

For one heartbeat, we stared.

Then reality crashed in.

I was screwed.
###Chapter 438

Before either of us could react, crimson sprayed across the wall. His body went limp, collapsing against me. A single bullet hole marred the windowpane.

Panic clawed at my throat until I spotted the door beside me. Balancing his dead weight, I shouldered it open—a bathroom. I flicked on the fan, twisted the lock, and shut it behind me, masking the scene as merely occupied.

"Clean the blood," a voice hissed in my earpiece.

"Then stop putting fucking bullets through their skulls!" I snapped, snatching a towel. After dampening it, I peeked out. The hallway was clear. Swiftly, I wiped the spatter, tossed the soiled towel inside, and secured the door.

Following the distant clamor, I reached the stairwell and froze. "No visual on the lower level," came the warning. The window beside me offered a sliver of outside light. Beyond that door lay the unknown.

"Sebastian?" I breathed.

"Still no contact," Nathan answered.

"I need a diversion."

"Already on it," another voice chimed, too eager.

"Sebastian, remember our talk—" My gaze fixed on a shadowed figure outside. Wishful thinking made me believe it was him.

"You can tell her yourself when you get back," Sebastian replied, voice thick.

Nodding, I gripped the handle. One steadying breath later, I slipped inside. Darkness swallowed me whole. The wet smack of fists meeting flesh echoed down the corridor. How the hell was I getting Xavier out alive?

A door creaked open to my left—another damn storage closet, reeking of bleach and bloodied rags. Ours were never this cramped.

"Trigger another alarm. Draw them outside so I can move."

"Are you insane? That’ll bring Lorenzo running!" a voice crackled in protest.

"Or I carve through every guard here and blow our cover. Pick your poison."

"Grayson—" Sebastian started.

"Do it."

Silence. Then, two minutes later, alarms wailed.

"WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH THESE SYSTEMS? WHERE’S PATRICK?" Lorenzo’s roar preceded his stomping footsteps, a herd of men trailing him.

A full minute of stillness passed before I deemed it safe. Knife in hand, I crept toward a lit room with its door ajar.

"Go to hell," Xavier rasped.

"You’re the one dying today," a guard sneered.

Peering inside, Xavier sat bound to a chair, torso carved with jagged symbols, face a mask of blood. The guard’s back was turned.

No hesitation. I lunged.

He whirled just as my blade found his throat. A sharp twist silenced him permanently. His body hit the floor with a wet thud.

"Grayson?" Xavier blinked, dazed.

"Know the exit?" I sawed through his ropes. He slumped forward. "Nathan, now would be fantastic for Enzo to appear."

"Christ—that hurts!" Xavier groaned as I hauled him up.

"Move or we both die." The threat worked—he found his footing.

"Lucky break," Nathan exhaled.

Draping Xavier’s arm over my shoulders, I dragged him toward the rear exit.

"Back door’s clear," I reported.

"Hold," Nathan ordered. My pulse hammered. "Now! Woods—go!"

I shoved Xavier outside. We sprinted for the tree line, where a russet wolf waited. Enzo lowered himself, and I heaved Xavier onto his back.

"Get him to base. I’m running."

As we bolted, the pack’s diversion sent alarms into chaos. "Did the AC toxin deploy?" I panted.

"Enzo handled it. That’s why we stalled," Nathan confirmed.

"Pick them off," Sebastian commanded.

Thirty seconds later, screams erupted.

"FALL BACK!"

By base camp, the shouts had ceased—their defenses now self-destructing.

"Did we get Lorenzo?" I begged the Moon Goddess for confirmation.

###Chapter 439

"No. From what I saw, he never made it out," Sebastian said as he took another shot.

"How did you track us down?" Xavier's voice was strained with pain. His breathing came in ragged gasps, sweat glistening on his forehead.

Ignoring him, I snatched the binoculars and scanned the area. Men staggered out of Ravenstone Keep, blood streaming from their eyes, noses, and mouths. "This is working better than expected," I muttered, a flicker of hope igniting in my chest.

"Magnus and Victoria are bleeding but not coughing like the others," Sebastian reported.

"Keep eyes on Lorenzo. He fled into the woods with a group. Lost visual."

"Are you going after him?" Xavier demanded.

"Magnus and Victoria already took off in pursuit," one of our men answered.

Sebastian locked eyes with me. "Hold position. Finish the job here." I closed my eyes, listening to the sharp cracks of Sebastian's rifle before he finally sat back. "It was the right call."

"You let him escape," Xavier spat, bitterness lacing his words.

"Why the hell are you even here?" I rounded on him, barely containing my fury. "We had a solid plan, and you blew it to pieces! Why can't you just stay in the shadows and not get caught?" My voice rose despite my efforts to stay controlled.

"I had intel. Didn’t expect Lorenzo’s men to be there." Xavier refused to meet my gaze.

"Intel on what?"

"There were girls being sold—former maids of Lorenzo’s. Thought they might know something about his operations."

"Pack it up. We’re leaving," Sebastian ordered his men.

"When’s the next auction?" I pressed Xavier.

"Not for weeks. After this, they might go underground. This was a massive blow to Lorenzo. He won’t forget it. Just cost him his reputation." His eyes burned into mine, deadly serious.

"He shouldn’t have the manpower to retaliate yet. This took him months to build," Sebastian added.

"Don’t get comfortable. He has allies. They might rally to strike your packs," Xavier warned, as if we weren’t taking him seriously.

"With our numbers, you think they’d risk it?" I scoffed.

"You pissed off a lot of Alphas by killing Damian. They might side with Lorenzo to take you down, then turn on him after. Nobody likes Lorenzo, but they hate you more."

"The enemy of my enemy is my friend," Sebastian muttered, packing his gear.

"Exactly."

"Good. Let them come. I’m done sneaking around. If they want a fight, bring it on." My patience was gone. I wanted this over.

"Only a few made it into the woods," one of our men reported as the others returned.

I pulled out my phone, checking the tracker. The targets were still moving east, running as if chased. Xavier was too distracted watching the others pack to notice. Still, I locked the screen and pocketed it. My bare feet ached from the cold ground, but there was no helping it now.

"Where are your shoes, Alpha Grayson?" Enzo asked, shifting back to human form.

"Had to ditch them. Didn’t want to leave tracks."

"I can shift back if you—"

"I can shift too if needed. Thanks." Sighing, I grabbed my gear and headed toward the car.

"Little help here!" Xavier barked.

Still irritated, I yanked him up by the arm. "Better?" He winced but kept moving, scowling.

"How many lives do you have left, Xavier?" Sebastian asked, falling into step beside us—probably to make sure I didn’t kill him myself.

"A few more. I’m not done yet." Xavier’s wounds had reopened, blood seeping through his clothes. My sympathy was nonexistent.

"Shut up, Xavier. If you’d just killed Damian when Vivienne found him, none of this would’ve happened. Did you even try over the years?" I knew I was projecting, but that didn’t make me wrong.

Silence followed as we reached the vehicle. I shoved Xavier into the back before climbing in. Dawn was breaking, exhaustion weighing on us all. Still, I forced myself to stay awake alongside Sebastian. The others were already passed out.

Their snoring was louder than any music we could’ve played—completely out of sync, one starting just as another tapered off. It was unbearable the entire ride.

"You should sleep," Sebastian sighed.

"I’m fine."

"Where are they?" We were only a few hours from home now.

"Still moving east through the woods."

"If they don’t double back, Lorenzo might not realize it was us until later." Sebastian sounded hopeful.

"That’d take more luck than I’ve got." It’d be nice if Lorenzo blamed Xavier, but I doubted he was that stupid.

"Yeah. Assume he knows."

"We should level Ravenstone Keep. Wipe any evidence. Everyone there is dead—time to erase it."

"Agreed. Might buy us time. They could think it was someone Lorenzo crossed in a deal."

"The real question is—will he call in his allies? And how much backup can he actually get?"
###Chapter 440

"Grayson, you've been glued to that screen for two weeks straight." Audrey rested her hands on my shoulders. It had been fourteen days since we visited Lorenzo. Fourteen days of my eyes burning from staring at the tracking screen. Magnus and Victoria hadn't moved from their hideout—an abandoned cabin deep in the woods. Not once.

We had no way of knowing if Lorenzo was coming and going. Unless we showed up unannounced, we had to pretend we had no clue where they were. Just showing up at Ravenstone Keep had already been risky enough.

"I know." I rubbed my tired eyes. "I'm not sure what I'm looking for, but I can't look away."

"Any updates on the auction rumors?" Audrey waddled to the sofa and sank into the cushions with a sigh. Her belly had grown noticeably rounder—already looking like a full-term pregnancy, even though she was only halfway through. Still, she never complained. Her blood pressure had stayed stable, so she refused to slow down. But by evening, her ankles swelled like overstuffed pillows.

"Whispers, nothing concrete. Xavier claims he's healed and ready to go back out there." I exhaled sharply and turned off the tracker. "At this point, I don’t think it’s a good idea. He’s burned through most of his second chances. I might not be around to save him a third time."

"You won’t stop him either way." Audrey rubbed her belly absentmindedly.

"The Halloween party’s coming up. Are we ready?" I changed the subject before we spiraled into another debate about Xavier’s recklessness.

"Absolutely. The food’s ordered, and the decorations arrived yesterday." Her face brightened instantly.

"Decided on a costume yet?"

"I’m thinking Moon Goddess. Simple, comfortable, and easy to throw together."

"Good."

"What about you?" She arched a brow at me.

"Do you have something in mind?" I studied her expression, already sensing a trap.

"Father Time."

I grimaced. Not exactly my style, but I wasn’t about to argue. "Sure, if that’s what you want."

"You don’t have to." She pouted.

"I just draw the line at the beard." If I remembered right, Father Time had a ridiculously long gray beard and robes. The robes were fine. Even the giant clock necklace. But the beard? No.

Audrey burst out laughing just as Sebastian walked in.

"Did I interrupt something?" He smirked at her.

We hadn’t told Audrey the full extent of the danger I’d been in. She knew the basics—just not how close I’d come to disaster. And what I’d asked of Sebastian? That secret would stay buried.

"Nope. Grayson’s protesting the beard for his costume."

Sebastian shot me a look. "Would you want to wear one?" I shot back defensively.

"Damn. Scarlett wants to go as a disco ball and has me in full '70s gear. Afro included."

"Suddenly, the beard doesn’t sound so bad." I smirked.

"I vetoed the afro. The rest is fine." He dropped into a chair with a sigh.

"Bet she already bought the costume and 'forgot' to mention it." I air-quoted the last word. Sebastian nodded grimly.

"We just wanted to make sure you two had options," Audrey chimed in, struggling to stand. Sebastian jumped up before I could and helped her. "Thanks."

"Where are you off to?" I asked.

"To lie down. The Chinese food is making me swell like a balloon." She sighed. "I’m heading home. You two can talk shop without me."

"Need a ride?"

"I’ve got the golf cart. Hopefully, that belly support band I ordered arrived." She shuffled toward the door.

"Text me when you’re home." I watched her go, my chest tight. It was bittersweet—watching her body change daily, the swelling, the exhaustion. But she never complained. And despite it all, she was radiant. As long as her blood pressure stayed stable, we’d make it through.

"Will do! Bye!" She waved and shut the door behind her.

"She looks miserable," Sebastian muttered once she was out of earshot.

"How’s Scarlett?" I deflected.

"Loving pregnancy. Aside from missing cocktails, she’s thriving—loves showing off her bump. Shop’s doing great too." He tossed a folder onto my desk.

"What’s this?"

"More whispers about an upcoming event. They’re not selling girls this time. No idea what it is, but word is all the major players will be there."

"If Lorenzo wants to test loyalties, he’ll show." I drummed my fingers on the desk.

"We’ve got two ways to play this."

###Chapter 441

"Oh?" I arched a brow, waiting for Sebastian to continue.

"Crash the party and make it clear you have eyes and ears everywhere—even without your informant..."

"Or?"

"Or stay hidden and listen. But I did dig up something interesting." A sly glint flashed in Sebastian's eyes.

"What?" I narrowed my gaze, instantly suspicious.

"That old man living there? He despises Raphael. Theodore funded his operation, so the old man turned a blind eye and did favors for him. But since Theodore was killed, Raphael hasn’t paid him a dime. Might be worth paying him a visit with a generous offer."

"That’s... an idea." I mulled it over before speaking again. "Or he could take our money and stab us in the back. Feed us lies."

"True." Sebastian nodded. "He’s spent his life knee-deep in illegal dealings. But..." He leaned forward, lowering his voice. "He could also hand us everything we’re missing."

I exhaled sharply. "If we approach him, we lose the element of surprise. Our cover’s blown."

"Worse," I added, "if he agrees to help and then betrays us at the event? There’s no exit strategy. We’re dead." My fingers tapped restlessly against the armrest. "I got a good look at that place when I confronted Magnus. And let’s just say, he wasn’t exactly thrilled with me."

"Money changes people." Sebastian’s tone was matter-of-fact.

He wasn’t wrong. Money twisted loyalties, reshaped motives.

"We can’t send Xavier in, and Magnus and Victoria are holed up in that cabin. We’re running out of options, but I want to hear what he has to say."

Sebastian nodded. "Then that’s our next move. See what Magnus thinks. You said he stayed at the old man’s place. Maybe he can gauge whether the guy would cooperate."

"We’d need to confirm Raphael isn’t watching."

"We could send the pack. Enzo’s been with them for days. No family ties—perfect for undercover work if we need intel."

I blinked. "You sent Enzo to live with them?"

Sebastian smirked. "He can deliver a message or figure out how to communicate with Magnus."

"Unless Raphael recognizes him."

"That assumes Raphael has the manpower to do anything about it."

"They fled to that cabin without hesitation. Other than our helicopter surveillance, we’re blind. Who knows what security he’s got." Sebastian sounded uncertain.

I sighed. "Evelyn wants to come over for dinner. Since Audrey isn’t cooking, she’s bringing food."

"Everything okay?"

"Yeah." Sebastian shrugged. "Think she just misses you. You’ve been so wrapped up in everything, she’s feeling the distance."

"Aw, her heart’s showing." I chuckled.

"She’s been emotional lately. But she also has something to discuss with you."

"Emotional like Sophia?"

"God, no. Nothing like that."

"What does she want to talk about?" Unease prickled at the back of my neck.

"Not my place to say. Just delivering the message." Sebastian stood, smirking. "I’ll tell her it’s done. See you at six."

"Fine."

After he left, I headed home to break the news to Audrey. The packhouse buzzed with activity, warriors on high alert since the attack on Raphael. But so far, silence.

Pulling into the driveway, I exhaled. This house—raising my kids here—meant everything.

"Audrey?" I called, stepping inside.

"Kitchen!"

I found her rummaging through the fridge, pickle jar in hand. She popped one into her mouth without glancing at me.

"Planning supper?"

"Trying to." She shut the fridge with a sigh.

"Evelyn’s bringing dinner. She has something to discuss."

"Oh?" Audrey turned, frowning. "Any idea what?"

"I think I know," she murmured, sinking onto the couch.

"What?"



###Chapter 442

The golden afternoon sunlight streamed through the windows as I settled onto the couch. "I'm guessing the Halloween party," I said, glancing at Audrey. "We've been discussing costumes and food all week."

Sebastian mentioned Scarlett wanted them to dress as a disco ball and a 70s person. I studied Audrey's face, waiting for her reaction.

She threw her head back with a laugh. "I love that idea. Definitely one of the better ones she’s come up with."

"What other options did she suggest?" I asked, curious.

"Either she was going to be the volleyball from Castaway and make him Tom Hanks, or dress as Juno."

I shook my head in disbelief. "Those are terrible."

We moved back to the living room, where Audrey had claimed the recliner as her throne. Pillows lined every edge, snacks were neatly arranged on the side table, and her laptop sat within easy reach.

"The Moon Goddess was funny?" I asked, flipping on the TV.

"Better than the gumball machine she tried to convince me to be," Audrey muttered, pulling a blanket over herself as Friends started playing. By the next commercial break, she was already asleep.

Not wanting to waste time, I tidied the living room, washed the dishes, and switched out the laundry. Spotting cleaning supplies nearby, I tackled the bathrooms too. Just as I finished folding the last blanket, the doorbell rang.

"What?" Audrey jolted awake, blinking in confusion.

"Looks like Sebastian and Scarlett are here," I said, stifling a laugh as I opened the door.

"Hey!" Scarlett beamed as she walked in. Sebastian followed, arms loaded with bags, heading straight for the kitchen.

"Oh no! I was going to clean before you arrived," Audrey groaned.

"Already took care of it," I said, joining Sebastian in the kitchen.

"You're welcome to come clean my place next," Scarlett teased as the girls filed in.

"The builders finished installing the cabinets and everything. Our house is basically a dust magnet now," Sebastian said, unpacking the food. He handed salads to the girls while he and I got steaks.

"I can’t wait to see it!" Audrey’s eyes sparkled with excitement. "I’m surprised you managed it all yourself. Usually, I have to handle everything for you."

"Hey!" Scarlett feigned offense. I choked on my beer mid-sip, liquid shooting out my nose and making my eyes water.

"She’s not wrong," I chuckled, wiping my face.

"If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t have made it past fifteen," Audrey said, stabbing her salad with a fork.

"Should’ve left you at the orphanage," Scarlett grumbled. "I did some things!"

"You did. You gave me info, and I organized, planned, submitted, and followed up on everything." Audrey shot her a challenging look.

"Whatever. I was running my own business."

"Speaking of which," I cut in, "I’ll need a tattoo after the babies are born."

Scarlett perked up. "What are you thinking?"

"Maybe their footprints down my arm or something."

"With triplets, that’d be adorable," she agreed.

"Yeah, that’s the goal—adorable," I deadpanned, finishing my beer and digging into my food.

After a comfortable silence, Audrey spoke up. "Sebastian mentioned you had something to discuss?"

"Yeah, so… we found out we’re having a girl," he said.

Audrey’s face lit up. "That’s amazing!"

"Thanks. We wanted a few kids, so Sebastian gets another shot at a boy."

"Hey! Girls are just as capable as boys," Audrey pointed her fork at him.

"I know that. But I won’t raise my daughter like Evelyn was raised. If she wants to fight, fine. If she wants to be pampered, that’s fine too."

Part of me bristled at that, but I understood. Scarlett hadn’t had choices growing up. He wanted his daughter to have the freedom she never did.

"So, what’s the question?" I asked.

"We’ve been discussing names," Sebastian said. "We’re thinking of naming her Adalynn."

That caught me off guard. We’d tossed around names but never seriously. I took another bite, watching Scarlett. Sebastian and Audrey stayed quiet, observing us. Scarlett fidgeted nervously.

"Why are you so nervous?" I finally asked.

"I’m not!" She rolled her eyes, avoiding my gaze.

"It’s written all over your face."

She sighed. "I just didn’t know if you’d want your daughter named after our mother."

"I haven’t given it much thought. Been a little busy."

"Well, you should. The babies will be here soon, and with three, you need to be ready," Scarlett said pointedly.

"I’m making sure the world is safe and their mother isn’t in danger," I shot back.

"We’ve only thrown names around," Audrey interjected, easing the tension. "Nothing serious yet."

"Scarlett, if you want to name her Adalynn, I’m fine with it," I said neutrally.

"Are you sure? We can pick something else."

"I’m sure. Adalynn what?"

"Adalynn Grace."
###Chapter 443

"That's actually perfect." Audrey beamed, her eyes sparkling with excitement.

"It was just an idea. We haven't settled on anything yet, but I wanted to run it by you first." Scarlett kept her gaze locked on me, searching for any reaction.

"Call her whatever you want—I'll be spoiling her either way, so it doesn't matter." I forced a casual tone, but a tiny, nagging voice in the back of my mind whispered that it did bother me. I wasn’t sure why. We hadn’t even officially discussed names yet—just tossed around a few ideas once.

Pushing back from the table, I grabbed two more beers and slid one toward Sebastian. After cracking mine open, I took a long swig, grateful when Audrey smoothly changed the subject. "I picked up some fabric today for the goddess dress. I’ll need your help designing it."

"Oh! I’d love to help. We could either cut a hole in an existing dress and drape the fabric around your belly or just make a whole new dress from scratch."

"I like the cut-out idea better. We can either shop for a white dress or order one online." Audrey looked relieved but kept shooting me small, knowing smiles.

"Sebastian needs some '70s clothes too." Scarlett’s eyes flicked to me again, and it was starting to grate on my nerves. Since we’d finished eating, I started clearing the table.

"Grayson needs robes. Maybe we can go shopping this week. Halloween’s right around the corner, and our free time is limited." Audrey pointed out.

"True. We should get moving on that." Scarlett agreed.

Sebastian caught my eye and tilted his head toward the front door. I followed him outside while the girls kept chatting, settling onto the porch swing as he leaned against the railing. "Here." He handed me another beer.

"Thanks." I finished the one I had, cracked open the new one, and took a sip before he spoke.

"We don’t have to name her that." Sebastian started.

I waved him off. "It just caught me off guard. We haven’t even talked about names yet. My focus has been on Lorenzo, not baby names."

"You’ve got three to name, not just one. Plus, a warrior’s child needs a strong name."

"Did you come out here to plead your mate’s case?" I asked, a hint of irritation slipping through.

"No. Enzo got back to me earlier. There’s another event tomorrow. If we want to secure the old man’s funding, we need to move fast."

"What about Lorenzo?" I asked, intrigued.

"Rumors say he won’t be there." Sebastian met my gaze.

"You think this is our best shot?" I took another long sip, weighing our options. Sitting around, waiting for an attack—or for Lorenzo to grow stronger—wasn’t exactly a winning strategy.

"There’s no perfect play, but if we do nothing, Lorenzo only gets stronger." Sebastian echoed my thoughts.

"Exactly. Let’s hear what he has to say." I finished just as the girls stepped outside. Audrey settled beside me on the swing while Scarlett took a chair.

"What are you two plotting?" Audrey asked.

"We’re heading out again." Sebastian said simply.

"You’ve been gone a lot lately." Scarlett pointed out.

"You want us to let Lorenzo run loose?" I snapped, irritation flaring.

"That’s not what she meant." Audrey placed a hand on my knee. "Every time you leave, we worry you won’t come back."

"If we don’t go, the fight comes here—and that means more bloodshed." I draped an arm around her, pulling her close. Pressing a kiss to her forehead, I tried to push reassurance into her.

"If the event’s tomorrow, we should leave tonight." Sebastian said, though he sounded uncertain.

"Yeah, we can make it by morning."

"At this rate, you two should just rent a place there." Scarlett joked half-heartedly.

"No. You need to come home. Who knows when these babies will decide to arrive?" Audrey’s voice wavered with worry.

"I won’t miss it." I placed a hand on her stomach, feeling the little kicks beneath my palm.

"Still, we should leave tonight. Probably just a day or two."

"You might as well stay for the auction. Take the others with you?" Scarlett suggested.

"Probably. Extra cover, maybe plant someone inside." Sebastian agreed.

"Well, then you should probably get going so you can pack." Scarlett stood.

"Thanks for dinner!" Audrey smiled at them.

"Of course. It was nice catching up." Scarlett’s eyes lingered on me as we all rose.

"Take care. And give my niece some candy when you get home." I flashed her a grin.

"That’s the kind of uncle you’re going to be?"

"Obviously." I shrugged as Sebastian helped her down the steps and into their car.

"I can’t wait for this to be over so you don’t have to keep leaving." Audrey murmured as we headed inside.

"Same."

Upstairs, I pulled out the clothes I’d just unpacked a week ago. "Guess you can brainstorm baby names while you’re gone."

"Coming up with one is hard enough. Now we need three."

"All the baby stuff we ordered should arrive soon." Audrey sank into the rocking chair.

"Good. We’ll be back in time for me to put it all together."

"Thanks for cleaning up earlier." Audrey said as I zipped my bag.

"Of course. You shouldn’t be doing that stuff anyway. I’ll handle it." My words were for her, but my mind was already racing ahead—to Lorenzo, to the auction, to the fight waiting for us.



###Chapter 444

"Everyone set?" Sebastian asked as he slid into the passenger seat.

"Yep." A chorus of responses and a few grumbles came from the back. The warriors were happy to join—they'd had fun last time—but the long ride in this SUV wasn't ideal.

"Good. You all have a few hours to help Alpha Grayson brainstorm baby names," Sebastian announced.

My head whipped toward him in disbelief.

"What the hell did my sister do to you?" I demanded.

Laughter erupted from the backseat.

"You weren’t exactly cooperative earlier, so now she’s convinced we need to assist you," Sebastian explained, pulling out a folded piece of paper.

"Is that a list?" I asked, eyeing it warily.

"Yep." He started reading the first name, but I snatched it from his hand and tossed it out the window.

"Hey!"

"Tell my sister to kiss my ass."

I sighed, already dreading the rest of this trip.

"Waylon’s a solid name," one of the warriors chimed in from the back. "My mate and I considered it, but we ended up with girls."

"Wesley’s good too."

"Wesley sounds like a pretty boy’s name. Not an Alpha’s," I muttered, rubbing my temples.

Sebastian just smirked, thoroughly enjoying my suffering.

"Archer Alexander," someone suggested.

"That’s not bad," another agreed.

"Anton."

"Yeah, if you want him bullied in school."

The backseat erupted into debate over which names were superior. I had to admit, Archer Alexander had a nice ring to it.

"Grayson," another voice offered.

That one caught my attention. It was uncommon enough to stand out but not so rare that it sounded strange.

"Let’s talk about something else," I said, my tone firm.

They switched topics, but I tuned them out, letting their voices fade into background noise. My mind was elsewhere.

Nothing thrilled me more than the thought of meeting my three babies soon. But the crushing weight of knowing my heavily pregnant mate was in danger narrowed my focus to a single point.

Naming them now felt trivial.

I needed to focus on killing Raphael and dismantling whatever twisted operation he was building. Only his death would guarantee my mate and children’s safety. Bringing them into a world where he still breathed wasn’t an option.

After a quick stop for food, we reached our destination. Since I’d driven through the night, sunrise was only an hour away. Knowing the men needed rest, I pulled into a hotel.

Sebastian secured rooms for everyone. As they paired off and disappeared behind closed doors, he turned to me.

"What’s your plan?"

"Visiting the old man."

Sleep was impossible right now.

"Now?"

"I don’t want to risk daylight, and tonight’s the event—whatever that entails. I’d rather not cut it close. This way, we can scout ahead without rushing."

Sebastian sighed. "Let me grab my shoes."

I picked up my wallet. "You don’t have to come."

He rolled his eyes and followed me out.

I slid into the driver’s seat while Sebastian took shotgun. He stretched, settling in.

"Ready?"

"Fantastic."

I reversed out of the parking spot and merged back onto the road.

"What’s the plan?" Sebastian asked, setting his phone down.

"Simple. Offer him money for information."

"Straightforward."

"Let’s hope it works."

The rest of the drive passed in silence. Even as we reached the forest’s edge, neither of us spoke. Sebastian didn’t push, and I was grateful for it.

A thin line of smoke curled above the trees. Sebastian scaled one, binoculars in hand, scanning the area before signaling me.

I moved in.

The nocturnal creatures were settling as dawn approached. As I neared the cabin, movement flickered in the window.

Tricky.

I stayed hidden in the treeline, watching. The old man shuffled around, likely making coffee. Thankfully, no lights were on—either by choice or lack of electricity.

When he disappeared into another room, I seized my chance.

Darting to the back door, I scanned for threats. My palm was dry as I gripped the handle, turning it slowly.

I slipped inside, shutting the door quietly before sitting at the table. The moonlight illuminated just my boot—intentionally.

The old man limped back into the kitchen. I held my breath until he turned and spotted my foot.

The coffee pot shattered on the floor.

"W-who are you?" His voice wavered between fear and anger.

"We’ve met before."

I leaned forward, letting the light reveal my face.

###Chapter 445

The grizzled man narrowed his eyes at me before recognition flickered across his weathered face. "The hell do you want?" he rasped, lowering himself onto a creaking chair. His restless fingers twitched, missing the usual coffee cup they clutched.

"Thought we could talk."

"Last time we 'talked,' your hands nearly crushed my windpipe." He muttered something unintelligible under his breath, but the venom in his tone was unmistakable.

"In my position, sometimes extreme measures are necessary to get results."

"Take your bullshit elsewhere." He waved me off, pushing himself up with a wince and limping toward the cabinets. Pulling out a stained tea bag, he filled a grimy mug with lukewarm water before dunking it in. The man had an iron stomach.

"Word is you're running dry. Raphael cut you off, and now you're feeling the pinch."

To his credit, his expression barely twitched—but his eyes betrayed him. "Rumors."

"Rumors with teeth." Leaning forward, I slid a crisp hundred-dollar bill across the table. "This is just the start."

"Why the hell would I want your money?" His gaze lingered on the cash, but he made no move to take it.

"Because you're desperate. This place is sinking, and by the looks of it, you don’t even have power."

He scoffed, shifting uncomfortably. "How’d you figure that?"

"Seriously?" I gestured around. "Lights are on but nothing’s lit. You heated your coffee over a damn candle, and now you're drinking cold tea. That’s a caffeine blend—good luck staying awake later. Let’s cut the crap."

"What do you want?"

"Intel."

The old man grunted, trying to cross his bad leg over the other before wincing and abandoning the effort. He adjusted his posture twice before settling back with a sigh. "What kind?"

"Ever heard the saying, 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend'?"

He shot me a wary glance. "Who’s the enemy?"

"Raphael." I gave him a look like he was slow. "We both know I want him dead. Since Damian bit the dust, your paychecks stopped. Raphael’s not the sharing type. Take him out, and we both win—my family stays safe, and you keep this dump running."

"I don’t know shit about Raphael."

Now it was his turn to stare at me like I was an idiot. "Bullshit," I said flatly.

"Prove it." He slammed his cup down, cold tea sloshing over the rim. Neither of us flinched—it was just another stain in this hellhole.

"You know Magnus. Raphael’s right-hand man. You’ve heard things. A guy like you doesn’t survive by being deaf to whispers."

"You want me to betray him."

"Call it what you want. I only care about Raphael. Help me, and this place stays standing. Refuse, and I burn it down with him. Doubt me? Ask Damian what happens when I’m crossed."

"What happens after?"

"After what?"

He hobbled to the window, squinting at the dawn light filtering through the trees. My time was running out. "The offer’s simple. Take it or leave it."

"You’re backing me into a corner." His eyes darted outside, searching for something—or someone.

"I’ll see you tonight." I stood, looming over him as I reached for the door.

"Tonight?" He turned, gauging my reaction.

"I’ll be watching. You won’t see me, hear me, or feel me—but I’ll be there. Especially if you refuse."

Before he could respond, I yanked the door open and bolted. Every instinct screamed at me to move. My wolf bristled under my skin, agitated. Then I saw it—a flash of brown fur darting between the trees.

I froze.

A small, tawny wolf locked eyes with me. Enzo. They’d arrived.

Sebastian dropped from a nearby branch as I reached him. "Cutting it close. I almost sent Enzo in after you."

"Felt it was time to go," I murmured as he fiddled with a device. "What’s that?"

"Camera. Won’t cover his house, but it’ll catch movement in this sector. Magnus came through here last time—might ID some faces. We’ll plant more tonight."

The unease gnawed at me. My wolf paced, tense. "We need to leave. Now."

"Yeah." Sebastian coiled the last of the wiring and shoved it into his pack. "Move."

We sprinted for the car, the growls of unseen wolves raising the hair on our necks.
###Chapter 446

Sebastian's voice had an unsettling edge to it. "Enzo just mind-linked me. There are new players involved."

I bit my tongue, keeping silent until we reached our vehicle. The tension radiating off Sebastian was palpable. Whatever Enzo had told him, it wasn't good news.

Once we were inside, I finally asked, "What's happening?"

Sebastian ran a hand through his hair, frustration clear in his movements. "I don't even know how to process this."

I scoffed. "We're the strongest Alphas on this continent. Who could possibly shake Enzo like this?"

His gaze locked onto mine. "Don Vittorio Romano."

"The Italian Mafia Don?"

Sebastian nodded grimly. "Exactly."

"That's impossible. He's human."

"Not according to Enzo. He scented his wolf immediately. And his inner circle? All wolves."

My mind reeled. "So he's a wolf running the largest crime syndicate in Europe, masquerading as human?"

"Precisely. That's why he's stayed under the radar. But showing up here and revealing himself? That paints a target on his back." Sebastian stared blankly out the window, lost in thought.

"Do you think the other Alphas refused to ally with him?" I mused.

As I drove back to the hotel, Sebastian scrutinized the surveillance feed, jotting down names and taking screenshots.

Once we were back in our room, he turned to me. "Where are Magnus and Victoria?"

I pulled up the tracker on my phone. "Still at the cabin."

Sebastian's jaw tightened. "We should send someone to check on them tonight. I have a feeling Lorenzo will be parading around with Don Vittorio, flaunting their alliance."

"Smart move." The gravity of the situation settled over me. I paced the room, my nerves frayed. Sebastian was buried in his phone, and neither of us slept a wink.

I dialed Nathan. He answered immediately. "Alpha."

"I need a discreet team to verify Magnus and Victoria's status. Their vitals are stable, but they haven't moved. We need eyes on them."

Nathan hesitated. "Is everything alright?"

"Honestly? No. There's a new player in the game, and it's bad."

A beat of silence. Then, "Understood. Anything else?"

I glanced at Sebastian. "Was it Benjamin who retrieved the intel for Scarlett?"

Sebastian nodded without looking up.

"Nathan, get Benjamin digging up everything on Don Vittorio Romano."

"The mafia don?" Nathan's voice wavered in disbelief. Then it clicked.

"Fuck."

"Yeah. Any known U.S. residences, connections—anything."

"But he's human—"

"No. He's not."

A long pause. Then Nathan exhaled sharply. "Damn. On it." The line went dead.

Sebastian finally looked up, exhaustion lining his face. "We need rest. If things proceed as before, we move in five hours."

I barely suppressed an eye roll. "Sleep. Right." I collapsed onto the bed, the worn-out springs groaning under my weight.

Sebastian stood, phone in hand. "I'm calling your sister. Be back soon." He slipped out, already dialing.

Alone, I called Audrey.

Her voice soothed me instantly. "Hey. How's it going?"

"Not great. Listen, I need you at the packhouse. Call it overprotectiveness, but until I know more, I need you under guard."

Her tone sharpened. "What aren't you telling me?"

"Just that there's a new threat. I need you safe."

A pause. Then, resigned, "Fine. The nursery supplies arrived. I'll set up in the office and have the staff prep everything."

Relief flooded me. No argument. "Bring in a recliner. Make yourself comfortable."

"Alright. But Grayson... are you okay?"

I rubbed my face, exhaustion weighing me down. "Yeah. Just need a few hours of sleep before we head out."

"Okay. I love you. Get some rest."

"Love you too." A yawn escaped me.

Audrey's voice softened. "And Grayson?"

"Yeah?"

"Please be careful."

"Always."

The door opened as Sebastian returned. "Your sister's orders—sleep." He rolled his eyes.

I smirked. "Scarlett's got you whipped, huh?"

"Try dealing with her pregnancy mood swings. Fiery is an understatement."

"Not my problem."

Something soft smacked my face—a pillow.

Sebastian sighed. "Sleep. We move in four."
###Chapter 447

"Alright, everyone. You know what needs to be done." Sebastian's sharp gaze swept over the assembled team.

"How do I look?" Dante, our top undercover operative, adjusted the collar of his worn leather jacket. A master of disguise, he could blend into any environment effortlessly. His contact lenses doubled as high-tech cameras, streaming live footage directly to us. With his scruffy beard, faded jeans, and a beanie pulled low over his brow, he looked every bit the part of a man who belonged in the shadows.

"Perfect. Don’t waste time." I nudged him forward.

Sebastian checked the surveillance feeds and gave a curt nod. "Move out."

We watched as Dante disappeared into the dense forest. The rest of the team dispersed, taking up concealed positions to monitor the operation from a distance.

I clenched my fists, itching to be in that underground den myself. But tonight, we had to rely on Dante’s eyes. Sending him in alone was risky, but bringing backup would raise suspicion. The plan was simple—make it seem like he was just another face in the crowd, someone who might be associated with Don Vittorio Romano, but not enough to draw attention.

"Check in." Sebastian pulled up the live feeds on his laptop, scanning each operative’s visuals.

Dante was still walking, casually lighting a cigar as he went. Headlights flickered in the distance, and shadows moved to his left. The murmur of voices grew louder as he approached the entrance.

"In position." A voice crackled through the comms. My focus remained locked on Dante’s feed, though I spared a glance at the sniper’s scope view—crosshairs trained directly on Dante’s back.

Two perspectives now: Dante’s steady advance and the sniper’s watchful eye. He moved smoothly behind a burly man in a long trench coat, blending seamlessly into the gathering crowd.

"Is audio working?" I needed to hear every word.

"Hold on." Sebastian adjusted the settings, and suddenly, voices flooded my ears.

"...Glad you could join us tonight. I think you’ll find the evening’s entertainment… enlightening." The older man’s voice was rough, his tone laced with authority.

"I expect everything I requested has been prepared." My phone buzzed in my pocket.

Nathan’s name flashed on the screen. I swiped it open. "Almost at the safehouse."

I placed the phone on my thigh, keeping it visible for updates. "Nathan’s checking on Magnus and Victoria now."

"Don Vittorio, please proceed inside with your men. Refreshments have been provided. The show will begin shortly."

Dante slipped behind the last bodyguard with practiced ease. As the mafia figures descended into the underground den, he followed without hesitation.

"Uncle! It’s been too long!" My blood turned to ice at Lorenzo’s voice. He made a grand entrance, drawing every eye in the room.

Dante retreated to a shadowed corner, taking a seat beside three other silent observers. No one spoke. No one moved. They simply watched.

"Lorenzo. It has been a while." Don Vittorio’s expression was unreadable, but he accepted the embrace.

"Come, I’ve reserved the best seats for you." Lorenzo led them to a table directly facing the caged arena.

An elderly man descended the stairs, sealing the door behind him. The lights dimmed, leaving only a single spotlight over the ring.

"Showtime," Sebastian muttered.

"Mafia men usually have some respect for women. What kind of event is this?" I murmured, more to myself than anyone else.

I got my answer seconds later.

A table was dragged into the ring, a single chair placed atop it. Two men hauled in a chained prisoner, forcing him into the seat. The man thrashed, defiance burning in his eyes. "What the hell is this? Let me go!"

My stomach twisted. He was human.

"Tonight, we have something special planned." Lorenzo stepped into the ring, rolling up his sleeves. "In honor of my uncle’s visit, I’d like to showcase my latest… achievements."

This was a gamble. Lorenzo’s reputation was on the line, and he knew it. Some faces in the crowd were familiar; others weren’t. Sebastian snapped screenshots while I analyzed every detail.

"Rumors have been spreading—doubts about my capabilities. So tonight, with my uncle as witness, I’ll prove what I’ve accomplished. What Dominic and I were working on before his… unfortunate demise." Lorenzo paused, producing a syringe filled with a dark red liquid.

"You see, Dominic had a business selling women. He’d collect them, then auction them off. But what you didn’t know?" Lorenzo smirked. "He was experimenting on them first."

Shouts erupted. Some men lunged to their feet, only to be forced back into their seats by armed guards. Respect was demanded here—violently, if necessary.

"As I was saying…" Lorenzo circled the chained man. "Dominic harvested their blood. For science. Together, we developed something revolutionary. A serum." He held up the syringe, the liquid glinting ominously. "This? This can turn a human into one of us."

With a swift motion, he plunged the needle into the prisoner’s neck.

The man screamed.

###Chapter 448

"What?" The collective gasp echoed through my earpiece. "Did we hear that correctly?"

Sebastian and I remained frozen, our eyes locked on the horrific scene unfolding before us. The man's agonized screams filled the air.

"While the transformation takes effect, I'll continue explaining," Lorenzo said smoothly, snapping his fingers. Guards swiftly moved in, silencing the man with tape over his mouth. Though his screams were muffled, Lorenzo's voice cut through clearly.

He paced like a predator, his gaze sweeping over the crowd without truly seeing anyone—yet ensuring every man felt his presence.

"Recently, I acquired the blood of a high-ranking wolf. It's what we used today, but as you can see, perfection takes time." He spread his hands in mock surrender. "After extensive trials, we've determined the ideal blood type and the best candidates for survival. Ranking wolf blood is superior—strong, potent. And oddly enough, female blood yields better results."

The crowd erupted in outrage.

"Bullshit!"

"You're lying!"

"Listen!" Lorenzo raised his hands, silencing them. "Women endure pain better—it's a fact. Think about it. They're disciplined constantly, bent over cleaning, cooking, serving. Their monthly cycles alone are torture. We tested both genders—females consistently survived the transformation at higher rates. Dominic conducted thorough interviews, assessing pain tolerance and drawing blood for analysis."

My stomach churned. Scarlett had been right. We weren't entirely wrong about that house, but we'd missed the bigger picture. Dominic lured women in, interviewed them about their blood, likely took what he wanted from them—then sold them off for profit to fund his twisted experiments.

My phone buzzed. Nathan's message made my blood run cold:

Magnus and Victoria are missing. Trackers were found planted on some of our men.

I showed Sebastian the screen. His jaw tightened.

"He used Magnus's blood," I whispered.

"Victoria doesn't have ranking blood, does she?"

"No. Her lineage is warrior-class."

"That's why they want Audrey," Sebastian murmured. "She's an Alpha female—the strongest there is."

My attention snapped back to the screen as Lorenzo stepped aside. The human was convulsing—nails elongating into claws, hair sprouting across his body, eyes shifting into something feral.

"The downside?" Lorenzo continued. "Once they turn, they lose their humanity. But they obey commands without question—loyal, strong. With ranking blood in their veins, they can overpower ordinary wolves. Imagine an army of them."

Dante's gaze swept the room. Some men nodded eagerly; others looked sick.

The man's screams morphed into guttural growls. Tape split as fangs tore through it. His shoes shredded, revealing clawed feet.

"What's in that serum?" someone shouted.

Lorenzo smirked. "Trade secrets. But let's just say... it's a blend of rare herbs, drugs, and other special ingredients. And soon, I'll have the strongest blood of all—making this unstoppable."

"Whose blood is the strongest?" Dante's eyes flicked to Don Vittorio.

"Audrey Atwater," Lorenzo answered, his voice dripping with greed.

"Alpha Grayson's mate? Audrey?" a man yelled.

"Exactly. Did you know she was the last heir to the Alpha title? As Dominic's older sister, she was meant to inherit everything."

"Then why target Evelyn?" another shouted.

"I thought he just wanted her body!"

"Half-true," Lorenzo said. "He wanted to mate her—their offspring would've been powerful. With her intelligence and bloodline, she should've been the strongest female. Grayson is her twin—their DNA is identical, making her three-quarters Alpha blood. But Audrey? She holds two Alpha titles now—plus Luna. She's pure, 100% Alpha blood."

A man scoffed. "So you plan to kidnap the pregnant mate of one of the strongest Alphas in the country? Between him and Sebastian, they're untouchable."

"Not entirely." Lorenzo pointed at him. "With my uncle's help—and all of us united—we'll have the numbers. Add these enhanced soldiers?" He grinned. "Victory is guaranteed."

On cue, the transformed man snapped his chains and stood. A deep growl rumbled from his chest before he relaxed, panting. Then—he threw back his head and howled.

The men responded in kind, howling like a pack. Even Dante joined, blending in seamlessly.

"One more incentive," Lorenzo purred. "Audrey isn't just pregnant—she's carrying triplets. Those pups will have her blood and Grayson's running through their veins."

"Pups?" someone echoed.

Lorenzo's smile widened. "Ah, glad you caught that. Yes—triplets."

###Chapter 449

"Triplets?" The hushed murmurs around the room sent chills down my spine.

"Imagine taking one of those children and raising it as your own. You could harvest their blood whenever necessary."

My entire body went rigid as the horrifying plan unfolded. Sebastian had already risen, barking orders into his phone, but his voice faded into the background. They didn’t want to kill Audrey or sell her. They wanted her blood. They wanted my unborn children—to use them as living blood banks for their twisted army.

"Men! Fall back immediately! The moment Dante breaks free, we move!" Sebastian’s sharp command crackled through our earpieces, snapping me out of my daze. White-hot fury surged through my veins.

"Audrey is at the packhouse. Nathan has doubled security and is with her," Sebastian informed me as he dropped back into his seat.

"Move Evelyn there too. She may not be their primary target, but they won’t hesitate to take her if given the chance," Lorenzo interjected. He was right—Evelyn carried Alpha blood. Sebastian bolted up again as I kept listening.

"Who needs a demonstration?" Lorenzo’s face glowed with sick excitement. Dante maneuvered through the crowd, his gaze landing on Don Vittorio Romano’s expressionless face. No smirk, no amusement—nothing. The mafia commandments were their law. Wives were to be respected as equals. Italian men didn’t share American values—they adhered to tradition, where women were untouchable unless provoked.

Which meant Audrey should be safe.

But Lorenzo clearly had other plans—plans that involved not just Audrey, but our unborn children. And if I remembered correctly, one of their sacred laws was honoring appointments. If I could secure a meeting with Don Vittorio on neutral ground, I might walk away unscathed.

"Dante. Activate Bluetooth and grab Don Vittorio’s number. If he has an iPhone, we can sync it. Your phone’s a burner anyway," I ordered.

Sebastian shot me a confused look but didn’t argue. The event was winding down, guests rising from their seats. We watched, tense, as Dante stood too. Phones were banned, so he had to be careful. Thankfully, the crowd had swarmed Lorenzo, gawking at the newly transformed werewolf.

Dante downed his drink and feigned a stumble into the crowd. His bodyguards blocked any direct approach. Just as I considered creating a distraction, Dante deliberately brushed against another man’s crotch.

"You bastard! Watch where you’re going!" The man’s fist collided with Dante’s jaw. Dante twisted mid-fall, landing between the guards and crashing into Don Vittorio.

"Whoa!" someone shouted. By the time Dante blinked up, he was being hauled up by his collar.

"This creep groped me!" the attacker snarled, also restrained.

"I was just trying to see the damn wolf!" Dante spat, struggling weakly.

"Both of you—out!" An elder stormed to the door and flung it open. They were dragged up the stairs and dumped outside. "Don’t come back!"

Dante staggered but stayed upright, playing drunk. The other man face-planted into the dirt. "Pathetic," Dante muttered.

"Say that again!" The man lurched up, swaying.

I wasn’t wasting time. "Dante, knock him out and get back."

As the man charged, Dante sidestepped and drove his fist into the man’s temple. The crack of his neck was so loud I wondered if Dante had broken it.

The team cheered as Dante returned, tossing me his phone before sliding into the SUV.

"Heading home?"

"Sebastian, take the wheel," I said.

He nodded, and we switched places. As we sped off, I combed through the photos, matching names to faces, compiling dossiers on every attendee.

While the others dozed in the back, I typed relentlessly. Hopefully, Benjamin had intel for me too. But first—I’d call Don Vittorio tomorrow and request that meeting. I was banking on their so-called commandments, but what choice did I have? This was my family. If it meant sitting down with the devil himself, so be it.

Finally, the truth was clear. Every disjointed clue had clicked into place. The relief of knowing was overshadowed by a gnawing dread.

Failure wasn’t an option. The next 24 hours would decide whether I declared war or remained focused on a single target. The old man meant nothing now. I had what I needed.

By the time we reached home, my files were complete—every face identified, every detail logged. I had Don Vittorio’s number. Now, I just needed to study mafia etiquette.

I had a mission. And nothing—nothing—would stop me.

"Everyone’s waiting in your office," Sebastian said as we piled out of the SUV. His voice yanked me from my thoughts.

"Where’s Benjamin? Does he have anything yet?"
###Chapter 450

"I'm not certain. We'll have to ask them once we're inside." Sebastian stepped out of the car.

From this moment on, we were going into complete lockdown. "Warriors," I mind-linked the pack. "Initiate stage five lockdown!"

A chorus of 'Yes, Alpha' echoed back instantly, followed by the blaring alarm. It signaled that no one was permitted to leave or enter our territory—only movement within was allowed.

As I climbed the stairs, an oppressive weight settled in my chest. It was an unfamiliar sensation, but I recognized it immediately. Fear. The fear of losing my family.

The moment we entered the office, my gaze locked onto Audrey. She was seated in my chair, laughing softly at something someone had said. Every eye in the room turned toward Sebastian and me as I shut the door behind us.

"This isn't good," Scarlett murmured. She tried to rise, but Sebastian reached her first, gently pressing her back into her seat.

"Audrey," I said, kneeling before her and taking her hands in mine. "We had an agreement. I promised I wouldn’t hide anything from you that concerns you. What I’m about to discuss involves you directly. Do you want to stay, or would you prefer to leave?"

Audrey searched my face, absorbing the gravity in my expression. The room was silent, but I didn’t care. I watched as she processed that whatever was coming wasn’t good news. "I... I don’t know," she whispered.

"It’s your choice. But you must remain calm. Any stress could harm you and the babies."

"Maybe I should go get something to eat," she said, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.

"That sounds like a good idea." I pulled her into my arms, her familiar scent wrapping around me like a balm. It should have been me comforting her, but instead, her presence steadied me. Being apart from her had been agony, and today had only made it worse. Beneath her usual fragrance, I could now detect the faint, unique scents of our unborn pups. The realization nearly brought me to my knees. My family.

"Come on, Audrey. I’ll walk with you," Cassandra offered, standing and extending her hand.

"Take a guard with you at all times. Do not leave their side," I instructed firmly.

Audrey nodded as I helped her up. "Okay," she murmured.

"Nathan," I mind-linked one of our most skilled warriors. "Luna Audrey is heading to the kitchen. You are to stay with her no matter what. Understood?"

"Understood, Alpha," he responded immediately. His voice echoed down the hall as he greeted them.

Once the door closed behind them, I hit the security button. The windows and doors sealed shut with a heavy thud. No one was leaving, and nothing was getting in.

"What’s going on?" Scarlett asked, her voice trembling.

I dragged my fingers through my hair, my stress bleeding through.

"Grayson..." Scarlett’s tone was the one she only used when she was terrified. Her eyes mirrored the dread in mine.

"I can explain," Sebastian offered.

"No." I took a deep breath. "Lorenzo has an uncle. Don Vittorio Romano."

"Isn’t that the mafia boss?" Nathan asked.

"He’s based in Italy," Oliver added.

"...and human," Nathan finished.

"Wrong on all counts," I cut in sharply. Their heads snapped toward me. "He’s in the U.S. now. He is the head of the Italian mafia, but he’s here—and he’s Lorenzo’s uncle. Lorenzo has called in his mafia connections to assist in his... business."

"The mafia doesn’t deal in human trafficking," Scarlett said, though doubt flickered in her eyes. "Do they?"

I shook my head. "Lorenzo isn’t trafficking humans. He’s created a potion that turns humans into werewolves. Their humanity is erased, but they become wolves. The catch? The potion requires werewolf blood. The higher the rank, the stronger the blood."

"He made a werewolf?" Oliver looked stunned.

"Correct."

"You saw this?" Oliver’s gaze darted to Sebastian as if questioning my sanity.

Sebastian nodded. "We watched it happen."

"How?" Scarlett whispered, her voice distant.

I leaned forward, gripping the back of my chair until my claws dug into the leather. "That house we burned down? It wasn’t just a trafficking den. Lorenzo lured women there under false pretenses. He experimented on them in the basement. Females are genetically more resilient—childbirth, endurance, physical strain. The higher-ranked the female, the stronger the blood, the more successful the transformation."

"Audrey is an Alpha..." Scarlett paled.

"That’s why they originally wanted you. We’re twins—our genetics are identical. You were the strongest female when I became Alpha. Lorenzo wanted to breed you to create a bloodline for his experiments. But Audrey inherited the pack. She’s a true Alpha female—stronger than you. They want her blood. And they want our pups to raise as their own personal blood supply."

The words burned like acid in my throat. My claws tore through the chair, foam spilling onto the floor. The room was dead silent.

Scarlett clapped a hand over her mouth. Oliver and Nathan looked murderous. Sophia’s face was a mask of horror.

"What’s our next move?" Nathan growled, his eyes blazing with fury.

###Chapter 451

"I'm going to call Matteo and request a meeting."

The room exploded into chaos.

"What the hell are you thinking?" Scarlett's voice cut through the noise, sharp and furious.

"No way!"

"Enough!" I raised my hand, and the room fell silent. Only then did I continue. "One of the unspoken rules among mafia men is that meetings are sacred. They don’t skip them, and the space is neutral. Of course, I’ll bring backup, but this is just a conversation."

"About what?" Scarlett demanded, her eyes blazing. Sebastian had an arm wrapped around her waist as if he expected her to lunge at me.

"Mafia families don’t interfere in each other’s wars. This isn’t Lorenzo’s fight—it’s Raphael’s. Raphael started this without any provocation from us. This meeting will let me gauge Matteo’s stance. By the end, I’ll know if we’re declaring war on two fronts or if Raphael remains our only target. We’ll lay out our intentions and move accordingly."

Oliver stood abruptly and began pacing. "You’re putting a lot of trust in a mafia don."

"A don who operates on respect. If we show it, we should receive it in return."

Nathan spoke next. "This could go wrong in a hundred different ways."

"I know. But what choice do I have? My mate and our unborn triplets are at stake. If they get their hands on them, they’ll disappear into Italy, and I’ll never see them again."

The weight of my words settled over the room. Scarlett finally sank onto Sebastian’s lap, and Oliver followed suit.

"Scarlett, you need protection too. Their main target might be Audrey, but your bloodline is just as strong. If they get the chance, they’ll take you."

Her gaze turned distant. "Okay," she murmured, more to herself than anyone else.

"I think we all need to rest tonight and regroup tomorrow. I’ll call Matteo in the morning after I do some research."

"Sounds good," Oliver said after a beat, standing and taking Sophia’s hand.

I returned to my desk and unlocked my laptop.

"Grayson?" Scarlett’s voice made me look up. Her eyes held an emotion I rarely saw—fear.

"I’m fine, sis. We’ll figure this out, just like we always do." I forced a reassuring smile, though it was a lie. I wasn’t okay, but I wouldn’t let my pregnant sister spiral over my emotional state.

"You’re not fine, but I’ll focus on this."

I flashed her a grin, trying to lighten the mood. "We’ve already won."

Her expression told me she didn’t believe me, but she didn’t argue. Sebastian guided her out, giving me a firm nod before following. Oliver and Sophia left next, but Nathan lingered.

"What’s the plan?" he asked.

"I’m trying to find the safest place for Audrey. Honestly, I have an idea, but it’s extreme." I pulled up my browser and searched for mafia protocols.

"Where?"

"The cells."

Nathan’s eyebrows shot up. "You’re joking."

"Think about it. It’s underground. Nothing’s getting through. Who would even think to look there? If you were them, where would you expect us to hide her?"

"Damn." He dragged a hand through his hair. "Is there even cell service down there?"

"No. No visitors, and we’d need a solid communication plan."

"A better solution would be building a panic room. Dig a massive hole and make our own."

I glanced at him. Though he’d said it sarcastically, it wasn’t a bad idea. We could construct one for the pack’s high-ranking women and another for the rest. A failsafe.

"That’s actually brilliant. You’re in charge. I want it done in a week." I turned back to my screen before he could protest.

"Wait—what?"

"You’re overseeing the construction of a safe room for Audrey and our children. One week."

"But—there’s no way—"

"Make it happen, Nathan." My tone left no room for argument.

He exhaled sharply. "Fine. I’m on it."

Just as he turned to leave, the office door opened.

"Am I interrupting?" Audrey’s voice was like honey to my ears.

"No. I was just leaving," Nathan muttered, looking frazzled.

She waited until he was gone before speaking. "What’s his problem?"

"No idea, and I don’t care."

"Everyone looked upset when they left. It’s bad, isn’t it?" Her voice wavered.

I didn’t want to lie. "Yeah, it’s bad. I can either explain, or you can trust me to keep you safe—which means doing exactly as I say without question."

"I’d do that anyway, but give me the short version."

She bit her lip, waiting.

"Are you sure?"

"Just the PG-13 summary."

I exhaled. "Okay."
###Chapter 452

The truth was far more twisted than I had imagined.

"Dominic wanted Scarlett for a reason," Grayson explained, his voice low and serious. "He's created a potion—one that can turn humans into werewolves. But not just any werewolves. These creatures lose their humanity entirely. They become mindless, aggressive beasts, loyal only to their creator."

I swallowed hard. "And to make this potion... they need blood."

Grayson nodded. "The stronger the blood, the more potent the potion. Female blood is stronger than male blood. And an alpha female's blood?" His jaw tightened. "The strongest of all."

I let the words sink in.

Audrey's expression shifted as she pieced it together. "So... they want my blood."

"Yes," Grayson confirmed. "And not just yours. They want our children too. To raise them as their own personal blood supply."

For a long moment, Audrey was silent. Her face was unreadable, but I could feel the storm of emotions through our bond—anger, fear, disbelief.

Then, to my surprise, she exhaled sharply. "Honestly? It's not as bad as I thought."

I blinked. "Not as bad?"

She shrugged. "I was imagining organ harvesting or something. This is still horrible, but at least it's not that."

I couldn't help but smirk at her resilience. "Nathan is building you an underground safe room. But that's not all."

Audrey tensed. "What else?"

"Raphael has connections. Powerful ones. His uncle is Don Vittorio Romano—head of the Romano crime family. And he's here."

Audrey let out a slow whistle. "That is not good."

"I know."

"So what's the plan?"

Leaning forward, I rested my arms on the desk. "I'm going to call him. Request a meeting."

Audrey's eyes widened. "What?"

"If what I've learned is true, the mafia respects formal meetings. If we handle this right, we might avoid bloodshed."

She crossed her arms, giving me a skeptical look. "Oh, so you Googled 'mafia etiquette' and now you're an expert?"

I smirked. "It's worth a shot."

"Fine." She leaned back, challenging me. "Call him."

I glanced at the clock. "It's late."

Audrey rolled her eyes. "He's a crime boss from Italy. Trust me, he's awake. Call him."

With a sigh, I picked up the phone and dialed, putting it on speaker.

It rang four times before a deep, accented voice answered. "Who is this?"

"Alpha Grayson, Don Vittorio."

A pause. Then, amusement laced his tone. "How did you get this number?"

"Is that really the question you want to ask me?" I let my alpha power seep into my voice. Audrey shivered, her cheeks flushing.

"I suppose not," Don Vittorio conceded. "What do you want?"

"I'd like to request a meeting. I understand you're in the country, and there are... delicate matters we should discuss."

"A meeting?" He sounded intrigued. "You're bold, Alpha."

"I prefer to handle things face-to-face. If we're going to be enemies, I'd rather there be no misunderstandings. Blood spilled over miscommunication is a waste."

"Agreed," he said after a moment. "Unnecessary violence is bad for business."

"Then we can speak like civilized men."

A low chuckle. "You've piqued my interest. Fine. I'll grant you a meeting."

"Thank you. I have one request."

"Oh?"

"Raphael cannot be present. I can't guarantee I won't kill him on sight."

Don Vittorio burst into laughter. "I like you, Alpha. Very well. Raphael won't be there. Meet me tomorrow at 5 PM—The Emerald Crown Casino. My men will escort you in."

"I'll bring two guards and one advisor."

"Expected. No harm will come to you under my roof. We'll talk like gentlemen."

"Thank you, Don Vittorio."

"Until tomorrow."

The line went dead.

Audrey exhaled sharply. "Well. That just happened."

I grinned. "Now we wait."

Her eyes gleamed with determination. "And prepare."

###Chapter 453

The moment I ended the call, Audrey gaped at me as if I’d just risen from the dead. "Well, looks like I'm leaving again tomorrow."

"How did you get his number?"

"Complicated story," I muttered, already dialing Sebastian’s number.

He picked up after two rings. "What’s going on?"

"We’re meeting with Don Vittorio."

A beat of silence. "Excuse me?"

"Audrey suggested I call him, so I did. He agreed to meet tomorrow at five at the Diamond Crown Casino. Nathan, Oliver, you, and I are going in. Nathan and Oliver will guard the entrance. You and I will talk to him. I made sure Lorenzo wouldn’t be there—otherwise, I’d have to kill him. He promised no bloodshed."

"Well, damn," Sebastian exhaled.

"How can you trust him?" Scarlett’s voice cut in sharply.

"It’s not about trust. It’s a temporary truce. We’ll talk like civilized people."

"Does that mean I have to wear a suit?" Sebastian groaned.

"Absolutely. We’re representing the werewolves. If this goes well, we might strike a deal with the most powerful mafia boss in the city."

"And if it doesn’t?" Scarlett pressed.

"Then we’re declaring war on Lorenzo and his mafia uncle." There was no other way.

"I don’t like this, Grayson. Too many things could go wrong." Her worry was palpable, and while I understood, it grated on me. We’d done everything to keep her safe. Now, it was Audrey’s turn.

"I won’t let Audrey become their next victim, Scarlett. If I have to face Don Vittorio alone, I will."

"That’s not what I meant, and you know it."

"Alright!" Sebastian interjected quickly. "See you tomorrow." The line went dead.

"She doesn’t want Sebastian to go?" Audrey asked softly.

I’d almost forgotten she was still here with Scarlett’s outburst. "It’s not about you. We’ve been taking too many risks lately, and it’s wearing on her." I tried to reassure her, though the tension lingered.

"I packed us a bag to stay here tonight," Audrey said, swiftly changing the subject.

"That was thoughtful. Ready to turn in?"

She hesitated before standing. "Can we watch a movie first?"

"Of course." I glanced at my laptop. "Start it up. I’ll be right there."

Audrey gave me a small smile as she headed for the door. "Don’t take too long."

"I won’t."

The moment the door clicked shut, I jotted down urgent notes. First—Magnus and Victoria. The fact they’d found the trackers was alarming. Victoria’s bond hadn’t snapped, meaning she was still alive. But if Lorenzo had them, they were likely being tortured.

Rescuing them was non-negotiable. I might not like them, but I wouldn’t abandon a pack member. The problem? No leads.

Second—the potential war. Realistically, that was the expected outcome. At least this meeting would give us a clearer picture. Don Vittorio wasn’t here for a vacation. Lorenzo needed backup.

Assuming the casino was his base was risky. I pulled out my phone and texted Sebastian:

Me: Send scouts to the Diamond Crown. Watch for Lorenzo or Don Vittorio. Follow if they leave. We need their base location to retrieve Magnus and Victoria. Cover all exits—especially underground. Surveillance only.

I hit send and was about to shut my laptop when my phone rang. Unknown number. My instincts prickled.

"Alpha Grayson," I answered firmly.

"Half a million. Cash." The old man’s raspy voice sent a chill down my spine.

It took me a second. "Fine."

"Just like that?" He sounded thrown.

"Give me something worthwhile first."

"Lorenzo flew his uncle in from Italy. Mafia royalty."

"Don Vittorio Romano. I know."

He scoffed. "Then how about this? There’s another auction in a week."

"Why should I care?"

"Magnus’s mate is on the list."

Now that got my attention. "Go on."

"I was given the buyer list. She’s the main attraction—Magnus’s mate. Lorenzo hates the mate bond, so Magnus had to let her go."

"He agreed to that?" I couldn’t hide my shock.

"He might’ve asked me to contact you as a favor. Doesn’t know I’m taking your money, though." Bitterness laced his words.

"Why help Magnus?"

"None of your damn business." His sudden anger surprised me.

"You care about him."

"Maybe I’ve helped him before. Doesn’t matter now."

"Where is she being held?" I checked the clock. Audrey would wonder where I was soon.

"No idea. That’s why I told you about the auction."

"Any suggestions on how to get her out?"

"Wait until she’s bought. Take her from the buyer."

"You want me to start a war with someone else?" He couldn’t be serious.

###Chapter 454

"Fine, then you solve it."

"Here's my offer. I'll give you $250,000 for the intel, and the rest after I get Victoria out. That should motivate you to come up with a plan that doesn't involve me pissing off another person. Let me deal with Lorenzo first."

I hung up before he could respond, then stood and made my way toward Audrey. My phone buzzed before I reached her.

Sebastian: Just sent them.

Pushing the door open, I quickly typed back: Found Victoria. Will update you tomorrow.

After hitting send, I slipped my phone into my pocket and glanced up. Audrey was already asleep on the couch, the movie’s opening credits still rolling. She hadn’t even made it past the first scene.

I grabbed fresh clothes from the closet, prepped for bed, then turned off the TV. Carefully, I lifted Audrey into my arms and carried her to bed. She didn’t stir as I tucked her in, curling protectively around her. With one hand resting on her stomach, I closed my eyes and let sleep take me.

Morning came too soon, the cold sheets jolting me awake. I reached for Audrey, but the space beside me was empty.

"Audrey?" I called, lifting my head to scan the room.

She sat on the couch, looking up at the sound of my voice. A soft smile played on her lips. "Sorry I fell asleep last night. Turns out I really do need that pregnancy pillow."

I dragged myself out of bed and joined her. "I’ll have someone bring it today, but I need you to stay here as much as possible."

"Don’t worry, I won’t argue. I finished all the Halloween party prep, and the programs I installed are running smoothly. Just minor hiccups—nothing unexpected."

"That’s great." Pride swelled in my chest. She’d handled everything perfectly.

"When do you leave? I had your suit pressed—it should be here in an hour." She turned back to her laptop.

"You’re literally the best person alive." I kissed her forehead before heading to the shower.

It had been a while since I’d trimmed my beard, and the length was getting out of hand. I preferred the shadow look, not something I could run my fingers through.

There was something revitalizing about a fresh shave and styled hair—like I had my life together.

"Grayson?"

Audrey peeked in as I finished at the mirror.

"Yeah?"

"Your suit’s here. So is Sebastian, but you should probably wait to change. Long car ride ahead."

"Good call."

She turned back to the couch, and when I followed, I found Sebastian and Oliver waiting.

"Ready?"

"You never answered my text," Sebastian frowned. "You found Victoria?"

"Victoria was missing?" Audrey, halfway through sitting up, jerked upright so fast she nearly toppled over. Oliver caught her just in time.

"Yeah. Think I found her." I shot Sebastian a glare—this wasn’t the time to drop bombs in front of Audrey. He caught on and quickly changed the subject.

"Our suits are in the car. Oliver, take Grayson’s down. We’ll be right behind you."

Oliver avoided eye contact and left with my suit.

"Not subtle," Audrey muttered, narrowing her eyes at me.

"You knew I wasn’t telling you everything. We just found out the trackers were compromised—no idea how long. I didn’t want to dump it all on you."

"Where is she?"

"Word is she’s being sold at auction in a week."

"Sold? At an auction?" Her expression dared me to take it back.

"Yes. But we’ll get her before that. I only found out last night. Once I have a plan, I’ll tell you."

"Good. Letting her go through that isn’t an option. We already killed her in front of the pack." Guilt laced her voice.

Knock, knock.

"Luna Aud—oh! Alpha Grayson!" A kitchen staff member froze in the doorway.

"It’s fine, come in," Audrey said, sitting back down.

The girl hesitated before wheeling in a tray of French toast and strawberries.

"Text me if you need anything. I’ll be back late tonight or tomorrow." I stepped around the breakfast to kiss Audrey.

"Be careful," she murmured, though her eyes were locked on the strawberries.

"Always am."

Sebastian rolled his eyes as we left. The second the door closed, I shoved him.

"Dude." He shot me a look.

"Why bring up Victoria? You know Audrey doesn’t need to hear everything."

"Sorry, man. Your sister’s been pissed at you for twelve hours straight. If she’s not mad, she’s worried."

"I’m a lovable guy." I smirked as we climbed into the car.

###Chapter 455

"Any updates from your team?" I asked, drumming my fingers against the leather seat.

We were idling in the casino's parking lot, our car positioned to face the entrance. The steady flow of guests—casual couples, sharply dressed businessmen—made it impossible to miss anyone entering or exiting. No children, though. The building's exterior boasted a rustic theme, with polished wooden beams and intricate carvings of forest creatures—a massive wolf statue stood prominently beside a grizzly bear.

Sebastian exhaled sharply. "No sightings. He must be operating from inside."

"I hate wearing suits," Oliver grumbled from the backseat. We'd stopped earlier to change, and now, with time to kill, my nerves were fraying.

Nathan thankfully shifted the topic. "You never told us what you learned about Victoria."

"The auction master confirmed she's on the list to be sold. We need a plan to extract her. No word on Magnus, though. According to him, Magnus is letting this happen but wants me to intervene."

Oliver scoffed. "He probably abandoned her and expects you to clean up his mess."

"If we save Victoria, Lorenzo will know Magnus tipped us off. He has to realize his time's running out," Nathan countered.

Sebastian and I exchanged glances as their back-and-forth started sounding more like a marital spat than strategy. "You really think Lorenzo would let Magnus walk free? No way he isn't tied up in some basement right now," Oliver said, sounding exasperated.

"Unless he gave him an ultimatum. He might’ve cut Victoria loose to save himself."

"Only if he was in too deep to escape."

Nathan snapped his fingers. "What if Magnus has to personally deliver her to the auction? Mixed in with the others, but still—he hands her over?"

"She's marked. No buyer would touch her. There's something else going on. They're distracting us with the auction to pull another move."

I shoved the car door open, done with the debate. Valid points or not, I needed to focus on this meeting first. Victoria would come next. "Let's move."

We stepped out, adjusting our jackets in unison. Sebastian and I let our auras ripple subtly—not enough to command submission, just enough to clear a path. Oliver and Nathan fell into step behind us, their bickering silenced as they assumed their roles as Betas.

The casino's automatic doors slid open, flooding my senses with the cacophony of slot machines and boozy laughter. The air was thick with the scent of liquor and cheap perfume. How any wolf could conduct business here was beyond me.

"Mr. Grayson?" A voice cut through the noise.

To my right stood a boyish-looking man in a tuxedo, barely out of his teens. "That's me."

"Excellent. Follow me." He pivoted without another word, leading us through the maze of gaming tables and bars before pushing open a discreet door.

The moment it shut behind Oliver, the clamor vanished. Soft elevator music hummed against velvet-lined walls as we descended a staircase. The decor shifted dramatically—black, red, and purple hues screamed vampire lair more than wolf territory. Velvet was overkill, but these places loved their theatrics.

At the bottom, a dimly lit hallway led to two guards flanking a single door. "Don Vittorio Romano will see you now."

"Appreciated," I said as the door swung open. Oliver and Nathan kept their hands clasped in front of them as we entered what looked less like an office and more like a penthouse suite. A sunken lounge area with a pool table sat beneath a raised desk. Golden lighting dotted the room, illuminating several armed men.

"Alpha Grayson! A pleasure!" The man from the video strode forward, arms wide.

"Thanks for meeting us. This is Alpha Sebastian." I shook his offered hand before he turned to Sebastian.

"An honor, Alpha Sebastian."

Sebastian gave a curt nod. "Hope we didn’t interrupt anything," I said, scanning the room. Six men stood at various posts, watchful.

Don Vittorio waved dismissively as he retreated behind his ornate desk. "Not at all. Any chance to meet the Duo of Death is time well spent."

"Duo of Death?" I echoed, caught off guard.

"You haven’t heard that one?" He chuckled. Sebastian and I exchanged glances.

"Can’t say I have."

"After what you did to Alpha Damian..." Don Vittorio trailed off, feigning innocence.

"My sister had the pleasure of killing him. I didn’t get the chance," I said, my voice edged with lingering fury.

"Ah, yes. Your twin. Mated to... him." He leaned back, steepling his fingers as he gestured at Sebastian.
###Chapter 456

The words hung heavy in the air, a declaration rather than a question. "An unbreakable alliance." I gave a firm nod, refusing to let even a flicker of hesitation show.

"Indeed." Don Vittorio Romano studied us for a long moment before gesturing to the plush chairs across from his desk. "Please, sit. Can I offer you a drink?"

"No, thank you." Grayson's voice was steady. "We don't indulge while working."

A drink would've been welcome, but if my intel was correct, mixing business with liquor was a quick way to lose respect in these circles.

"You requested this meeting," Don Vittorio said, pulling a cigar from a polished wooden box. I watched as he snipped the tip, lit it with deliberate care, and exhaled the first slow curl of smoke. "What is it you wish to discuss?"

"Lorenzo is your nephew," Grayson began, his tone razor-sharp. "If he doesn't accept that my Luna will never be his personal blood supply, I won't hold back next time I try to kill him. After his little stunt at the last gathering, I have more than enough justification for war." He leaned forward slightly. "I came to discuss where you stand in all this."

A slow smile spread across Don Vittorio's face. "I like you. Direct. No games. The world could use more men like you."

"Appreciate the compliment," Grayson replied smoothly.

Don Vittorio's gaze shifted to Sebastian. "And you? What's your role in this?"

"Standing with Grayson," Sebastian answered without hesitation. "Using every resource I have to ensure Luna Audrey's safety."

"Not surprising," Don Vittorio mused, taking another drag from his cigar. "You didn't earn that reputation by losing." He exhaled slowly. "Truthfully, I haven't decided where my loyalties lie. I must admit, Lorenzo's... progress intrigues me. An army of perfectly obedient wolves—can you truly say the idea doesn't tempt you?"

"Killing humans just to steal power?" Grayson's voice turned icy. "That's not something our kind tolerates. Lorenzo has made enemies of powerful men. The greedy might support him, but the rest? They won't."

"What if there was a compromise?" Don Vittorio tapped his cigar, letting the ashes fall onto the gleaming mahogany desk.

"A compromise?" My instincts flared in warning.

"Give him Luna Audrey's blood, and in return, he leaves your packs untouched."

"That doesn't change the fact he's murdering humans for power," Grayson countered. "That breaks our laws."

"But it would remove the immediate threat to your Luna," Don Vittorio pointed out.

"She won't be in danger if Lorenzo is dead," I said, my voice tight.

"Touche." More ash drifted onto the desk.

"You know his allies abandoned him after Dominic and Damian fell," Grayson pressed. "His failures are piling up. His time is running out—not just from me, but from every creditor Dominic left behind. They'll come for him. Sebastian and I? We're untouchable. And we'll have the backing of everyone who wants Lorenzo gone."

"The enemy of my enemy is my friend," Don Vittorio murmured.

"Still, I respect that he's your blood," Grayson conceded. "If Lorenzo drops his obsession with Luna Audrey, I'll stop hunting him."

"And turn a blind eye to his operations?"

"Asking him to back off wasn't working. I'm trying to find middle ground." Grayson's jaw tightened. "Wolf blood spilled—good or bad—never sits right with me. I'll kill anyone who threatens my pack, but if there's a way to avoid it, I'll take it."

Don Vittorio steepled his fingers. "What do you think should happen to traitors?"

The question sent a chill down my spine. His chair creaked as he rocked back and forth, slow and deliberate. My instincts screamed that something was coming.

"Kill them." Grayson didn't blink.

"Interesting." Don Vittorio glanced at one of his men, who immediately strode to a side door. Moments later, he returned, dragging a bloodied figure by the collar. The man was forced to his knees in front of us, his head yanked back by his hair.

"I believe you know him."

"Unfortunately." My stomach twisted. Magnus looked barely alive—eyes swollen shut, nose shattered, lips split in multiple places.

"It seems he's been playing both sides."

"On my orders," Grayson admitted coolly. "There's one bond stronger than loyalty to an Alpha—the mate bond. He's mated to a woman from my pack. I assume you already knew that. I won't insult your intelligence by pretending otherwise." He shrugged. "Who am I to turn away someone willing to risk their life for me, even if they're not part of my pack?"

"I must admit, I was impressed by the trackers under his tongue," Don Vittorio said, nodding approvingly. "He never even noticed."

"I've picked up a few tricks."

Don Vittorio leaned forward, retrieving a sleek 9mm from beneath his desk. He set it down with deliberate care, his eyes locked on Magnus. "So. What should we do with him?"

"He's not one of mine," Grayson said evenly. "But I gave my word to try to keep him alive. He knew the risks, though. Honestly?" A cold smile touched his lips. "It'd be one less problem for me if you pulled that trigger. Might even be doing me a favor. But I keep my promises. The choice is yours—but is there room for negotiation?"
###Chapter 457

"Honor. I admire that quality. Under different circumstances, I might have considered doing business with you." Don Vittorio picked up the gun, turning it over in his hands with deliberate slowness.

"Without our principles, what are we?" It took every ounce of self-control to remain seated, my muscles coiled tight, resisting the urge to defend Magnus. Watching Don Vittorio decide his fate was more agonizing than I had anticipated.

"You're not wrong," he mused, "but that doesn't solve my current dilemma."

"As I said, I'm open to negotiation. But considering Magnus betrayed Lorenzo, not you personally, he should be returned to me for judgment."

Don Vittorio's sharp gaze narrowed on me. "I could always hand him back to Lorenzo."

"If that were your intention, he wouldn't be kneeling before me now… with all due respect."

He took a slow drag from his cigar, exhaling smoke as he studied me. The room was so silent I could hear the faint rustle of fabric as one of his men shifted. The gun remained in his grip, barrel lazily pointed at the ceiling.

"Traitors disgust me," he said suddenly.

In one fluid motion, he swung the gun and fired.

I forced myself not to flinch, expecting Magnus to collapse. Instead, the bodyguard behind him crumpled, clutching his stomach. Blood seeped between his fingers as he gasped. Every man in the room froze, statues in the wake of violence.

"He betrayed you?" I asked, finally glancing at the dying man. A gut shot—slow, painful.

"For some time," Don Vittorio admitted. "I kept him alive to make a point. I don’t give second chances. And as you said, Magnus hasn’t betrayed me. So, as a rare gesture of goodwill, I’ll release him to you… alive." His voice hardened. "This will never happen again. If I see him again, I won’t hesitate."

The guards shoved Magnus forward. His face hit the floor with a sickening crunch—his nose taking the brunt of the impact. I didn’t need to signal Nathan or Oliver. They hauled him up, dragging him toward the back of the room.

"Your mercy is appreciated," I said evenly. "He will answer for his actions."

Don Vittorio stubbed out his cigar, exhaling smoke as he leaned back. "I don’t doubt it. Now, let’s return to our discussion."

The wounded man groaned in pain. Without looking, Don Vittorio raised the gun and fired again—a clean shot between the eyes. "I can’t stand grown men who whine."

"Agreed." It was irritating. Maybe not execution-worthy irritating, but I wasn’t about to argue.

"Where I come from, blood binds us. One man’s problem becomes everyone’s."

"That’s the way of our world," I countered. "But how much has Lorenzo truly been part of your family? Has he ever earned this loyalty?"

"That," he said icily, "is none of your concern."

"Given that he’s never set foot in this country, and you haven’t been stateside in over a decade, I’d say no." I held his gaze. "I do my research too. My only offer is this: I’ll leave the auctions alone if Lorenzo stops targeting Audrey."

"These werewolves could benefit us all," he argued. "They’d make you stronger. What’s the harm?"

"Besides slaughtering innocent humans—which violates our laws—it means using my mate as a blood bank. Neither of which I’ll tolerate."

He waved a dismissive hand. "A vial here and there hardly qualifies."

"Do you really believe Lorenzo will stop there?"

His silence was answer enough.

"Then we’re at an impasse."

Don Vittorio shrugged, reclining in his chair. "So it seems."

Sebastian and I stood. "With all due respect, this is just business for you. Lorenzo is barely family—this is a transaction. If he wins, you gain an army to enforce your will. A new method of extraction. But for me?" My voice dropped. "This is personal. And that makes me far more dangerous. Once I walk out that door, we are enemies. I won’t stop until Lorenzo is feeding the fish. And when he inevitably betrays you? Remember this moment."

I buttoned my jacket, turning to leave.

"Alpha Grayson?"

I paused, glancing back. "Yes, Don Vittorio?"

"It was a pleasure."

"Your hospitality was… memorable."

Nathan and Oliver hauled Magnus between them as we strode out. Adrenaline burned through me, begging for release. War was coming. And Magnus had better have something useful—because now, on top of everything else, I had to save Victoria.

The stares followed us as we exited, Magnus’s limp body leaving a trail of whispers. I moved fast, my strides eating up the distance without breaking into a run. All I wanted was to get home and hold Audrey.

Sebastian’s voice cut through my thoughts. "The men spotted movement on the road ahead."

I clenched my jaw.

This wasn’t over.

###Chapter 458

"What's happening?" I gripped the steering wheel as the engine roared to life, tires tearing through the grass. "Who's out there?"

"Some of Lorenzo's men."

My foot was already pressing the gas pedal to the floor, but I wished I could push it harder. "Is Lorenzo with them?"

"No. But they recognize his men."

As Sebastian spoke, the figures emerged from the shadows—first their heads, then their torsos, and finally their legs. Not just one or two, but at least a dozen. For a split second, I considered plowing straight through them, but I didn’t want to wreck my car. "Are they armed?"

"They are." Sebastian confirmed, setting his phone down.

I slammed on the brakes, ready to break more than just bones. "Get your recorder ready," I told him before we stepped out. Sebastian hesitated for a moment before grabbing the door handle.

"Was wondering if you'd actually get out," the leader sneered as we exited the vehicle.

"What’s your name?" I demanded, my voice dripping with alpha authority. I shrugged off my jacket, and the three of us rolled up our sleeves. I just tore my shirt off entirely.

"Not your business. I’m just here to deliver a message." The guy was built like a tank, his muscles so thick his arms couldn’t even rest at his sides.

"You honestly think you can take on two alphas and their betas?" I took a step forward, itching for a fight.

"We’ve got backup." He jerked his chin toward the cars behind him, and I immediately spotted the newly turned wolves.

"Sebastian," I murmured.

A gunshot cracked through the air, and one of the wolves dropped dead. Before they could react, more shots followed, taking down the rest.

"You bastard!" The leader’s face twisted in fury.

"You thought we’d come unprepared? How stupid is Lorenzo?" I closed the distance between us, getting right in his face. "Give me a reason," I whispered.

He jabbed a finger into my chest. "Lorenzo isn’t going to like this. Your precious mate will be my plaything soon enough."

Wrong fucking answer.

I didn’t hesitate. My fist flew back, then forward with every ounce of strength I had. My men kept his crew at bay while I demolished his face. I grabbed his collar, hammering into him until his features were nothing but pulp. By the time I was done, I wasn’t even sweating—just breathing a little heavier.

But I wasn’t finished.

A dark idea crossed my mind, and a smirk curled my lips. I went to the trunk, where I kept a small emergency kit. Grabbing a pen, I scribbled on a scrap of paper:

Good luck.

After signing my name, I snatched the stapler and walked back to the unconscious man. I slapped the note onto his ruined face and stapled it to his forehead. Satisfied, I glanced around.

"Make sure Lorenzo gets this." One last look, and I was done. "Let’s go."

Thankfully, his men scrambled out of our way as we peeled out. I swerved just enough to clip one of them, leaving tire marks across the note as a final touch.

"Here." Sebastian handed me a wipe.

"Thanks." I cleaned the blood from my hands and chest.

"I’m sorry," Magnus groaned from the backseat.

"Not a fucking word from you right now."

The rest of the drive was silent. No one spoke. We didn’t stop for food. We didn’t slow down for speed limits. The roads were empty at this hour.

When we pulled into the packhouse, all I wanted was Audrey. "Take him to the hospital under guard. No one talks to him except a doctor. Remember—he’s supposed to be dead." I slammed the car door and headed straight for her.

As I reached the door, I forced myself to take a few steadying breaths. I leaned my forehead against the wood, trying to calm down.

Then the door swung open, nearly making me stumble forward. "Oh!" Audrey stood there, her hair loose, wearing nothing but one of my shirts. "Grayson? Are you okay?"

All I could do was stare into her eyes—those big, beautiful eyes filled with worry. But all I felt was rage, protectiveness, and frustration. Instead of answering, my hand slid around her neck, pulling her to me rougher than I should have. My lips crashed against hers.

For a second, I worried I was hurting her, but when she melted into me, I lost control. She stepped back as I advanced, slamming the door shut behind us. Her fingers were already working on my belt.

We didn’t talk. We didn’t mention what had just happened. We just focused on each other. I tore my shirt off her, and a soft moan escaped her lips. I needed to be inside her. I needed to feel her around me.

But Audrey had other plans.

The second my pants hit the floor, she dropped to her knees. Without breaking eye contact, her lips wrapped around me. "Fuck!" A deep growl rumbled in my chest as she worked. I braced myself against the wall to keep from buckling.

It had been too long. She was too perfect. I didn’t last. Within minutes, I came hard down her throat—but the hunger in me wasn’t satisfied.

I hauled her up, spun her around, and she immediately bent over the bed.

I didn’t know if it was the pregnancy or if she needed this just as much as I did, but she arched her back, ready for me to take her.

###Chapter 459

The morning sun streamed through my office windows as Sebastian strolled in, his presence as unwelcome as ever. "At this rate, I should just relocate my desk in here," he remarked, glancing around.

I barely spared him a look, my fingers flying over the keyboard as I drafted a mass email to our allies. Every word was deliberate—a declaration. No one laid a finger on my Luna and walked away unscathed.

"You're up early," I muttered.

Sebastian smirked. "Didn’t expect you to be awake. Figured you’d still be in bed."

I clenched my jaw. The last thing I needed was his amusement over last night’s events.

"Why are you here?"

He dropped into an armchair, stretching his legs. "Evelyn was worried. Since I refused to let her come, I got sent instead."

I hit send before finally looking at him. "Why is she worried?"

"You’re declaring war today." His tone was casual, as if discussing the weather.

"Would you do it differently?" I challenged.

"No. But you’ve got an unhealthy attachment to your sister, who happens to be pregnant."

I scoffed. "Being a twin isn’t unhealthy."

Rolling my eyes, I stood and strode out of the office. Sebastian fell into step beside me. "I wonder how the triplets will act when they’re born."

"Probably the same way we did. Are you here to help or annoy me?"

"That was Evelyn’s request. Now that I’ve fulfilled it, I can leave. She can’t get mad at me."

I shot him a glare. "What happened to your spine?"

"Your sister swallowed it last night." His grin was infuriating.

I gagged. "Disgusting."

"That’s the exact face she made."

"Fuck off." I punched his arm, my stomach churning.

A nurse spotted us and scurried over. "Alpha Grayson! How can I help?"

"A man was brought in last night. Where is he?" My tone was sharper than intended, but my patience was thin.

She hesitated, then plastered on a smile. "I wasn’t on duty last night. Let me check with the others." She bolted before I could respond.

"Charming," Sebastian muttered.

"Go home," I hissed.

Nathan’s voice cut through the tension. "Grayson. Sebastian." He nodded briskly. "This way."

He led us upstairs to a secured floor. Only one doctor and nurse had clearance. "You got to him before I could."

"Is he alive?" Part of me wished he wasn’t.

"Barely. Lost teeth, but breathing." Nathan pushed open the door. Two guards stood watch inside.

Magnus lay motionless, tubes snaking from his body, machines beeping steadily.

"What’s wrong with him?" Sebastian asked.

"Internal damage. They sedated him to heal. Another minute, and he’d be dead."

I cursed. "So he can’t tell us anything."

"Not for a week, at least. Brain swelling nearly cracked his skull."

Sebastian frowned. "How?"

"Fractures. Swelling’s pushing against them. Brain tissue’s leaking through." Nathan shrugged like it was nothing.

My phone buzzed incessantly—emails flooding in. Hopefully, allies responding to my call.

"Come on. We’ve got days to get Victoria back. Having her close might wake him up." Sebastian nudged me toward the door.

"Is Oliver coming?"

"With Evelyn and Sophia. They’re throwing a baby shower Friday before the Halloween event. All the Lunas will be there."

I groaned. "Forgot about that."

Nathan’s expression mirrored my dread. "We need to retrieve Victoria before then."

"On the bright side, more men means better security for Evelyn and Audrey."

Stepping outside, the crisp air bit at my skin, the sun blinding.

A baby shower felt trivial, but I refused to let Audrey miss out on normalcy.

"How much longer until Audrey gives birth?" Nathan asked.

"The doctor’s unsure. Pure Alpha with triplets—unprecedented. Could be any day, but likely weeks."

The only thing worse? If it happened this weekend.



###Chapter 460

This week has been absolute torture. The intel our team gathered was barely enough to go on. We’d be leaving at dawn to arrive early and scout for any suspicious activity. The old man still hadn’t answered my calls or reached out. The only lead we had—that Victoria was being sold—came from a source I wouldn’t trust with a damn thing. Tomorrow was Friday, and after that, we’d have to rush back for that ridiculous Halloween party. We wouldn’t even be here to greet the arriving Alphas and Lunas.

"Everyone clear on their roles?" I asked, scanning the room.

"I get to stay behind, play host, and miss all the action," Nathan grumbled, clearly bitter about being left out. Oliver wasn’t going either, but he’d be running security from the shadows, monitoring the new surveillance system. With so many packs attending, most of our warriors had to stay. Only Sebastian, myself, and his five black ops were heading out.

The black ops team sat in my office, going over last-minute details since I couldn’t mind-link them. "New comms," Sebastian said, handing out tiny, high-tech earpieces—no wires, just sleek, barely-there plastic.

"No issues so far," Oliver updated us. "Cameras are flawless, motion sensors pick up movement a mile out. Though the damn foxes and birds keep triggering false alarms."

"The odds of Lorenzo making a move while Sebastian and I are gone are sky-high. Stay sharp," I warned.

"A few allied packs are arriving early with extra warriors. Security won’t get tighter than this," Nathan sighed.

"And if it’s not, it’s your head," I shot back, dragging the map closer.

"With all due respect, Alpha Grayson, we’ve been staring at this for hours. We need rest before tomorrow."

He was right. My eyes burned, my back ached from hunching over, and my legs were restless. The stress was wearing me down.

"Fine. Let’s call it a night." I finally relented. The men stood, but I lingered until the room emptied before pushing myself up.

My phone buzzed as I stepped into the hall. Too exhausted to check the caller, I answered out of habit.

"Alpha Grayson."

"Ready for tomorrow?" The old man’s voice snapped me awake instantly.

"Where the hell have you been? If you want your money, act like it."

"Busy. And in case you missed it, things are dangerous here. Don Vittorio’s been scoping the place. One exit—better have a solid plan." His whisper was frantic, like he was hiding.

"Don’t worry about me. Just keep Don Vittorio distracted." Despite everything, I still respected the man. With only seven of us going, we had to be fast and precise.

"I did my part. The rest is on you." Click. He hung up before I could respond—the most infuriating informant I’d ever dealt with.

Shoving my phone back in my pocket, I entered the bedroom. Audrey was laying out her dress for tomorrow. "Love the colors," I said, shutting the door. She startled slightly but smiled.

"You think so? I wasn’t sure." Her cheeks flushed.

I cupped her face. "You okay?"

"Yeah. Just tired from walking. Tomorrow, I’ll be on the porch with Nathan. Sophia and Evelyn are joining me. Sophia’s little one will be with a sitter so we can greet everyone."

"Wish I could be here to help." Guilt gnawed at me.

Audrey sank into the chair, a pillow supporting her belly. "Don’t. Victoria needs you. She’s still pack, no matter what she did. And she did it for Magnus. Wrong way, but it’s no different than what you’d do for me."

Somehow, Audrey always put things in perspective—even if I hated admitting it. "I know. But I’ve missed so much already. Appointments, the baby shower—"

"Do you actually care about a baby shower?" She laughed. "This is the job. When it’s over, you’ll be the best dad."

"I don’t care about the shower. I care about you." I shot her a look before heading to the closet to change.

"Tell you what—I’ll open the gifts, and you can put them away later."

"Deal." The mundane offer made me smile.

"Tomorrow will go smoothly," she said as I stepped out.

"Hope so."



###Chapter 461

"I brought pastries!" One of the men called out from the rear of the vehicle. We had opted for a spacious cargo van—just in case we needed extra room beyond rescuing Victoria. Failure wasn’t an option, but I wasn’t about to turn away any other girls if the opportunity arose.

"Hell yes!" another chimed in, far too enthusiastic for the gravity of the situation.

Sebastian slid into the driver’s seat, and we set off. The moon hung high in the sky, unobscured by even a wisp of cloud. Stars glittered like scattered diamonds, casting an eerie glow over our path. The lunar energy surged through me, sharpening my focus. My wolf prowled restlessly in my mind, hungry for vengeance. We were both seething over what had been done.

The men in the back chattered like gossiping schoolgirls, but Sebastian and I remained silent. His fingers drummed against the steering wheel while I studied the map.

Only one route made sense. The others were dirt roads, and after the recent rains, they’d be a muddy nightmare. If they wanted the girls secured before anyone noticed, they’d have moved them during daylight.

The main road cut straight through the abandoned town, but my focus was on a different approach. We needed to intercept them before they arrived. Without knowing their exact path, we had to rely on educated guesses. I wanted to strike at least twenty miles before they reached the town.

Still, so much could go wrong. But the men were confident in their plan. Spike strips and explosives—cause a crash, extract Victoria, and vanish before a full-blown fight erupted. Ideally, they wouldn’t even see us coming. We had backup plans B, C, and D, just in case.

We couldn’t be more prepared for the unknown. Without intel, we were flying blind, hoping luck was on our side. I sent a silent plea to the Moon Goddess for smooth execution.

As we neared our staging area, I shot Audrey a quick text—just letting her know we’d arrived and would update her when we were heading back. Powering off my phone, I waited as Sebastian killed the engine. No one moved until I opened the door and stepped out.

"Listen up," I said, scanning the circle of faces. "This isn’t the endgame, but it’s the first battle. Saving Victoria might speed up Magnus’s recovery—and if we’re lucky, we’ll get intel. Stick to the plan. Watch each other’s backs. Everyone comes home alive. Questions?"

They absorbed every word like it might be their last. After firm handshakes, they dispersed to their positions. Two would provide cover while five of us handled the ground assault. The explosives were carefully transported into the nearby woods.

The sun blazed overhead, baking us in our black tactical gear. Sweat trickled down my back, but no one complained. This was part of training. The pile of empty water bottles in the van proved they were hydrated enough.

With no clue when the convoy would appear, all we could do was wait. Sebastian scanned the horizon with thermal binoculars—tricky in daylight, but it gave us an edge. The men murmured among themselves while I paced, my attention locked on the road.

A few cars passed—ordinary travelers, nothing suspicious. Then—

"Contact. Possible convoy inbound," a lookout murmured in my earpiece.

My pulse spiked as we scrambled into position. "Visual?" Sebastian demanded.

It was early—we’d only been waiting an hour—but if this was them, fortune was smiling on us.

"Four vehicles. All white vans. Limited visibility, but..." The lookout hesitated. "Positive ID on a passenger. It’s them." His voice firmed with certainty.

"Execute takedown," Sebastian ordered, locking eyes with me.

My fingers dug into the earth as engine noise grew louder. "Speed approximately 68 miles per hour."

"Five miles out," another lookout reported. I made a mental note to learn their names later.

"Three miles."

I glanced at the two men holding the spike strips, poised and ready. A third clutched the detonator, thumb hovering. His gaze flicked between the road and the explosives.

"Two miles."

"Aim for the lead van. Don’t trigger until they’re clear," I whispered urgently.

"One mile."

The vans materialized on the flat stretch of road, shimmering like a mirage. Closer. Closer.

"500 yards!"

"Launcher ready!" Sebastian barked.

The van roared toward us. My eyes darted between the road and the men. Timing was everything.

"Hold... hold..."

Then—

"NOW!" I shouted, thrusting my finger toward the asphalt.



###Chapter 462

"Activate the signal jammer!" The command rang out as our team sprinted toward the street. It required two men to deploy the spike strips across the asphalt, but our execution wasn't as seamless as I'd hoped.

The lead vehicle swerved violently, only catching its rear driver-side tire on the spikes. As the tire deflated, the van fishtailed but miraculously remained upright. The second van hit the strips dead center, the explosives detonating precisely as the rear tires made contact, flipping the vehicle onto its side.

Time seemed to slow as I watched the remaining two vans attempt evasive maneuvers, only to collide spectacularly.

"Grenade launcher!" Sebastian's shout snapped me back to reality as we charged toward the wreckage.

Dodging plumes of smoke, the scene resembled something from an action movie. The grenade struck the rear axle, launching the van airborne. It completed three full rotations before crashing roof-first onto the pavement. The screech of twisting metal against asphalt sent involuntary shivers through my body.

"I'll take this one!" I yelled, sprinting toward the most damaged van. Thick smoke enveloped the wreck, but the spreading pool of gasoline beneath it signaled imminent danger.

Footsteps behind me confirmed backup was coming. The rear doors were mangled beyond recognition, requiring several forceful tugs before they gave way. My teammate handled the driver's side. Inside, we found four girls chained to the walls. A quick assessment revealed only one survivor.

"GRAYSON! WE NEED TO MOVE! IT'S GONNA BLOW!" My teammate grabbed my shirt, attempting to drag me away, but I refused to abandon the girl. Though she wasn't Victoria, I wouldn't let another life be lost. The chair restraining her wouldn't yield, even to my enhanced strength.

"Forgive me," I muttered before seizing her wrist. Without hesitation, I applied crushing pressure until bones gave way, allowing me to slip her shattered hand free from the restraint.

I barely managed to grip her arm before being violently yanked backward, dragging her with me. We stumbled three paces before the explosion catapulted us through the air. Twisting mid-flight, I shielded her body with mine, absorbing the brunt of the impact.

"Grayson!" The shout reached me through the ringing in my ears. Strong hands hauled me upright and propelled me forward. My vision swam as I scanned the chaotic scene - clusters of terrified girls, Sebastian dragging a survivor by the arm, our team retrieving equipment.

Time seemed suspended until we began sprinting toward our extraction vehicle. My gaze darted between the rescued girls, desperately seeking Victoria. The world felt muffled and distant - someone supported me on one side while a girl clung to my other arm. I couldn't determine who was leading whom.

The journey back to our van passed in a haze. Suddenly, I was being tossed into the cargo area. As my shirt was torn open, sounds began filtering back through the ringing in my ears.

"We got her!"
"Apply pressure to that wound!"
"Any metal fragments?"
"I'm fine," I groaned, forcing my vision to clear.

"Where are you injured?" A familiar face loomed over me.

"Just my pride from needing your ugly mug hovering over me. Status?" I injected false steadiness into my voice.

"Grayson! I'm so sorry!" Victoria's voice flooded me with relief - quickly followed by white-hot rage.

"Mission successful. Five survivors extracted - multiple fractures and head trauma, but all stable."

"The drivers?" My attempt to sit up sent stabbing pain through my skull, exacerbated by the van's violent motion.

"All neutralized."
"Maybe overdid the explosives a bit," came the sheepish admission. I couldn't fault the results.

"Alpha Grayson, let me tend that wound." Unseen hands pressed gauze against my temple.

"This will hurt." The warning came a second before white-hot agony lanced through my abdomen, followed by crushing pressure.

"What the hell?" My enraged growl elicited whimpers from the nearby girls.

"Apologies, sir. You had a six-inch shard of van embedded in your gut."

"Keep him alive. I'm not explaining to his twin sister why he died on my watch," Sebastian barked from the front.

"He'll survive. Pissed, but breathing." As they worked, my head began clearing, leaving only a jackhammer headache. The tinnitus persisted but diminished.

"Alpha Grayson, I need to suture this now."

My eyes snapped open at the medic's declaration. The grim determination in his gaze told me everything. "Got any painkillers?"

"Negative." His blunt response drew collective winces from the van's occupants.

"Can't it wait?" Sebastian interjected.

"No. Nearest hospital is hours away, and we can't risk stopping after that operation. His alpha healing has stopped the bleeding, but improper closure will cause permanent damage."

The medic's tone brooked no argument. As the needle approached my flesh, I locked eyes with Victoria across the van, drawing strength from her terrified but grateful expression. The first stitch pierced my skin, and I welcomed the pain - each jab a reminder that we'd succeeded, that lives had been saved today. Even if it cost me every ounce of my strength, it was worth it.
###Chapter 463

Silence hung heavy in the air before someone shoved something between my teeth. "Bite down on this."

"Don't resist it if you black out," Sebastian murmured, his voice rough with tension.

I lifted my head, trying to assess the damage. The wound was deep—a jagged gash at least five inches wide. With every breath, I could see torn muscle shifting beneath the skin. This wasn't just a scratch. This was layers of flesh ripped open.

My head thudded back against the floor as I surrendered to the inevitable. Clamping my teeth around the stick, I focused on steadying my breathing. Four pairs of hands pinned my limbs down—the women moved to my front while the men held me in place.

"Ready?" Sebastian's voice was calm, detached.

I squeezed my eyes shut, tuning into the girls' soft whimpers instead. I knew he wouldn’t hold back. This had to be done right, no matter how much it hurt.

Then his fingers dug into my side.

A needle pierced my flesh.

"FUCK!" The growl tore from my throat as my jaw locked around the stick.

"Damn, he's strong," one of the guys grunted. They were straining, muscles trembling as they fought to keep me still.

Audrey’s face flashed behind my eyelids, her voice whispering for me to relax.

I obeyed without thought.

Smoke curled around me as I chased after her. She wasn’t pregnant in this vision, but she kept beckoning me forward. I ran, pushing harder, faster—but no matter how much I strained, I couldn’t catch her.

"Come," she murmured.

"I'm trying," I rasped, desperation clawing at my chest.

Then she stopped. Turned away.

The sound of crying infants replaced her voice, sending me crashing to my knees. As Audrey faded, three swaddled babies lay before me.

The first, on the right, bore a nameplate: Grayson Elijah.

Next to him was Cooper Alexander, sturdy and strong.

And then—the smallest of them all—a delicate little girl wrapped in a floral blanket. Her tag read Eliana Audrey.

My legs gave out. Tears streaked down my face as I gathered them into my arms.

First, my daughter—Audrey’s perfect mirror, so tiny, so precious.

Then my second son, the one who’d test my patience but stand unshakably loyal to those he loved.

And finally, my firstborn. The heir. The future Alpha who would lead with strength and wisdom, guiding his siblings through life.

This was my family.

But when I looked up, Audrey was gone.

Panic surged. "Audrey!" I shouted, spinning wildly, but there was nothing—just endless white fog, thickening as I ran.

Then my little girl whimpered.

Everything else faded.

I cradled her close, murmuring, "It's okay, princess. Daddy's here."

The moment her skin touched mine, she settled. Grayson cooed softly, as if telling her to sleep, and her tiny breaths evened out.

"GRAYSON!" A man’s voice boomed from somewhere distant.

I whirled, searching—but the voice slipped through my grasp, familiar yet unplaceable.

"Wake up!" Another shout.

I looked down.

My arms were empty.

The babies—gone.

Frantic, I scrabbled at the ground, but there was nothing. Then an invisible force yanked me backward.

"No! I need to find them!" I roared, but the pull was relentless.

Blinding white light seared my vision. Beeping machines shattered the silence. Hands grabbed me, prodding, pressing into my wound—

The pain returned in a vicious wave, dragging me back to reality. Victoria. The girls. The stitches.

"I'm fine!" I snarled, realizing it had all been a hallucination—a desperate escape my mind had crafted.

But was it just a dream? Or a glimpse of the future? Three children… and no Audrey?

"Grayson!" Her voice—real, electric—sent sparks racing down my arm.

My hand shot out, locking around her wrist like a lifeline. She was here. Alive. I wasn’t letting go.

Dragging her against me, I finally breathed.

Slowly, I pried my eyes open. "Lights off," Audrey commanded, sharper than I’d ever heard her.

The room dimmed. The pack doctor stood over me, inspecting the wound. "Sebastian did good work. Your healing’s already kicking in, but take it easy for a couple days."

"Thank you," Audrey said softly.

Movement flickered at my side.

"How do you feel?" Sebastian asked.

Scarlett clung to his arm, her worried gaze fixed on me.
###Chapter 464

"What's the update?" I demanded, gritting my teeth as I attempted to sit up. A searing pain shot through my side, making me wince, but I refused to stay lying down any longer. Audrey pressed a button, adjusting the bed to prop me upright.

"We have Victoria. She's upstairs with Magnus. His condition is already improving. She has minor bruising and a few fractures, but overall, she’ll recover. She was in the third vehicle—the one that crashed into the second van. I managed to pull her out just as I saw you barely escape before the explosion. The girl will live, though she’ll never regain full use of her hand after you shattered every bone in it. Still, she’s alive. In total, we rescued five girls. The others didn’t make it, and the drivers… well, they’re dead now. The problem? One of them bore the mark of the Italian mafia on his chest. We don’t know if he was Don Vittorio’s man or not, but he died in the wreck—not by our hands."

"That won’t matter to him." I leaned back, disappointment creeping in as I instinctively reached for my babies, only to remember they weren’t there. Logically, I knew it was just a vision, but the longing was real.

"Didn’t think so. We made it back in time for the welcome banquet. I can take over if you’re not up for it. Everyone would understand—most of them saw you being rushed into the hospital."

"Fantastic," I muttered sarcastically. "No, I’m going." Pure stubbornness fueled my words.

"Grayson, just rest—" Scarlett began.

"Evelyn, you didn’t rest when it was you in this position. Why would I? These men came as our allies. Staying in bed would only make me look weak. After declaring war, it’s a terrible look for me to hide away and expect them to pick up the slack. No, I have to be at that dinner."

She frowned but nodded. "You have an hour to get ready and meet everyone in the grand hall," Sebastian said, already guiding Scarlett out of the room.

"Next time, it’s your turn to get hurt," I groaned as I forced myself upright.

"Nah, that’s all on you. Besides, you don’t even know who you saved, do you?"

That caught me off guard. I shot him a questioning look. "No. Who was it?"

"Alpha Donovan’s daughter."

I stiffened. "What?" Alpha Donovan ruled the Midwest. He’d once held the title of the most powerful Alpha—until Sebastian and I took it from him by killing Damian. The only reason we were considered stronger now was because Sebastian’s mate was my twin sister. Most saw our packs as one.

"Apparently, they thought she’d run away. Turns out, Dominic kidnapped her for her blood. She’s been his personal blood bank for the past year. He was only selling her now because she hadn’t found her mate, and her blood was losing its potency."

"Damn." Shaking my head, I glanced back at Audrey as Sebastian and Scarlett left. A nurse entered, holding a syringe.

"Antibiotics," she chirped, far too cheerful for my mood. Biting back a retort, I let her jab the needle into my arm before she turned to leave. "Alpha Grayson, Luna Audrey. Let me know if you need anything else."

The door clicked shut, leaving us alone. "Where did you go?" Audrey asked, stepping aside so I could stand.

Pain flared in my side, but once I was up, I managed. My shirt was gone—vaguely, I remembered it being torn off—leaving my fresh wound exposed.

"What do you mean?" I took her hand as we slowly made our way out.

"You kept asking where your babies were," she said through the mind-link.

"I passed out. Had a vision. Our three children were there."

"You were radiating so much love it nearly suffocated me." She smiled as we reached the golf cart she’d used to bring me here.

"Can’t wait to meet them and see if they look like what I saw." It took me a moment to settle behind the wheel before driving back to the packhouse. Women clustered in groups, chatting, while the men stood on the porch, amber-colored drinks in hand.

"Alpha Grayson!" a woman shrieked as we pulled up. Conversations halted as all eyes turned to me. I kept my head high, refusing to show any weakness as I stepped off the cart. Audrey waited for me to offer her a hand before we approached the crowd. "How are you feeling? That wound looks terrible!"

I didn’t recognize most of the mates—it had been years since I’d seen them in person. The Alphas I knew, but not their partners. "Much better, thank you. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to clean up before enjoying the feast!"

Audrey kept her hand in mine as we ascended the stairs. Every step sent a sharp jolt of pain through my side. "Alpha Grayson."

I recognized Alpha Donovan immediately as he stepped forward. "Alpha Donovan. Thank you for coming." He waited until I reached the top before extending his hand.

"Thank you for saving my daughter. We owe you a life debt. Standing with you in this war will be my honor." He was as old as my father, and his daughter was his sole heir.
###Chapter 465

"It was my privilege to save her, and it will be my honor to fight by your side. My father always spoke highly of you. You were one of his closest friends."

Alpha Blackwood placed his hand on my shoulder, his grip firm and reassuring. He didn’t say a word—just nodded, allowing me to pass into the house. That simple gesture, so much like my father’s, made my chest tighten. For years, I’d told myself I didn’t need him. But now, standing here, I realized just how much I missed him.

"Audrey, is it safe to shower with this?" I asked, gesturing to the bandage covering my wound as we stepped into our room. She had already laid out my suit for dinner, her own dress—a soft blush pink—hanging on the closet door. Even though the event wasn’t formal, tradition dictated the hosts dress a little more elegantly than the rest.

"It shouldn’t soak, and don’t put soap directly on it, but otherwise, you’ll be fine."

"Stay with me while I get ready?" I phrased it as a request, but the truth was, I didn’t want her out of my sight. That nightmare—or vision, whatever it was—had shaken me to my core. I’d always known she was in danger, but I’d never let myself imagine a world without her.

"Okay?" She agreed, though I caught the flicker of surprise in her eyes. "I’ll just do my makeup in here."

She gathered her cosmetics without another word, settling at the vanity while I turned on the shower. I kept the water cool—partly to keep the mirror from fogging, partly to keep my wound from bleeding again.

"How was your day?" I asked as I reached for the shampoo. Rust-colored water swirled down the drain, washing away the dried blood.

"Good. I spent most of it on the porch. We got lucky with the weather—low 70s, a light breeze. No one let me lift a finger." She grinned. "Did you see all the gifts stacked against the wall?"

"I didn’t, but I wasn’t looking. Anything stand out?"

"You’ll have to see for yourself! I love everything." Her voice was bright with excitement.

I turned off the water and grabbed a towel, watching as she applied a soft pink gloss to her lips. I didn’t know the difference between gloss and whatever else existed, but that shade was my favorite.

"That color looks amazing on you."

She pursed her lips playfully, striking a little pose. "You think so?"

"I know so." I cupped her chin, leaning in for a kiss, but she turned her head away.

"Don’t ruin it!"

Undeterred, I pressed my lips to her neck instead. "Better?"

"Hmm, not sure yet." She shot me a teasing look as I laughed. Giving her a light swat on the backside, I left the bathroom to finish dressing.

Audrey sat at the vanity, curling her hair, while I struggled into my shirt. Moving my arms hurt, but I managed, swallowing a couple of painkillers to take the edge off.

Just as I finished buttoning up, she stood. "Can you help me with my dress?"

"Of course."

She stepped into the blush-pink gown, the stretchy mermaid-style fabric hugging her curves perfectly. The sweetheart neckline flowed into off-the-shoulder sleeves, the cuffs delicate and elegant. With her hair cascading in loose curls, she looked breathtaking.

"Where did you get this dress? It’s stunning." I fastened my watch as she moved toward the mountain of gifts.

She hadn’t been exaggerating—the pile was enormous. "Clothes, blankets, and look at these!" She held up the tiniest pair of baby slippers, cotton and impossibly small.

I took them, smiling. "These are adorable."

"I tried sorting everything, but we’ll need to remove the tags and have the staff wash them all." She sifted through the bags until a knock sounded at the door. "I’ll get it!" she called, practically bouncing with excitement.

I was about to ask who it was when my gaze landed on a particular package—sage green with a floral pattern. Something about it made my pulse stutter. Setting the slippers down, I reached for it, pulling out three blankets. The fabric was identical to what I’d seen in my vision. The floral design matched perfectly. Elijah’s had dark blue mountains, Cooper’s had phases of the moon.

"Grayson?" Audrey’s hand touched my arm, pulling me back.

"Who gave us these?" My voice was rough with emotion. I barely registered our guest, my focus locked on her.

Confusion flickered in her eyes as she bit her lip. "I’m not sure…" She rifled through a bag and pulled out a notepad. "We wrote everything down."

"What’s wrong?" Scarlett stepped closer, eyeing the blankets. "Those are cute."

"Audrey, I don’t see who sent these."

"There’s a card," Scarlett said, pulling one out—but it was unsigned.



###Chapter 466

"You know, we received so many gifts that I can't even recall who gave us those particular ones." I traced my fingers over the delicate fabric. "I remember unwrapping them, though. Is there something wrong with them? We chose these patterns ourselves."

That caught me off guard. Could it really be that simple? Had my subconscious remembered these designs and dressed the babies in them? "I must have forgotten we picked these out. I just...really loved them."

I wasn't entirely convinced, but now wasn't the moment to dwell on it. "You took quite a hit to the head. Are you feeling alright?" Scarlett asked, slipping her arm through Sebastian's but keeping her gaze fixed on me with an odd intensity.

"Never better," I lied, forcing a smile that she saw right through. Wrapping my arm around Audrey, we moved ahead. Audrey looked stunning, though her waddling gait slowed us down.

Soft melodies floated through the grand foyer. The dimmed lights cast a warm glow, and laughter echoed gently against the walls. The atmosphere was effortlessly elegant yet relaxed.

Nathan approached as we entered. "Everything's secure. No disturbances all day. Four men are monitoring the cameras, plus extra guards. Just relax and enjoy yourself tonight."

"Where's Sophia?" Audrey asked.

Nathan's usual stern demeanor softened instantly at her question. "At the head table."

"I should go sit down," Audrey told me.

"I'll join her," Scarlett said, releasing Sebastian's arm to take Audrey's from me.

I wanted her to stay by my side, but I knew that wasn't realistic. Instead, I kept our mind-link wide open. "I want eyes on them at all times," I said, sharper than intended.

"Already handled." Nathan showed me a small screen—similar to a baby monitor, but this one tracked Audrey's every move. "I slipped trackers into all the women's dress hems. As long as she stays in this room, she's covered. Even in the restroom—not the stalls, just the sinks. I'm not a creep."

"Here you go." Oliver appeared with two drinks—bourbon for Sebastian and me. The rich aroma filled my nose as I took a sip.

"Everyone, please take your seats!" The sound technician's voice boomed through the room. We made our way to our table as the crowd settled into silence.

A server stood beside my chair, holding a microphone. Audrey rose next to me as I took it. "Thank you all for coming tonight."

Cheers erupted, applause ringing out until I lowered the mic, waiting for the noise to die down. Audrey looped her arm through mine for balance, shifting her weight carefully.

"We're gathered for several reasons tonight. First, to celebrate the future heirs of the Crimson Fang Pack and the Silvercrest Pack!" The cheers grew louder, and I felt Audrey's emotions swell under the attention. "And let's not forget how radiant Luna Evelyn and Luna Audrey look tonight!" I nearly said Alpha Audrey, but the title still made her uneasy.

"Thank you," Audrey murmured as I held the mic to her lips.

"Tomorrow is the Halloween gala. Luna Audrey, Luna Evelyn, Beta Sophia, and their team have worked tirelessly to bring this event to life. Please excuse any chaos as preparations unfold. Cocktail hour begins at 4 PM, followed by a themed dinner. Lunas, there will be a garden luncheon—weather permitting. Alphas, a strategy meeting will be held in the formal dining room at noon. All other guests are welcome to dine in our restaurants or here in this hall." I paused, scanning the room. "Lastly, I want to personally thank everyone who has responded to my declaration of war. Details will be shared at tomorrow’s meeting. For now, let’s enjoy tonight—an exquisite meal, followed by dancing."

Another round of cheers erupted as servers brought out the first course. Audrey had chosen a crispy chicken salad—beef hadn’t been sitting well with her lately—while I savored the Beef Wellington.

As we ate, my eyes never stopped moving. Six alphas, their mates, and their betas filled the room, each with their own security and warriors ready for battle.

"This turned out beautifully," Audrey said, finishing her salad.

"You did an incredible job planning it. I’m sorry I wasn’t more involved."

"You were where you needed to be." She rested her hand on my forearm.

I swallowed my last bite, leaning back and draping an arm over her chair, pulling her close. She nestled against me as I sipped my drink.

"Have you spoken to Vivienne or Xavier?" I asked, catching myself before saying your parents.

"Xavier’s nearly healed, and Vivienne is...Vivienne. I ordered them to stay home this weekend. The last thing we need is them stirring drama among the alphas. What you choose to share with them is your call."

I was surprised by her decisiveness but didn’t argue. "Did something happen?"
###Chapter 467

"Nothing specific. Vivienne keeps drifting back to memories of her and Xavier's youth." I adjusted the pillow behind my back, wincing at the lingering pain from my injuries. "I can't tell if she's simply reminiscing or genuinely reliving those moments. Some of the things she says... they're unsettling. I'm beginning to suspect permanent brain trauma from everything she endured."

Sebastian studied me, his sharp gaze assessing. "But is she happy?"

I blinked. "What do you mean?"

"Is she happy?" he repeated, slower this time.

I reached for my water glass, the condensation cool against my fingertips. "I suppose so. Why?"

"If she isn't harming anyone, let her be." He leaned back, stretching his legs. "Eighteen years in a cage would break anyone. Frankly, I'd be shocked if she didn't have lasting scars. Indulging her memories costs nothing."

Silence stretched between us. The clatter of dishes being cleared filled the space as guests began dispersing. "I never expected anything from her," I admitted finally. "It's not like I need a mother."

Sebastian's expression softened. "Accept her as she is. This small happiness might bring you peace too. Any connection with her is a gift."

I knew he was right. Even if our relationship would never be conventional, having Vivienne in my life—however fragmented—was better than nothing.

"And Xavier?" I challenged, unable to resist. A smirk tugged at my lips. I already knew his answer.

Sebastian rolled his eyes. "When he isn't being an insufferable ass, he's tolerable." He took a deliberate sip of his drink. "Though, to be fair, he's never truly been part of this pack."

Around us, the ballroom emptied. Servants whisked away plates, their movements efficient. "I'm calling it a night," I announced, pushing back my chair.

Sebastian stood to help me up. "You sure?"

"Yeah. I've hit my limit." The weight of the evening pressed against my ribs. "I just want to lie down."

"I've got her." Nathan materialized behind me, his hand warm against my elbow.

"Alright. I won't be far behind." Sebastian pressed a kiss to my temple before Nathan guided me toward the exit.

Sebastian watched us go, his gaze lingering until the doors swung shut behind us.

The hallway stretched quiet, our footsteps muffled by the plush carpet. Nathan's grip was steady, his presence a silent reassurance.

Upstairs, Sophia was just leaving our suite. "Oh! Sorry, Grayson!"

"You're fine. Did Audrey need help?"

"Yeah, her dress zipper was stuck. She didn’t want to bother you, so I stepped in." Sophia adjusted the strap of her bag. "We’re heading out, so it was quick."

"Thanks. See you tomorrow."

Inside, the soft rush of water led me to the bathroom. Audrey stood at the sink, dressed in one of Grayson’s shirts, wiping away the evening’s makeup.

"Didn’t expect you back so soon," she said without turning.

"How’d you know it was me?" I leaned against the doorframe, crossing my arms.

She smirked in the mirror. "Your footsteps. They’re distinct."

"Are they?"

"Mmhmm." She splashed water on her face, then reached for a towel. The ritual of her nighttime routine unfolded—serums, creams, layers of products I’d never understand. Men didn’t need half this effort, yet her skin was always softer.

"I’ll queue up a movie," I offered.

"Perfect."

By the time she emerged, I’d swapped my suit for sweatpants and queued Halloween. "Really?" She arched a brow.

"What? It’s seasonally appropriate."

"Sure." She laughed, settling into the nest of pillows she’d built. There was barely space left for me.

"Thought it’d be fun." I killed the lights and wedged myself beside her.

Audrey laced her fingers through mine. Within minutes, her breathing evened out. The movie played on, but my eyelids grew heavy.

Instead of Michael Myers, my dreams filled with three tiny faces, their laughter brighter than any nightmare.



###Chapter 468

"Oh perfect, you're already here." Nathan strolled into my office without knocking, the door wide open.

"Where else would I be?" I didn't glance up, too busy organizing the documents and photos for the upcoming meeting.

Nathan wore dark-wash jeans paired with a fitted slate-gray polo—thankfully not black like mine. My own outfit consisted of black skinny jeans, boots, and a matching polo. Some of the older alphas might call it a "young wolf's style," but comfort mattered more than their opinions.

"Figured you'd still be in bed, nursing those wounds." His tone was light, teasing, but my nerves were too frayed for laughter.

"Actually, I feel great today." After a final check of my folder, I stood and adjusted my shirt. "How long till the meeting starts?"

Nathan glanced at his watch. "Four minutes."

"Damn." I brushed past him, heading out of my office. "Is Sebastian here yet?"

Over my shoulder, I caught Nathan shoving his hands into his pockets as he followed.

"Already inside. Sent me to fetch you."

"Why didn’t he come himself?" Irritation flickered in my voice.

"Busy chatting with Alpha Cyrus."

Six other alphas would be joining us. Four were around our age or slightly older, having taken over after their fathers retired or died. Only two remained from the original alliance my father had formed decades ago.

Alpha Donovan and Alpha Cyrus were in their late fifties, though Cyrus refused to age gracefully, dyeing his hair an unnatural dark brown. Both were built like warriors, their arms sleeved in ink.

Alpha Cyrus was a natural blonde, his freckled face so youthful he'd inked a serpent across his chest and cheek to appear more intimidating. His gym obsession had turned him into a brute in record time—Nathan and I often joked about possible "enhancements."

Alpha Silas was the closest to Sebastian and me in demeanor. Towering at 6'7" with jet-black hair and golden eyes, he had no trouble attracting women—until he opened his mouth. His arrogance was legendary, yet somehow, he never left a club alone.

Alpha Tobias and Alpha Matteo were seven years my senior, having led their packs for a decade without needing to call a full gathering. Tobias, the shortest at 6'1", was lean but lethal, trained in every martial art imaginable. Matteo, blond with unsettling black eyes, had covered his freckled face with a neck tattoo to look tougher. His temper made him my least favorite to work with.

"Alpha Grayson!" Silas grinned as I entered the room.

"Since when do we use titles?" I extended a hand, which he shook before pulling me into a rough hug.

"Just messing with you." He laughed, tossing his head back. "How’s the injury?"

"Yeah, you were leaking like a faucet," Sebastian added, joining us with Cyrus.

"Better. Just stiff."

"He had a chunk of muscle dangling," Sebastian supplied unhelpfully.

"Disgusting." Silas wrinkled his nose.

"Badass," Matteo countered. The others fell silent, gathering around.

"Not my favorite wound, but far from the worst." I moved to the table, the rest following as we took our seats.

"Starving," Cyrus groaned as servers brought out medium-rare steaks, garlic mashed potatoes, and roasted asparagus.

"Same." Silas stabbed a spear of asparagus, chewing with exaggerated pleasure.

"Thank the Moon you didn’t do some dainty brunch like the women. This might be my last meal before the party," Donovan remarked, cutting into his steak with refined precision.

"Audrey handled all of it. Planned and executed flawlessly." I wouldn’t let her efforts go unnoticed.

"Where’ve you been?" Matteo challenged.

"Busy trying to kill Lorenzo and keep her alive." My tone sharpened, matching my annoyance.

"Obviously. Did you even read his update?" Silas shot Matteo a glare.

"I read it!" Matteo bristled. "It was a joke."

"A shit one. He’s risked his life more in the past month than anyone here—except maybe Sebastian." Silas dared him to argue.

"Enough." Donovan’s disapproving stare silenced everyone. Even Matteo knew better than to push back.

"We took down Alpha Damian and Dominic with minimal losses, but recent developments demand reinforcements. Sebastian and I have mobilized our men, but we’ve also taken hits. As you know, I declared war after speaking with Lorenzo’s uncle."

"Remind me—who is his uncle again?" Cyrus asked.

"I’ll recap everything." I took a bite of steak, set down my fork, and braced for the inevitable criticism.

###Chapter 469

"I'll summarize most of it, but I'll cover everything." I wasn't entirely sure I remembered every detail. Some parts seemed trivial now, almost insignificant.

"If there are gaps, I'm sure Sebastian can help fill them in." Anthony leaned back, arms crossed over his chest. His words ignited a spark of fury in me, but it was Sebastian who responded first.

"Let me assure you, Grayson remembers every single moment his mate was in danger." While Anthony lounged, Sebastian sat forward, his gaze challenging.

"Grayson, go on." Cyrus gave Anthony a sharp look before nodding at me.

"My beta, Nathan, found his mate. Cassandra had a mate before, but he passed away, and she was blessed with a second chance. That detail matters because her sister was one of the women we rescued when we took down Alpha Damian."

I paused, letting the weight of that sink in.

"Seraphina started revealing Cassandra’s secrets, exposing the hidden threat against Audrey. Her past isn’t for discussion—I’ve heard it, but none of you have the right to know it." My gaze swept the room, lingering pointedly on Anthony before I continued.

"Seraphina told us Magnus was a high-ranking wolf, but he and Raphael escaped before the final battle. Raphael was working with Dominic. Later, we discovered they were taking women to a secluded house, experimenting on their blood. Worse, they were targeting high-ranking females—"

"—like my daughter," Alpha Cyrus cut in, his voice tight.

"What the hell did they need their blood for?" Cyrus demanded. By now, every man at the table was leaning forward, elbows planted firmly on the surface.

"They created a potion—or at least, that’s what they called it. A concoction given to humans that strips away their humanity and turns them into werewolves. According to them, only the blood of high-ranking females made the transformation successful."

"They were experimenting on humans?" Alpha Cyrus looked horrified.

"Dominic and Raphael. They had a hidden facility in the woods. We raided it, found corpses, and burned it to the ground. Here’s the evidence." I slid folders across the table, each containing gruesome photos.

"The fortress you see in those images is Ravenstone Keep—Raphael’s stronghold. It’s probably in ruins now. We found it and made sure it wouldn’t be used again. Unfortunately, Raphael escaped. Security details are labeled in the report, but those specifics aren’t crucial to the bigger picture."

"Who are these two?" Oliver held up a photo of Victoria and Magnus.

"Victoria is my ex. That’s her mate, Magnus."

Every pair of eyes locked onto me. "Seriously?" Donovan’s jaw dropped.

"Met at a bar. Anyway, she was trying to save Magnus by breaking into my office to steal documents. We came up with a plan—fake their deaths, make it look like I botched their medication. Dumped their bodies where Raphael would find them as a twisted message. It worked… for a while. But they were eventually discovered. I’d planted trackers under their tongues. Magnus is fighting for his life in my hospital under guard. Victoria was just rescued from being sold. That’s how I got this." I gestured to the wound at my side. "The van exploded as I was pulling Cyrus’s daughter out."

"Damn," Cyrus muttered. "You’ve been handling hell on your own. Why didn’t you call for backup sooner?"

"Because we were hoping to avoid an all-out war," I admitted, exhaling heavily.

"Who’s this?" Anthony held up another photo, and my stomach twisted. I’d hoped we wouldn’t have to go there.

"That’s Xavier. Audrey’s father."

"With all due respect, what’s the story there? She’s an Alpha?"

"That’s exactly why Raphael is fixated on Audrey." I dragged a hand through my hair, shifting uncomfortably before continuing. "Audrey’s mother was Vivienne. Daughter of Alpha John and rightful heir to his title. She had Audrey with Xavier before she was mated to Alpha Damian—"

"Wait, so she and Dominic were half-siblings?" Donovan looked stunned.

"Yes. Dominic wanted her dead to claim the title. He planned to mate with Kristen to produce strong-blooded daughters, but since he’s gone, Raphael has turned his attention to Audrey. She’s a true Alpha, though she prefers her role as Luna here. I think she wants to sever ties with that pack. Her blood would create the most potent potion—capable of turning humans into werewolves."

"I feel like I’m missing something," Cyrus said slowly. "Between you and Sebastian, you have the numbers and the power. Why involve us?"

"Because Raphael has an uncle in the picture now. This could escalate beyond us."

"Who?" Donovan frowned.

Anthony tossed the photos down in frustration. "You two lead the strongest packs. Who the hell is bigger than you?"

"Ever heard of Don Vittorio Romano?" I asked the table.

Eyebrows furrowed as they wracked their brains. "That’s not a local name," Cyrus muttered.

"Not even close," I confirmed.

"That’s Italian…" Cyrus finally realized.

"Correct. Don Vittorio Romano is the head of the Italian Mafia—and Raphael’s uncle."

Silence. Absolute, suffocating silence.

No one moved. No one breathed.

Only Sebastian and I sat back, letting them absorb the gravity of it.

"The mafia is involved?" Cyrus whispered, disbelief thick in his voice.



###Chapter 470

"They are. Not sure how many or what they're capable of. Sebastian and I had a meeting with Don Vittorio..."

"You what? You just called up the head of the mafia and asked to meet him? How the hell did you even get his number?" Nathan demanded, his voice sharp with disbelief.

"Nathan, I swear to the Moon Goddess, I will silence you myself in about three seconds." Grayson's glare was lethal. To his credit, Nathan actually shut his mouth. Grayson waited a beat before turning back to me. "Go on."

"My informant was killed. Still don’t know why or by whom. There’s an old man who runs the underground auctions. Theodore used to pay him a fortune to keep things... favorable. Since he’s dead, Lorenzo hasn’t kept up the payments. In fact, he’s bullied and pissed the old man off."

I took a breath. "At one point, I was tailing Magnus and stumbled into one of their locations. So, I reached out to the old man and offered to pay him for intel on auction dates and any other useful information. Lorenzo has burned a lot of bridges with former allies. The old man tipped me off about Victoria being sold. Sebastian had an undercover operative who got close enough that the number was airdropped to his phone. So yeah, technically, I did just call Don Vittorio. Looked up the protocol, requested a meeting with a few conditions. He held up his end—it was civil. At the end, he said he’d stand by Lorenzo because these wolves would increase his power. I told him I was declaring war and that Lorenzo was a dead man. We shook hands and basically said may the best man win."

It wasn’t verbatim, but that was the gist.

"Fuck." Donovan dropped the photos and dragged his hands through his hair.

"Yeah. I declared war, and I can’t tell you how many men he has, but the longer we wait, the more will show up. I made my intentions crystal clear, and so did he. The problem is, we don’t know where they’re hiding. We poisoned the air system at Ravenstone Keep, so aside from the bodies, they could be anywhere."

"So they want to kill Audrey for her blood." Cyrus was still processing.

"No, they don’t." My voice darkened, and everyone turned to me.

When I didn’t elaborate, Sebastian stepped in. "They want to keep her hostage for a continuous blood supply. They want the babies raised under their control—for their blood."

Cyrus looked like he might be sick. "That’s the most twisted thing I’ve ever heard."

My jaw clenched so hard I could hear my teeth grinding. "It’s not happening."

"What do you need from us?" Grayson asked, shutting his folder.

"I’m not entirely sure, given I’ve never gone up against the mafia before."

Nathan stood and started pacing. "I didn’t even know the mafia was run by wolves!"

"Neither did I—until we saw him."

"Have you heard from the old man since you rescued Victoria and my daughter?" Grayson’s tone suggested he was already forming a plan.

"No. Didn’t expect to. The auction was a bust since none of the girls made it there. This might turn into a full-blown war between me and the mafia. No evidence Theodore’s allies are even siding with Lorenzo, but they were definitely interested in the human-wolves."

"We need to find where they’re keeping the captured girls. Do you have someone who can track missing high-ranking women? They’d have to be from all over—otherwise, we’d have heard about more disappearances." Grayson was already strategizing.

"That should be our first move. Find their source and cut it off." Donovan agreed.

"I’ve got a guy who can handle the research." Cyrus pulled out his phone and started scrolling. "Young, but freakishly good."

Nathan gripped the back of his chair and leaned forward. "What about sending in an undercover team?"

"I’ve got Enzo. He’s small, and so is his wolf, but he’s one of my best. He’s been with us through all of this. His wolf blends in with actual wild packs. If anyone else has members who can run with him, that’d help. We can send a team, but we need to know where first." Sebastian’s voice was firm. "I’m not sending men out blind."

"Have you questioned Seraphina yet?" Grayson asked.

"We did early on, but not since all this escalated. She didn’t give us much before." I’d almost forgotten about her.

"If it’s alright with you, I’d like to review all these reports thoroughly. Then I want to question Seraphina and everyone involved—no matter how minor their role seems."

"No problem. My Beta might object, but I’ll handle him. Fresh eyes might help. At this point, I’m not sure if I’ve missed anything."

"I don’t think we’ve missed anything, and I’ve had people analyzing this who aren’t emotionally invested." Sebastian’s admission surprised me. I couldn’t blame him, but it still stung a little that he hadn’t told me.

"We should break for today. The party’s in a few hours. That’ll give me time to go over everything and regroup. Hopefully, we can question everyone tomorrow and have a plan before the weekend’s over." Grayson stood, gathering his papers.

"Sounds good. I need time too. Your notes are thorough—they’ll help get us up to speed." Cyrus followed Grayson’s lead.

"Alright. Meeting adjourned." I exhaled, some of the weight lifting off my shoulders.



###Chapter 471

The scalding water had been cascading down my spine for nearly half an hour. My palms pressed against the tiled wall, I let the heat soothe the tension coiled in my muscles. Every decision I'd made recently had been scrutinized, dissected, and debated—it was exhausting.

I replayed each choice in my mind, second-guessing myself despite knowing I'd acted with my pack's best interests at heart. I wouldn't—couldn't—stand by and do nothing when my family was at risk. But that didn’t mean doubt didn’t creep in.

Only when the water turned icy did I finally shut it off. One advantage of the pack house over my own home? Unlimited hot water. No rationing here.

The bathroom door creaked open as I toweled off. "How did the meeting go?" Audrey leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed over her chest.

"It went... well, I think." I rubbed the towel over my damp hair. "They're reviewing everything. We'll reconvene tomorrow. Hopefully, a few will confirm their support tonight."

"Are some of them hesitant?"

"Not exactly. Maybe Damian, but the rest just want to be fully briefed. They’ll want to question Seraphina, Cassandra, and probably Xavier." I sighed. "Part of me hopes they agree with my calls. The other part hopes they spot something I missed."

"Why?" She stepped aside as I moved toward the bedroom, where my costume lay sprawled across the bed.

"Because if they find another angle, we’ll have more options. But I also want to believe I didn’t overlook anything—that I handled it exactly as they would have."

The last thing I wanted was to slip into that ridiculous robe, but Audrey had already done her hair and makeup. I wouldn’t ruin this for her. Still, she had to sense my reluctance. A party was the last thing on my mind—not that I had a choice.

"You did what you thought was right in the moment," she said softly. "Everyone questions themselves afterward. It’s human."

Her words were meant to comfort, but they didn’t ease the weight in my chest.

"Ready to go?" I avoided her gaze as I yanked on a pair of shorts and a tank top before grabbing the robe.

"Almost. Just need help with my wrap."

After adjusting her robe, I fastened the necklace around my throat. "Did you get your belly painted?"

Audrey grinned and parted her robe. A stunning depiction of Earth adorned her swollen belly. "What do you think?"

"That’s incredible. Who did it?"

"Kris." She let the robe fall back into place and pulled out pieces of her costume. I raised a brow at how much skin she was showing, but I was proud of her confidence. The top was little more than an embellished bra, zipped up the back. The skirt clung to her hips before flaring out into a flowing train. The white linen fabric and the greenery woven into her hair gave her an ethereal, moonlit glow.

"You look amazing," I said, forcing a smile.

"Thanks." She eyed me before handing over my oversized cane. "Ready?"

I nodded, following her downstairs to the car.

The drive took an hour, filled with comfortable silence. Audrey tapped away on her phone while I lost myself in thought.

Finding the missing girls was the next step. With the right allies, we could dismantle the entire operation. Take down the corrupt Alphas who ran their packs like Damian had.

It was a long shot, but worth proposing.

I barely noticed when we arrived, lost in strategy.

"This place is packed already!" Audrey’s voice snapped me back to reality.

She wasn’t wrong. The valet line stretched endlessly, and the venue pulsed with purple, orange, and red lights. Jack-o'-lanterns lined the entrance, their flickering grins casting eerie shadows. The thump of monster-themed music vibrated through the windows as we pulled up.

"Alpha Grayson." A warrior greeted me, opening my door.

"Thanks." I rounded the car to help Audrey out, her belly making the maneuver tricky. Despite her discomfort, she beamed as we stepped inside.

The interior was bathed in dim, moody lighting, with purple and crimson hues dancing across the walls. Guests mingled, laughter blending with the music.

"This turned out perfect!" Audrey gushed.

"Is there dinner?" I realized I hadn’t paid attention to the event details.

"Just hors d'oeuvres being passed around. There’s a small buffet and a drink station. You’ll give a quick speech, but otherwise, it’s all about mingling." She smirked. "Perfect for allies to relax and maybe find a mate or two."
###Chapter 472

"You all look absolutely stunning!" I couldn't help but admire them as we approached the head table. Greetings poured in from every direction—some familiar faces, others obscured by elaborate masks. With the guest list including everyone over eighteen, I didn't bother trying to identify them all. I only recognized the highest-ranking members.

"Looking sharp!" Scarlett's voice snapped me out of my thoughts, pulling my attention away from the DJ, who looked like he'd stepped out of a mad scientist's lab.

"Thanks!" Audrey struck a pose, accentuating her baby bump with a playful yet sultry stance.

"That shirt is... something else." I bit back a laugh as I took in Sebastian's outfit—a silky brown shirt adorned with vibrant orange and pink flowers, paired with flared velvet pants that completed the ensemble. Scarlett had gone all out too, her stomach covered in shimmering rhinestones. I didn't even want to imagine how long it had taken to apply them—or worse, how long it would take to remove them.

"Kiss my ass," Sebastian grumbled.

"Come on! Sophia's waiting for us!" Scarlett grabbed Audrey's hand, and the two of them disappeared into the crowd, leaving Sebastian and me alone.

"You should try the severed fingers," he suggested casually.

I blinked. "What else is on the menu?"

"No idea."

The flow of guests had slowed to a trickle. We stood in comfortable silence, observing the lively mingling around us. Laughter filled the air, though one group of guys seemed to be getting a little too rowdy—until the warriors swiftly intervened.

My gaze landed on Audrey as she made her way back toward us. "It's time for your welcome speech," she announced.

"Got it." The DJ approached, handing me a microphone.

"I'll lower the music, then it's all yours," he said before retreating to his booth. The moment the music faded, he gave me a nod.

"Welcome, everyone!" My voice rang out clearly, and the room fell silent instantly, all eyes turning toward me. "We're incredibly grateful you could join us tonight. May this gathering bring new mates and lasting friendships. Food and drinks are available at the tables, and staff will be circulating with additional offerings. Enjoy yourselves!"

The crowd erupted in cheers as I returned the microphone. The music swelled again, and the atmosphere shifted back to one of laughter and celebration. Setting the mic aside, Sebastian and I watched as the girls vanished into the crowd.

"Nathan, is security on high alert? Cameras on Audrey?" I asked through the mind-link. I hadn't spotted him yet and needed verbal confirmation.

"Roger," came his clipped reply.

I was about to respond when I caught sight of him approaching from the corner of my eye. "Everything's secure. Just finished my rounds."

"Good. If anything happens, it's your head."

I studied Nathan closely. If not for his fangs, I wouldn’t have recognized him. That meant Sophia probably had a fake bite mark on her neck, complete with theatrical blood. "All clear. Enjoy the night."

"Alpha Grayson." Cyrus's voice drew my attention. He was dressed in tights—likely playing Robin Hood, with his Luna as Maid Marian.

"Alpha Cyrus." I shook his offered hand. "This is my Beta, Nathan."

"Pleasure to meet you," Cyrus said, extending his hand to Nathan.

"The honor is mine, Alpha Cyrus." Nathan's demeanor shifted instantly, radiating professionalism. Pride swelled in my chest at his impeccable conduct.

"I was wondering if Sebastian and Grayson could join me for a quick word in private," Cyrus said, phrasing it as a question though it clearly wasn’t.

"Of course. I was just updating him on security. I should return to my post. Enjoy your evening, Alpha Cyrus." Nathan gave a slight bow before disappearing into the crowd.

"Where are we headed?" I asked as Cyrus turned to leave. Sebastian and I followed him through the throng of guests.

"Just in here." He led us into a side room. The music muffled as soon as the door closed behind us. Inside, the other Alphas were deep in discussion, tension thick in the air.

"What's going on?" I asked, instantly on edge.

"My daughter remembered more details," Cyrus began. "I questioned her earlier, but this afternoon, she came to me with new information. She might be able to retrace the route to the house where they were held—she remembers looking through the windshield. I assume you haven’t questioned the other rescued girls yet, given your injuries, but this could give us a lead." His gaze bore into me.

"That’s huge. We’d need a team ready to move immediately if she can pinpoint the location," Lorenzo interjected, slamming his fist against the wall.

"Hold on. We have no intel on their security, manpower, or those wolf creatures. We can’t send our people in blind," Damian countered.

"If we’re caught, they’ll move the girls. A team would be necessary as backup," Cyrus added reluctantly, shooting me an apologetic glance.

"Either way, this is your call. You’re in charge, and we trust your judgment," Cyrus said firmly.

"If it helps, we’ve reviewed your notes. Every decision you made was spot-on—exactly what we would’ve done. Now, it’s up to you to decide our next move," Cyrus assured me.

Relief washed over me at his words, and I lifted my chin slightly. "I thi—"

I froze. A wave of pure panic shot through me—Audrey’s emotions spiked before vanishing entirely.

"Something’s wrong."

###Chapter 473
Audrey's POV

The evening couldn't have been more perfect. Laughter and music filled the air as guests danced under the twinkling lights. I alternated between chatting with Evelyn and Sophia and mingling with the allied Lunas. If I wasn’t with them, I was in the restroom—my little ones seemed determined to turn my bladder into a trampoline.

Needing a breath of fresh air, I settled into a chair near the exit. A guard cracked the door open, letting in a cool breeze that soothed my flushed skin. Grayson’s tension had eased earlier, and I prayed it meant good news. But it was getting late—his meeting needed to wrap up soon.

"Luna!" A voice gasped.

I turned to see someone in a Hulk costume rushing toward me, their eyes wild with panic.

"What’s wrong?" I asked, already pushing myself up.

"He rejected her! She—she’s—" The Hulk choked on a sob, gesturing frantically toward the hallway.

My pulse spiked. "Show me!"

Before I could fully stand, they bolted. Gripping the railing, I scanned for a guard—only to find them breaking up a brawl. "Damn it," I muttered.

My swollen feet protested as I hurried into the hall. There, curled on the floor in a trembling heap, was a girl. Her sobs echoed off the walls.

"Here!" The Hulk called.

Every step sent a jolt of pain through my ankles, but I forced myself forward. As I neared, I noticed her black sheet had ridden up, revealing a dark bruise on her shin.

My stomach dropped.

Before I could speak, I tugged the fabric higher—and froze.

Her legs were a canvas of purple and yellow, some bruises fresh, others fading.

"I’m sorry," she whispered, meeting my gaze with watery eyes.

"Sorry for what?"

Her stare flicked behind me.

A cold dread shot through my veins.

Too late.

A sickly-sweet cloth crushed against my nose. The world tilted violently as darkness swallowed me whole.

"Do you see the size of her stomach? Tying her up was your brilliant plan?"

A pounding headache dragged me toward consciousness. My limbs screamed from being bound too long. Something slammed—a door?—and the sound nearly split my skull. Nausea churned, but I clenched my jaw, refusing to vomit.

"Are you awake?" a small voice whispered.

"No," I groaned.

Fingers worked at my restraints. "You can move now."

But I didn’t. Exhaustion won. I curled into myself and let oblivion take me again.

Three infants cooed before me.

My breath caught.

The blankets Grayson had been so secretive about—these were our babies. My knees buckled as I reached for them, tears blurring my vision.

Elijah Grayson. Cooper Alexander. Eliana Audrey.

Names embroidered on tiny blankets.

"My babies," I sobbed, gathering them against my chest.

"My child."

A voice like starlight.

I turned. Light blinded me until a figure emerged—gliding, ethereal. The glow dimmed, revealing her face.

The Moon Goddess.

Terror spiked. "Am I dead? Are they—?"

"No, little wolf. You’re dreaming." She cupped my babies’ heads. "I came to warn you."

"Warn me?"

"Of what’s coming." Her gaze turned grave. "You must awaken your alpha blood. These false wolves defy my balance. You must end them."

"How?"

"Stop running from your power." She began fading. "Find it. Or all is lost."

"Wait!" I screamed as the dream dissolved—

—only to be yanked back by a sneering voice:

"Look who decided to join us."

###Chapter 474

The first thing I noticed was the uneven mattress beneath me. A steady beeping sound reached my ears before my eyelids fluttered open. For a brief moment, I thought I was in a hospital. The monitors strapped around my belly, the IV in my arm, and the sharp scent of disinfectant all pointed to it—until I saw the concrete walls.

"Where am I?" My voice was hoarse.

On the screen beside me, three tiny heartbeats pulsed in near-perfect sync.

"That’s not important right now," a cold voice replied. "Do you recognize me?"

A man in a white coat stood at the foot of my bed, scribbling notes on a clipboard. Another figure loomed to my right, his gaze predatory. His dark eyes locked onto mine, sending a shiver down my spine.

"No," I answered truthfully. I had my suspicions, but I wasn’t about to volunteer information.

"My name is Lorenzo." His lips curled into a smirk. "I’m sure your mate has mentioned me."

He must have seen the flicker of fear in my eyes because he chuckled, circling the bed like a vulture. "What are you doing to my children?"

"Nothing at the moment," the doctor replied without looking up. "They’re developing well, but they need more time. Another week or two before birth."

Lorenzo scowled. "That’s too long. Can she travel?"

"Absolutely not. Air travel could cause a blood clot. If she dies, you lose the bloodline." The doctor shot him a pointed glare before striding out.

I suddenly became aware of how exposed I was. The thin hospital gown barely covered me—another layer of humiliation.

"Now, back to you." Lorenzo lifted a clear bag filled with dark red liquid. "Thanks for the donation. Pity I couldn’t take more—didn’t want to risk the babies. But this? This will make an excellent batch of serum."

Tears welled in my eyes as he laughed and walked out, leaving me alone in my prison.

My legs were swollen, useless. When I tried to move, a sharp pain shot through my back.

"Don’t try to move," the doctor warned as he re-entered, carrying a bucket. "You’ve got an epidural. One wrong shift, and you could paralyze yourself."

He bent down, emptying a catheter bag—my catheter bag. Humiliation burned through me.

"I think I’m going to be sick."

"Here." He tossed me a plastic bag and left again.

After retching, a gentle hand took the bag from me. "I’m Rosalie, your nurse. Don’t worry—no man has touched you inappropriately."

"Thank you," I whispered.

She wiped my forehead with a damp cloth, her arms covered in bruises.

"I’ve been trapped here for years," she admitted softly. "They forced me into medical training."

"Who were you before this?"

She shook her head. "I don’t remember. One day, I found a file on missing girls—my picture was in it. I tried to investigate, but they caught me. Beat me. Nearly killed me." Her voice trembled. "But I survived."

"Why are you helping me?"

"Because I’m your nurse," she said, glancing over her shoulder. "And because I’ve heard about you. When help comes… take me with you. Please."

Her desperate plea tugged at my heart. "I will," I promised.

A loud bang outside made her jump. "I have to go. I’ll bring food later." She hurried out, sealing me back into silence.

I was trapped—no movement in my legs, no way to fight. The epidural ensured I couldn’t even stand. The only mercy? Lorenzo said I had a week or two before the babies came.

That gave Grayson time to find me.

But with no clock, no windows, no way to track time, all I could do was pray.

Pray my babies stayed safe inside me.

Pray Grayson reached me before Lorenzo took me away.

As my hand rested on my swollen belly, the tiny kicks slowed beneath my touch.

"Stay put," I whispered. "Our lives depend on it."
###Chapter 475
Grayson POV

My worst nightmare had come to life right before my eyes. The fact that I hadn’t slaughtered everyone last night was a miracle—one I deserved a damn medal for. Nathan, my Beta, the man responsible for security, sat across from me with a black eye, a shattered nose, and somehow, miraculously, an intact jaw. Only because Sebastian had dragged me off him before I could finish the job.

Every Alpha in the pack was crammed into my office, strategizing our next move. Frankly, I was fresh out of patience. I didn’t care if Cassandra wanted to talk or not. She’d be compelled, one way or another. And if Seraphina didn’t start talking? She wouldn’t live to see another sunset. Answers were due, and if they refused to give them, I’d paint the walls with the blood of anyone who so much as breathed wrong in my direction.

The only sliver of hope I clung to was that they wouldn’t kill Audrey. They needed her blood. Keeping her alive meant more of it. The doctor had assured me we still had time before the babies arrived—unless they decided to carve them out of her prematurely.

I spun my chair, fingers pressed to my temples, watching the men debate how to handle the interrogation. Sebastian strode in, informing me Seraphina was waiting outside, ready when we were.

Nathan stood, motioning to the guard. "Bring her in."

The door swung open, and two warriors dragged Seraphina inside, forcing her into the chair across from me. The room fell silent as her gaze swept over us, but there wasn’t a trace of fear in her eyes. Just defiance.

Leaning forward, I cut straight to the point. "Answers. Now." My voice was deceptively calm, but beneath it, my wolf snarled, barely restrained. My eyes had stayed black since Audrey was taken, my words laced with a growl.

"I don’t know what you want from me. All I know is what happened when Damian was alive." She crossed her arms, unfazed.

A snap of my fingers, and two men seized her, pinning her arms to the chair’s rests. She fought, but it was useless. Her glare burned with fury as she spat, "After everything I’ve survived, you think this scares me?"

"What do you know about Dominic kidnapping humans?"

A flicker of recognition—gone just as fast. "Nothing."

I glanced at Oliver and Donovan. They didn’t hesitate. One finger snapped back with a sickening crack. The sound was satisfying, but Seraphina only gritted her teeth, refusing to scream.

"Tell me what I want to know, and I’ll make it quick. Painless or excruciating—your choice. There are plenty of bones left to break."

"Go to hell."

Another finger broke.

"SHIT!" Her eyes darted to her mangled hand, anger still blazing, but now edged with panic.

"I already know they took humans. I want to know where."

"Fine! A damn castle in the woods! Happy? I don’t know where—they didn’t exactly give me a map!"

"Try harder. We already knew that."

Oliver and Donovan broke another finger on each hand.

"I swear, I don’t know! I was just a warm body in their beds!"

"Too bad for you, I don’t believe that." I leaned back, steepling my fingers. "Even if you think it’s useless, I want every detail."

"I don’t know! They’d leave for days, come back bragging about their 'hunt,' then disappear again a week later. That’s it!"

"Still holding out."

Four more fingers snapped. Sweat beaded on her forehead.

"I swear!" Her defiance wavered, but not enough.

"Did they ever mention how they got the humans?"

"Fuck, I don’t remember!" She rolled her eyes.

Oliver and Donovan crushed her wrist this time. Bones shattered.

Seraphina screamed.

"Try again," I said as her cries faded.

"They put out ads for fake jobs or grabbed junkies from alleys—people no one would miss. Figure it out yourself!" Her breath came in ragged gasps, sweat dripping down her face.

As much as I wanted to beat her to death, I needed intel. Sebastian’s team was scouring every lead, tracking the vans we’d intercepted. I prayed they’d find something.

"Did they cross state lines?"

"I. Don’t. Know!" She leaned forward, spitting each word like a curse.

This time, her forearm snapped. Her fingers jutted at grotesque angles, her hand limp. The bone had splintered so badly her arm bent upward unnaturally.

"We can keep going. Toes next. Then legs. Then ribs." My expression stayed cold, but inside, rage burned white-hot.

###Chapter 476

"The only information I have is that they required a secluded training ground." My fingers drummed impatiently against the armrest. "The transformed humans underwent further conditioning. And they needed to hunt—their appetites are far larger than ours, and they consume only meat. Search for some godforsaken woodland."

Vivienne's head lolled back against the chair, her eyes squeezing shut as she steadied her breathing. I scanned the room, waiting for additional questions, but the others remained silent.

Grayson locked eyes with me before nodding. In one swift motion, he stood before Vivienne, his hands gripping either side of her face. A sharp crack echoed through the room as her neck snapped cleanly. Her body went limp, nearly sliding from the chair.

"Remove her," Grayson ordered. "Nathan, bring Cassandra in."

The warrior by the door moved instantly, hauling Vivienne's lifeless form over his shoulder before disappearing. Moments later, Cassandra entered, her steps quick but unsteady as she took the vacated seat.

"Alpha," she murmured, bowing low, her gaze fixed on the floor. Whether Nathan had instructed her to show such deference didn’t matter—she was bound by my command regardless.

"You will answer Alpha Grayson’s questions completely and truthfully," I stated. No need to ask if she understood. As a member of my pack, refusal wasn’t an option.

"Cassandra," Grayson began, his voice devoid of warmth, "you were mated to Adrian before Nathan, correct?"

She stiffened but kept her spine straight. "Yes, Alpha. That was my fate."

"Did you ever overhear them discussing other locations?" Grayson shifted to the side, forcing her to turn her head to meet his gaze.

"A few times, while cleaning, I caught fragments of conversation." Her fingers twisted in her lap. "Nothing concrete. They mentioned a vacation property in the neighboring state, but I couldn’t pinpoint where."

Torturing her was unnecessary—she was under my control. "Were you ever taken into the woods?"

Her breath hitched. "Once. They dragged me to an ancient-looking house deep in the forest. Made me clean the basement." Her voice dropped to a whisper. "There was blood... everywhere."

Grayson’s gaze flicked to me. I gave a curt nod, and he pressed on. "What happened down there?"

"A massacre." Cassandra shut her eyes briefly, as if to block out the memory. "A few girls were still alive. I ended their suffering before they could be buried alive."

Sebastian spoke up. "That might’ve been their initial testing site before relocating."

Cassandra’s head jerked up. "Testing?" Her eyes darted to me before she quickly averted them again.

Grayson’s tone was ice. "What do you know about experiments?"

Sympathy wouldn’t be tolerated—not even from Nathan, who stood rigid by the door, his wolf straining beneath his skin. Thankfully, he kept it leashed.

"Nothing about experiments," Cassandra admitted. "But once, Dominic stormed into Adrian’s and my room, furious. He said Adrian had failed to secure something, and they’d breached the city." She shrugged helplessly. "I don’t know if that helps."

"Anything else?" Sebastian pressed.

"No. After Dominic saw me, I was beaten and warned to stay silent. Spent a week in the infirmary."

Then it struck me—why hadn’t I considered this sooner? If they sought powerful female blood, they wouldn’t have needed to look far.

"Cassandra," I commanded, "fetch Vivienne Andrews. Now."

She bolted from the room before Grayson could protest. "I wasn’t finished questioning her."

"They wanted blood, didn’t they?" I met each of their stares. "Powerful female blood."

Only Sebastian stepped forward, realization dawning in his eyes. "That’s why they kept her alive."

"Who?" Damian asked.

"Vivienne. Audrey’s mother." I leaned back in my chair, the weight of the revelation settling over me.

"I forgot she was still breathing," Sebastian muttered.

"She’s alive, but her mind isn’t intact," Nathan said flatly. "Reports say she speaks nonsense, regressing to her childhood before Audrey was born."

"Audrey told me the same." Saying her name was like swallowing glass. Worse, hearing it from Nathan’s mouth. Every Alpha had guards stationed—how they’d taken Audrey still made no sense. Investigations were underway, but answers eluded us.

"Alpha Grayson!" Vivienne Andrews floated into the room, beaming. After greeting everyone with exaggerated handshakes, she perched on the chair, crossing her legs. "How may I serve you?"

"Vivienne, you’re aware your daughter was taken?" I couldn’t bring myself to say Audrey’s name again.

"Of course! But I have faith you’ll retrieve her. It’s your destiny, after all."

"My destiny?" My brows furrowed.

"All those years in that cell, I told myself Audrey would find a powerful protector." She grinned, pointing at me. "And she did!"

"Did they ever take your blood while you were imprisoned?"

Vivienne threw her head back and laughed.

###Chapter 477

"They thought they could strip me of everything, but they failed! My pride remains untouched!"

"Vivienne, your BLOOD!" My voice thundered with barely restrained fury, forcing her to lower her head.

Her neck tensed as she resisted submission, but ultimately, she yielded. "Yes, they took my blood for a while, but they stopped eventually."

"When did they stop?" Alpha Grayson demanded.

"Alpha Grayson, time meant nothing in that place. Chained to a wall, starving and exposed—how could I track days? At first, I tried counting, then seasons. How many winters did I endure, wondering if the cold would finally claim me? Eventually, even seasons blurred. You just wait for the day death finally takes you." Vivienne stared at me as if I were a fool.

Despite my command, she couldn’t answer properly. "Did you ever hear anything about experiments?" I tightened my grip on her will.

"No. When boredom consumed me, I drew in the dirt." A faint smile touched her lips at the memory. "Did you know I used to love drawing as a child? Colored pencils, even oils sometimes." Her gaze drifted around the room, lingering on the men.

Their expressions mirrored each other—pity mixed with irritation. Maybe I could still extract something useful from her, but I’d have to leash my rage and ask the right questions.

Audrey’s POV

"If I’d known drawing blood would be this effortless, I would’ve insisted all the women get epidurals." Lorenzo stood at the foot of my bed, watching as the doctor filled yet another bag with my blood.

"Your disregard for women’s lives is appalling." My arms crossed over my chest, helpless as they manipulated my legs. Apparently, my veins were perfect for their needs.

"Once this batch of elixir is complete, we’ll have enough human stock to launch an attack on your stolen pack lands." His smirk was venomous, eyes glinting with malice.

My stomach dropped. Kidnapped, yes—but I’d assumed security would be impenetrable. "Speaking of which… how did you take me?"

"Tch." Lorenzo rolled his eyes as the doctor adjusted the nearly full bag.

"Was it not your plan? Is that why you won’t say?" Maybe taunting him would loosen his tongue.

Instead of answering, he crossed the room in three strides and struck me so fast I didn’t see it coming. My head snapped sideways with a sickening crack.

Stunned. That was the only word. I’d never been hit before. Tears welled instantly, blood trickling down my chin. Humiliation and fury warred inside me as I forced myself to meet his gaze.

"Mind your tongue, woman. The only reason you’re still breathing is those pups. Once they’re out, they won’t protect you. You’ll never see them after I carve them from you."

"Lorenzo. You have much to learn about respect." A new voice cut through the room. The doctor peeled the needle from my leg, securing it with tape.

"Uncle, I—"

"Silence. She is heavily pregnant, defenseless. Does striking her make you feel powerful?"

Two things registered. First, this was Lorenzo’s uncle—no ally of mine. Second, this must be the man Grayson had met. The one with morals, despite being a criminal.

"Why are you here?" Lorenzo’s tone dripped with insolence.

A whisper of fabric brushed my hand. Through tear-blurred lashes, I saw a white handkerchief dangling before me.

"Thank you." My fingers trembled as I took it, dabbing my split lip.

"Do you know who I am?" His voice was softer now.

Gathering courage, I lifted my gaze. "No." The man before me was striking, but his eyes mirrored Lorenzo’s—dark, fathomless.

"I am Don Vittorio Romano. Head of the Italian Syndicate. Lorenzo’s uncle. And I met with your mate regarding you."

"Yes. He declared war because you demanded my blood by force." My voice shook despite my effort to sound strong.

Amusement flickered in his gaze. "Correct. I offered compromise. He refused."

I hadn’t known that—but Grayson would never agree to anything less than my absolute safety.

"Grayson will come for me."

"Yes. He will." Don Vittorio nodded.

"He has to find us first." Lorenzo sneered.

The don sighed, visibly resisting an eye roll. "You underestimate our enemy."

"Why don’t you?" Lorenzo shot back.

"Forgive me, but where is your Alpha?" The words slipped out before I could stop them.

I flinched, half-expecting another blow, but held my ground.

Don Vittorio threw his head back laughing while Lorenzo turned crimson, fists clenched like a petulant child. The sight was almost comical.
###Chapter 478

"Lorenzo. Go cool off." Don Vittorio said, still chuckling.

Lorenzo glared at me for a long moment, his jaw clenched as if he wanted to say something. But in the end, he snapped his mouth shut and stormed out of the room—unfortunately taking the blood bag with him.

"I apologize for my nephew's lack of manners," Don Vittorio sighed. "He still has much to learn in this world."

"He might not get the chance," I muttered, relieved that Lorenzo was finally gone.

"Grayson is determined to see him dead," Don Vittorio agreed.

"He kidnapped me. If there wasn’t already a target on his back, there is now."

"Again, we did offer for you to voluntarily give us your blood."

"Why would you even want to be involved in this? You do realize that when Grayson comes, everyone here will be in his crosshairs. That includes you and your men."

"Ah, but you see, I liked Grayson. His attitude, the respect he showed by requesting a meeting rather than declaring war outright. Lorenzo is my blood, so his problems are mine—but he’s making too many mistakes. By coming here to rescue you, I might earn some... favor."

"From what I know, just because he’s family doesn’t mean you have to take on his self-made disasters. You could’ve walked away. Instead, you chose to help him—which means you were probably involved in my kidnapping from the start."

"I won’t deny his mess intrigues me. It could bring me power in Italy, so yes, I’m interested. But that doesn’t include harming innocent pure-blooded Alpha females." He leaned forward. "Here’s my offer: I’ll keep Lorenzo away from you if you cooperate. Let the doctor do what’s necessary, and I’ll ensure you have a comfortable bed, decent food, and your babies stay with you. No harm will come to you."

"What’s the catch?" There was always one.

His lips curled into a smirk. "Smart girl. The catch is, I can take it all away in an instant. Refuse the doctor, and your babies will be taken. You’ll be thrown into a concrete cell with rat food—just enough to keep you alive so we can take your blood by force. These babies can be removed at any time. You can carry them to term, or I can have them extracted today. Either way, they’ll be on a plane to Italy within hours, and you’ll never see them again."

"Do you expect me to beg Grayson to spare your life in exchange for a comfortable prison?"

"No. I assure you, my safety isn’t in question. This is about my personal code—I refuse to cross certain lines. Do we have a deal?"

"My babies stay with me? I carry them to term, and no harm comes to them?"

"Correct."

"And no one touches me? Lorenzo stays away?"

"The doctor and nurse will tend to you," he clarified. "But the epidural won’t stay. It’s coming out tonight."

"No one takes blood from my babies," I said firmly.

"Unless you prove useless, they’ll be protected. Besides, your blood is stronger than theirs—until you die." He turned to leave.

"Fine. I’ll take your deal. But once I’m rescued, it’s void."

Don Vittorio paused, glancing back with a glint in his eyes that made me second-guess my decision. "Obviously."

The moment the door shut, a tear slipped down my cheek. All I wanted was my babies safe. As soon as my hand rested on my belly, they kicked in response.

"Mommy loves you," I whispered. "I’ll do anything to protect you."

I didn’t know what Grayson was doing right now, but I prayed he was coming. Surely, Magnus or Victoria would have found something by now.

A bitter laugh escaped me. Magnus. The man whose death we’d faked. How the tables had turned. But saving me would guarantee his safety from Lorenzo. I was certain Grayson would protect anyone who helped me—if not for my sake, then for our children.

"I hear you’re settling in!" The doctor entered, his yellowed teeth completing his unsettling aura. There was nothing comforting about him—just pure creepiness.

Thankfully, the kind nurse followed. Her name escaped me at the moment.

"Apparently," I muttered.

"I’ll remove your catheter," the nurse said.

"While she does that, I’ll start unhooking you," the doctor added. "Once we move you to the bedroom, you’ll be reconnected. It’s been converted into a partial delivery room—everything I need is there."

"Is there an actual bed?" If I was stuck in this medical prison, I at least wanted comfort.

"Queen-sized," the nurse assured me. "With a pregnancy pillow. The bathroom is fully stocked too." She offered a small, reassuring smile.
###Chapter 479
Grayson POV

"Is Magnus awake yet?" Alpha Cyrus asked, his voice sharp with impatience.

"No," Vivienne answered, stepping aside as she left the room. Nathan had taken over the task of extracting every possible detail from her. How he planned to do it wasn’t my concern.

"Is he in a medically induced coma?"

"What are you implying?" Alpha Sebastian cut in, his tone wary.

"Wake him the hell up. I don’t care what it does to him. He’s lucky to be breathing, and he’s got his mate. Get him conscious and get the answers we need."

The idea hadn’t crossed my mind until now, but the moment he said it, I was all in. "Grayson, you can’t—" Wesley started, but I was already on my feet.

"Let’s go."

No one dared argue. I strode past them all, heading straight for the hospital. Whether they liked it or not, they followed. Even if it killed him, I wouldn’t hesitate.

"Alpha Grayson?" A nurse gasped as I stormed through the entrance. The door slammed against the wall with enough force to crack the frame, but somehow, it held.

Ignoring her, I took the stairs two at a time to the second floor. "Alpha Grayson," the guard greeted, though his eyes flickered nervously behind me. His brows furrowed, but he stayed silent.

"Get the doctor handling his case. Now."

"No need. He’s already inside."

The door groaned as I shoved it open before the handle had fully turned. "Doctor. Wake him up."

The doctor startled, nearly dropping his clipboard. Victoria, hovering near the bed, flinched back under the weight of my aura. "Alpha Grayson? You want me to—what?"

"I need answers. Wake him. Now."

"Alpha, if I do that, his brain could swell again. He might—"

"I don’t give a damn if he dies. My Luna is missing, and he might know where she is. Do it."

The doctor hesitated, then relented. "B-but Grayson…" Victoria whispered, her voice trembling. A low, dangerous growl rumbled in my chest as I turned my glare on her. "Alpha Grayson… please."

"You’re both involved. Don’t forget your own guilt." My voice was lethally calm, and she visibly shook, stepping back toward Magnus’s side.

"Fine," the doctor muttered. "But if his pressure spikes, I’ll have to sedate him again. You’ll have minutes at most."

"Do it."

The other Alphas spread out around the room, forming a silent barrier. Arms crossed, I watched as the doctor injected a milky substance into Magnus’s IV.

"Give it a moment." He grabbed another syringe, ready.

"Magnus?" Victoria clutched his hand, tears spilling. The sight made my fingers twitch with the urge to hurl her across the room.

"Victoria?" His voice was weak, disoriented.

"You’re alive." She sobbed, pressing her forehead to his knuckles.

"Move."

She flinched but obeyed, retreating to the far side of the bed.

"Grayson?" Magnus struggled to open his eyes, blinking sluggishly.

"Lorenzo took Audrey. Where would he take her?" The desperation in my own voice surprised me.

"What?" His hand rose to his temple, fingers pressing into his skin.

"Lorenzo. Has Audrey. Where?" I repeated, sharper.

"His… family… brother… no." The monitors beeped faster. "Family house."

"A family property? Where?"

"Road… follow… it’s—AAARGH!" He arched, screaming.

"That’s enough!" The doctor shoved Victoria aside and jammed the sedative into the IV.

"Hurry!" Magnus gasped before his body went slack.

"Damn it!" My roar shook the walls.

"Victoria," Sebastian stepped forward. "What happened after the castle?"

She was crying into Magnus’s chest. At the question, she lifted her head, tear tracks glistening. "What?"

"After you fled when Grayson attacked the castle," he clarified.

"We never left." Her gaze darted between us.

"What?" My blood turned to ice.

"I saw you chase Lorenzo myself," Wesley interjected.

"No. You saw decoys. Earlier that day, they found the trackers under our tongues. They cut them out and planted them in strangers. The plan was to have them hide in the woods. But I… I messed up."

"What happened?" I demanded, though part of me already knew.

"At dinner, Lorenzo kept interrogating me. How Magnus and I met, where we wanted to live… I cracked. He twisted my arm until I talked. They tied me down, searched me, found the tracker. That’s why I didn’t wake when you stormed in—I was unconscious. Magnus had just returned. Lorenzo pinned him, found his tracker as your forces attacked. They shoved them into a random girl and a warrior, sent them running. I woke up later. We were tied to chairs. Magnus took the beatings… while I broke."



###Chapter 480

"Where did this happen?" I demanded.

Victoria wiped her tear-streaked face. "I don't know. They blindfolded us. Magnus was bleeding out, and I—I panicked. The next thing I knew, they threw me into a cell to be auctioned off. They laughed, thinking Magnus would die and I'd follow soon after. To them, I was just another worthless payment."

"Payment?" My grip tightened on the armrest.

"To participate in the auction, you have to supply women. The more you provide, the more influence you have. Lorenzo used to control everything because he brought in the most. Magnus said he kept doing it to manipulate the other Alphas."

Nathaniel leaned forward. "If Lorenzo is delivering damaged or dying girls, he's going to piss off a lot of people."

"Not if those wolves back him up," Cyrus countered. "He won’t care who he screws over—he’ll be untouchable."

Sebastian crossed his arms. "That’s probably why his uncle is here. Trying to expand their operation."

"What if he’s setting up a new branch of the mafia here?" Nathaniel suggested.

Victoria sniffled. "The mafia boss—Don Vittorio—never hurt me. He said he liked gambling because drunk men were easy targets." She straightened, wiping her nose. "He offered me a deal."

My pulse spiked. "You spoke to him?"

"He promised medical care for Magnus if I told him what I knew. So I did. But it wasn’t much—Magnus was supposed to relay information to you, not me. After that, I never saw him again until now. The other girls warned me about his deals. Unless it's in writing, there's always a catch."

"Damn," Oliver muttered.

"You said Audrey was taken?" Victoria's voice dropped. "The girls told me it's better to refuse his offers, no matter how tempting. It’s never in your favor."

A cold dread settled in my chest. Audrey would do anything to protect our children—even if it meant walking into a trap.

"Let’s move to your office," Nathaniel said abruptly.

I stood. "If you remember anything else, tell me immediately."

We walked back, tension thickening the air. The casino theory made sense—endless victims, endless experiments.

The moment I sat, Cyrus shut the door. "You think he’s operating from the casino?"

"Possible," I said. "Magnus kept saying 'family.' Maybe he meant the Romanos."

Sebastian paced. "What if it’s a family estate? Somewhere they own but don’t use publicly."

"We need to look into that," Cyrus agreed. "But what’s the immediate threat?"

Nathaniel frowned. "You think an attack’s coming?"

"He hasn’t retaliated yet," Sebastian said darkly. "That means it’s coming—and it’ll be brutal."

"We need to prepare," Oliver growled, slamming his fist on the chair. "Call in every available fighter. This isn’t just about Audrey and Grayson anymore. Lorenzo declared war."

I exhaled sharply. Normally, Audrey’s presence grounded me. Without her, rage simmered beneath my skin, ready to explode.

"Grayson," Sebastian said carefully, "set up another Alpha meeting. We need a plan."

My wolf bristled at being told what to do, but he wasn’t wrong. "Fine."

As they filed out, I mind-linked Nathan. "Get here. Now."

"Almost there," he replied, breathless.

Ten minutes and two snapped pencils later, he burst in. "I got something from Vivienne."

"Spit it out," I snapped.

He hesitated. "She’s not… coherent. Cassandra said her mind’s fractured. You can’t just command answers."

"I don’t care. What did she say?"

The room went still as Nathan swallowed.

"She mentioned a road. A hidden one."

My blood turned to ice.

Magnus’s last words echoed in my skull.

Follow the road.
###Chapter 481

"I'm not certain if this means anything significant, but she mentioned meeting Don Vittorio Romano multiple times." Nathan leaned forward, his voice dropping to a whisper. "She claimed they were old friends. Apparently, she enjoyed his visits because it meant she could leave her cell, clean up, and wear proper clothes. But afterward, she’d get beaten for talking too much and causing trouble."

"Seriously?" I frowned, my fingers tightening around the edge of the desk.

"Absolutely." Nathan nodded. "Though, I’m not sure how much of it is coherent. She kept rambling about enormous rose bushes and unbearable heat. She mentioned traveling, sitting by windows—probably meaning she wasn’t locked in a trunk. But she always ended up back in a cell."

"Did she ever attempt to escape?"

Nathan hesitated. "When I asked, she just muttered something about thorn halos that smelled sweet."

"I have no idea what that means," I admitted, rubbing my temples.

"Neither do I." Nathan’s lips twitched. "But she did say the place was incredibly noisy."

"A casino is noisy," I mused, my mind racing.

"Bingo." Nathan smirked. "I’m not saying they’re conducting experiments inside the casino, but it could be a front or a meeting spot—just like how we met with Romano. If Lorenzo took her there for dinner with him..." He trailed off, letting the implication hang in the air.

"That’s an interesting lead." My pulse quickened. "They wouldn’t be too far from it. Transporting that many people wouldn’t be easy." I grabbed my phone and dialed Sebastian’s men, who were already scouting the area.

"Who are you calling?" Nathan asked, his brow furrowed.

"Surveillance at the casino," I said as the line connected. "I need someone undercover inside. Just gather intel on the layout—no unnecessary risks. I suspect they might be targeting intoxicated patrons for their experiments. There could be a nearby estate or abandoned building they’re using."

"Maybe an old warehouse?" the voice on the other end suggested.

"Exactly. Do you have anything concrete yet?" Hope flared in my chest.

"Not yet. We’re pulling property records for the area. Give me some time to dig deeper." The call ended abruptly.

"What now?" Nathan looked at me expectantly, but I had no answers.

I shrugged, my throat tight. Going home wasn’t an option. The emptiness would only amplify the memories of Audrey and the life we’d been building. If I stepped inside now, I’d probably destroy everything in sight.

Nathan stood and headed for the door, pausing before he left. He turned back, pity flickering in his eyes. "I’ll handle the dinner arrangements. Just be ready in two hours."

When I didn’t respond, he left, closing the door softly behind him. I was adrift—useless, sitting here drowning in self-pity while others did the real work. We needed actionable intel, and right now, I had nothing.

I lost track of time until a quiet knock interrupted the silence. I ignored it, but five minutes later, the door creaked open.

"Mind if I come in?" Alpha Blackwood peered inside.

"Does it matter?" I muttered. He was already halfway in before I’d finished speaking.

He smirked. "Not really, but I was trying to be polite."

"I thought we were meeting for supper." I wasn’t in the mood for a heart-to-heart. Spinning my chair absently, I rested my head in my hand and watched him settle into the armchair across from me.

"You’re handling this well," he began.

"Fantastic," I deadpanned.

"I mean it." His expression turned serious. "If I were in your position, half this office would be in ruins by now."

"Great. Listen—I don’t need a pat on the back for doing the bare minimum while my pregnant mate is missing."

"That’s not why I’m here." He leaned forward. "I just wanted you to know you’re not alone in this. Your father may be gone, but he taught you well. And politics aside, I’m here if you need me. Off the record."

The words left me torn between discomfort and gratitude. "Why are you really here?" I asked, straightening in my chair.

"My daughter is ready to retrace her steps. We leave at dawn tomorrow to scout the area."

"That’s… actually helpful." Surprise flickered through me.

"I do have one question, though." He shifted, hesitating. "Audrey took the Alpha title. If Lorenzo was part of that pack, couldn’t she just command them to release her?"

"Honestly, she never wanted the title. I doubt it even crossed her mind. Most of them abandoned the pack after Lorenzo left. He’s probably not even considered part of it anymore. And Don Vittorio? He’s not pack—Audrey has no control over him. Even if she could command Lorenzo’s men, Vittorio wouldn’t let her walk away."

"She never wanted to be an Alpha?" Blackwood clarified.

"No. I’m shocked she still holds the title." Audrey was too kind, too gentle for that world.

"Alright." He stood, slapping his thighs. "Let’s head to dinner. I’ll brief the others about tomorrow. Then we’ll plan our next move."

"Yeah." I exhaled, my chest aching. Audrey had the softest heart—one that rarely held space for anger.



###Chapter 482
Audrey POV

"This will be your new temporary residence." The nurse gestured toward an ornate door on the right. The corridor resembled a luxury boutique hotel, with plush emerald carpets and gilded frames housing abstract paintings between antique mirrors.

Stepping inside took my breath away. The suite opened into a sunlit living area where two velvet chaise lounges faced each other across a crystal coffee table. Flames danced behind glass in a modern electric fireplace, casting warm reflections on the marble walls.

To the left, a gourmet kitchen gleamed with stainless steel appliances beside a fully stocked wine fridge. The monochromatic decor screamed sophistication - dove gray cabinets against Carrara marble countertops. A powder room hid discreetly near the entrance while double doors revealed two lavish bedrooms connected by a shared spa bathroom. The rainfall shower and heated towel racks were nice, but it was the sterile white linens and generic landscape prints that confirmed this was a gilded cage.

"Dinner will arrive shortly," the nurse said, adjusting her scrubs. "You should rest on the sofa. Elevating your feet would help with circulation."

"Of course." I forced a smile, guilt prickling at enjoying such comforts under these circumstances.

As I settled onto the cushions, she arranged orthopedic pillows beneath my legs and neck with clinical precision. After handing me a remote, she attached wireless monitors to track my vitals.

Her sudden proximity made my skin prickle. When she leaned in to remove the blood pressure cuff, her whisper ghosted across my ear: "They're watching everything." I barely suppressed my gasp, offering a tight-lipped smile instead as I mindlessly flipped channels.

After placing a carafe of ice water and berry platter within reach, she stood abruptly. "Dr. Chen will draw more labs tomorrow morning."

"Tomorrow?" My fingers tightened around the remote.

"You need proper nutrition first." Her plastic smile didn't reach her eyes as she exited, the soft snick of the locking mechanism echoing like a prison door.

"Did I doom us?" I murmured to my unborn twins, cradling my swollen abdomen.

The television screen abruptly glitched to black before flashing to a surveillance feed. Frantically pressing buttons did nothing - the remote might as well have been a prop.

"Rise and shine." A distorted voice crackled through the speakers. "Wakey wakey, Magnus."

My blood turned to ice. The camera panned across a concrete cell where two figures sat bound back-to-back. When the lens focused, Magnus's battered face filled the screen. My pulse roared in my ears.

"DON'T YOU DARE HURT HIM!" Victoria's scream distorted the audio.

This had to be a sick joke. Magnus and Victoria were supposed to be safe at Nightshade Pack's medical center...weren't they?

CRACK! A gloved hand struck Victoria with such force her head snapped sideways, blood arcing through the air. Her chair rocked violently as she struggled against her restraints.

"Me. Not her." Magnus lifted his head with visible effort, his gaze locking onto Victoria with heartbreaking tenderness even as fresh blood trickled from his split lip.

The camera zoomed out to reveal Lorenzo circling them like a shark. "The great Magnus brought low by sentiment." His oily voice made my stomach churn.

"Go to hell, Lorenzo." Magnus's defiance earned him three brutal punches to the ribs. The wet crunch of cartilage sent bile burning up my throat.

Victoria sobbed hysterically. "I'll tell you whatever you want!"

"Then answer truthfully." Lorenzo grabbed her chin. "Every lie costs Magnus another bone. Understood?"

"I swear!"

"Did you betray me?"

"I was never loyal to you to begin with!" The moment the words left Victoria's lips, Lorenzo's fist plowed into Magnus's solar plexus.

"LIAR!" Lorenzo's roar shook the speakers as Magnus doubled over, retching blood. Victoria's screams dissolved into wordless shrieks as the feed abruptly cut to static.

The remote slipped from my numb fingers. Somewhere beneath the terror, a cold realization crystallized - this wasn't just surveillance.

It was a message.
###Chapter 483

"So, you didn't strike a deal with Xavier? He wasn't going to alter the documents you stole from Grayson's office, meaning I was fed false intel?" Lorenzo challenged, his voice dripping with venom.

"I did, but that doesn't mean I betrayed you! All I wanted was to get Magnus out. I did sneak into Grayson's office—I just didn’t know he was aware of it and planted fake files!" Victoria's voice cracked under the weight of her desperation.

"That mistake cost us everything! We were this close, and because of you, we had to retreat!" Lorenzo roared before delivering a brutal series of punches to Magnus's face and ribs.

"I DIDN’T KNOW!" Victoria shrieked, watching helplessly as her mate crumpled under the assault. When Lorenzo finally stepped back, Magnus spat blood onto the floor, his body limp, though his head still lolled weakly from side to side.

"You led Grayson straight to Ravenstone Keep," Lorenzo declared, his tone final.

"Unknowingly," Victoria shot back, defiance burning in her eyes despite the terror.

"What are Grayson’s plans?" Lorenzo demanded.

"How the hell should I know? I wasn’t exactly invited to his private briefings!" she snapped.

Lorenzo sighed, shaking his head. "I really hoped we could avoid this." He stepped out of view, returning moments later with a baseball bat.

My stomach twisted violently. I barely had time to turn away before I vomited onto the carpet. The sickening crack of metal against bone sent spasms through my body, each impact making me retch again. I squeezed my eyes shut, but I couldn’t block out the sounds—or the horror.

Grayson’s POV

"Good. You’re finally here." Cyrus glared at Anthony as the last Alpha strode into the war room.

"Apologies. I had final preparations to oversee," Anthony shot back, matching Cyrus’s icy stare.

"Tomorrow, Grayson, Cyrus, and I will leave with my daughter to retrace her steps. Sebastian will remain here in command during Grayson’s absence. With any luck, we’ll uncover something useful." Cyrus wasted no time, his voice firm as he laid out the plan.

As he finished speaking, servants entered with trays of food—steak, mashed potatoes, green beans—but the scent turned my stomach. I pushed my plate away, appetite nonexistent.

"How many men are you taking?" Oliver asked.

"A dozen. We’ll conduct reconnaissance. Between Sebastian’s existing patrols and our team, we should be covered. But be ready to mobilize if we find anything." Cyrus took a measured bite, his gaze sharp.

"I’ve submitted a revised patrol schedule to Nathan," Donovan interjected, sliding a sheet toward me. "This rotation incorporates all our forces, positioning a guard every five feet along the border between our pack and Sebastian’s. The entire territory is on high alert. With this setup, each warrior only pulls three shifts a week at twelve hours apiece."

Ethan distributed maps and equipment lists. "Wolf-friendly hospitals are marked, along with mission essentials."

Cyrus nodded approvingly. "Solid work."

Sebastian leaned forward. "Nathan reported the underground panic room for the Lunas is nearly complete. It’ll be ready in a day or two—they’ve prioritized it. Ensure your Lunas know its location and are prepared to move at a moment’s notice."

Oliver turned to me. "What’s the security setup? Can my tech team inspect it? We need cameras covering at least a five-mile radius for proper response time."

"The systems are state-of-the-art. You’ll have full access. The range isn’t quite five miles, but close." I hadn’t personally considered the distance—until now.

Ethan cleared his throat, his expression grave. "One more thing. I know this won’t be popular, but we’re heading into war. We need to address the possibility—is there a mole among us?"

Silence fell, heavy and thick.



###Chapter 484

Sebastian and I exchanged a long glance. The idea of a mole had never crossed our minds. There hadn't been any attacks or leaks that would suggest betrayal. Still, we had put Magnus, Victoria, and Xavier in the field, each with fragments of information, so we weren’t completely in the dark. The one thing that still gnawed at me was how they had discovered my informant.

"I don’t think so," Sebastian murmured, his eyes locked on mine.

"The only thing I can’t figure out is how they knew who my informant was," I admitted. "Hell, I didn’t even know his identity. My father programmed his number into my phone before he died."

"That’s worth investigating," Cyrus agreed with a nod.

"Have you considered tracking down his informant?" Dominic asked.

"I have, but I haven’t had the chance to dig deeper." I set my fork down, pushing my half-eaten plate away.

"Regardless, everything stays in this room," Cyrus said, his gaze sweeping over everyone. "Not even the betas need to know what’s happening. Their only job is to protect the pack while we’re gone."

The command ruffled a few feathers, but no one argued—it was the right call.

"In Evelyn’s absence, Sophia will handle all duties for both packs," Sebastian announced. He hadn’t consulted me, but I trusted her implicitly.

"Grayson, is that what you want?" Dominic asked, a smirk playing on his lips.

Our eyes met. Amusement flickered in his expression, as if he found the whole situation entertaining.

"Dominic, you have exactly two seconds to leave this room before I lose control."

It wasn’t me speaking—it was my wolf. Ancient and volatile, he didn’t tolerate disrespect. Thankfully, Cyrus grabbed Dominic by the collar and hauled him out, with Oliver following and shutting the door behind them.

"What’s his problem?" Nathan asked, leaning back in his chair.

Lorenzo stretched his arms above his head. "It’s not like you actually care that your twin sister is taking over Luna duties."

"I think he just enjoys pushing buttons," Nathan muttered, frowning at Lorenzo.

Lorenzo stood. "Come on. Let’s grab a drink and cool off."

I was the last to rise, but they all waited, watching me until I joined them. Their message was clear—no one was leaving me alone. Who knew what I’d do if left to my own devices? The streets might run red.

"Here, drink this." Lorenzo handed me the first glass from the bar before we stepped onto the porch.

I didn’t hesitate. I downed it before they could pour another. Lorenzo nodded, refilled my glass, and passed out more drinks. Eventually, we made our way outside for fresh air.

We had just settled on the steps when the doors swung open. Cyrus and Oliver walked out—without Dominic.

"Lost some weight?" Damian quipped.

"I don’t know what the hell’s gotten into him," Cyrus muttered, stepping onto the driveway.

Oliver sat just below me. Lorenzo was to my left, Sebastian to my right. Nathan lingered slightly behind, but it was Cyrus who made me feel grounded. These were my people. We didn’t gather often, and when we did, it was never for good reasons—but with them, I always felt a sense of belonging.

I was shattered in the worst way. My pack surrounded me without making it obvious or overly emotional. They’d stand by me the moment we had a plan—but right now, we didn’t. So, I sat there, trying not to imagine what Audrey was enduring.

"What time do we leave tomorrow?" Oliver asked Cyrus.

Cyrus took a long sip before answering. "Before dawn. That way, we’ll have daylight when we arrive. We don’t even know where we’re going—this should be interesting."

"We might need to pay the old man a visit," I said, staring into the amber liquid swirling in my glass. "See what really happened that night."

"He hasn’t reached out since then, has he?" Sebastian asked.

"No."

"You know… I’ve got a few extra bugs lying around," Lorenzo said, a little too eagerly.

"Shouldn’t be hard to plant," Nathan added, sounding amused.

"Grayson can talk to him," Lorenzo continued. "Get him out of the house so we can plant one—or at least scout the area."

"Or inside the actual auction site," Sebastian suggested.

"What we need is a break," Nathan said, his voice turning deadly. "Something that tips the scales in our favor. Kidnapping Audrey was a massive blow—it’s left Grayson barely functional. Not to mention her blood. We need to return the favor. They evened the score after we stopped their convoy."

"Hopefully, we’ll find that tomorrow," Cyrus said, matching Nathan’s intensity. "If my daughter can locate where they’re keeping the girls, we’ll tear them apart."

"That’s assuming she can pull it off," Lorenzo said, giving Cyrus a skeptical look. "Is her wolf back?"

"She lost her wolf?" Nathan asked, shocked.



###Chapter 485
Audrey's POV

Morning light filtered through the curtains, but waking up felt like dragging myself through molasses. After last night's broadcast, I'd yanked the TV cord from the wall and collapsed into bed, my pillow damp with tears. Now, a throbbing headache pulsed behind my eyes, and my eyelids burned like sandpaper. Even my triplets were eerily still—no usual kicks or squabbles.

Maybe they sensed my exhaustion. Or maybe something was wrong.

A sharp cramp seized me, stealing my breath. It coiled low in my belly, then faded just as quickly.

"Audrey? Good morning!" The nurse's cheerful voice sliced through the silence as the door creaked open.

I gritted my teeth as another wave hit, longer this time. My fingers twisted in the sheets.

"Audrey? You awake?" Her tone was honey-sweet.

Thankfully, the blanket hid my grimace. "Yeah," I managed. "Just... need a minute."

She hesitated but didn't press. The clatter of pans echoed from the kitchenette as she left.

Tears pricked my eyes again as I forced myself upright. Every movement sent fresh fire through my abdomen. Something primal whispered: Don't tell her.

I shuffled to the bathroom, clutching the wall. Three steps. Five. Then I doubled over, gasping. It felt like my insides were being wrung out. If I squatted, would the babies just—

The toilet seat was cold beneath me. Relief came, but no babies. Then I saw it: a slick, greenish-yellow smear on the paper. Pink-tinged.

Mucus plug.

Braxton Hicks? Or real labor? Memories from pregnancy books flashed—pressure meant the babies had dropped. The plug meant my cervix was preparing. But the cramps...

Fear iced my veins. Grayson still didn't know where I was. Would I deliver alone? Would they take them? Human triplets needed NICUs—but mine? No one knew what to expect.

"Audrey? Everything okay?" The nurse's voice was closer now.

"Fine!" I chirped, flushing the evidence. "Just slow today."

A closet of clothes taunted me. I grabbed a loose dress, the fabric whispering over my skin. Bacon and eggs wafted in, but the scent turned my stomach.

"Smells amazing," I lied, forcing a smile as another cramp hit. Irregular. Ominous.

"You'll need strength. The doctor's coming today—bloodwork and an ultrasound. He wants to check how close you are."

My heart stuttered. No choice. Refuse, and they'd cut them out. At least they'd be alive.

"Okay," I whispered.

She patted my shoulder, her eyes oddly soft. "Just cooperate. No need for extra pain."

I didn't trust her. Yesterday, she'd admitted wanting out. Yet now, as she piled eggs onto my plate, I wondered: Was her concern real? Or just surveillance?

"Here you go!"

"Thanks." I stabbed a bite, avoiding her gaze while memorizing the kitchen—why so many knives?

"After the doctor, maybe a puzzle?" She sounded hopeful.

"Maybe. I might nap after the blood draw."

"Good idea. Oh!" She brightened, grabbing orange juice. "Hydrate!"

My fingers curled around the glass—

The bedroom door burst open.



###Chapter 486
Grayson POV

The door to my office swung open without warning. "When was the last time you slept?" Cyrus strode in with an energy that grated on my nerves. Each day without Audrey felt like a fresh wound, and my mood reflected it.

"What does it look like?" I shot back. In truth, I hadn't slept a full night since her abduction. How long had it been now? Long enough for doubt to creep into my decisions.

Cyrus pulled a small orange bottle from his pocket and set it on my desk with deliberate care. "You're useless to everyone if you don't rest. Your judgment is slipping. One wrong move could cost lives—yours, your men's, or worst of all... Audrey's." He sank into the chair across from me, watching, waiting for my reaction.

"Where’d you get those?" I asked, torn between irritation and reluctant amusement.

"From the pack physician. I knew you wouldn’t listen to him. You might’ve listened to Sebastian, but I’ve known you since you were a pup. I promised your father I’d look after you before he passed." His voice softened. "You’ve done him proud, Grayson. But you need to be sharp if you want to bring Audrey home."

I wasn’t shocked my father had confided in him. Cyrus had always been like family—birthday gifts, school events, even teaching me to fight. If Dad had chosen someone to get through to me, he’d picked right.

"You think I’m slipping?" I challenged.

"Not yet. But you will be if you don’t rest." His gaze didn’t waver. This wasn’t a suggestion—it was an order.

I snatched the bottle and shoved it into my pocket. "Is your daughter ready?" I was done with the heart-to-heart.

"She is. Wanted to talk to you alone first." Cyrus exhaled, leaning back. "She’s with Theodore at the entrance. Physically, she’s recovering, but her wolf hasn’t returned. I don’t know how much help she’ll be."

"If you trained her half as well as you trained me, she’ll get us closer."

"Assuming she keeps her head straight. The trauma runs deep." For a moment, he looked decades older.

"She doesn’t have a mate, right?" I racked my brain but came up blank. I barely recognized her when we pulled her from that van—it had been too long.

"Not yet. Without her wolf, she may never know."

"Why wouldn’t it come back?" Surely, with time, her wolf would return.

"She says it’s been gone for years." Cyrus sighed just as the fax machine whirred to life.

I checked the clock—3:17 AM. "What the hell?"

Snatching the paper, it took me a second to process. Page after page of missing children, some cases over twenty-five years old. Photos of their young faces, followed by aged projections.

"Have the team analyze these while we’re gone." I dropped the stack on my desk and stood. "Ready?"

"Ready as I’ll ever be." Cyrus slapped his knees and rose. "If this weren’t about Audrey or my daughter, I’d almost enjoy this. Office work gets stale."

"Thrilled to oblige," I deadpanned.

We walked in silence to the foyer.

Cyrus’s daughter, Eleanor, looked nothing like the broken woman we’d rescued. Her dark brown hair was clean, though shadows still lingered under her eyes. She needed weight, but color had returned to her cheeks. A spark lit her gaze as we approached.

"Alpha Grayson." She bowed slightly before extending her hand. "Thank you for saving me. I haven’t had the chance to say it properly."

Though a few years older, I remembered us playing as kids. "I’d do it again without hesitation." I shook her hand, forcing a smile that didn’t reach my eyes.

"Let’s move. Daylight’s wasting." Theodore held the door open. Outside, the SUV idled. Theodore and Eleanor climbed in back while Cyrus claimed the driver’s seat before I could.

"Long drive ahead. Try to sleep," he muttered.

"What if I don’t wake up when we get there?"

"Take half. You’ll be fine." He tossed an unopened water bottle into my lap.

With a heavy sigh, I pulled out the pill bottle. The white tablets inside looked more like poison than relief.

I didn’t want to sleep. I needed to stay alert. But Cyrus’s words echoed: What if your exhaustion gets someone killed?

Snapping a pill in half, I dry-swallowed it.



###Chapter 487

"Wake up, sleeping beauty." A rough shake jolted me from darkness. My eyelids felt like lead weights as blinding sunlight assaulted my vision. The cacophony of car doors slamming and muffled voices made my head throb.

"Are we there?" My voice came out gravelly, my tongue thick with exhaustion.

"Close enough." Cyrus swung open the door and stepped out, leaving me to gather my scattered thoughts. Reality crashed over me like a tidal wave, stealing my breath. My muscles protested as I stretched, every fiber screaming for more rest. Twenty-four more hours would've been perfect. But Audrey wasn't home yet.

By the time I stumbled out of the car, the others were already laughing. "What's so funny?" I growled, rubbing my face.

"Nothing," Cyrus said with a smirk. "Thought you could visit the old man first while we scout ahead."

"Dominic will stay with Evelyn while I plant surveillance."

"Got comms?" I stifled a yawn.

"Right here." Cyrus produced a sleek black case, clicking it open to reveal tiny earpieces. We each took one, except Evelyn, who hesitated until Cyrus gently insisted, "You should listen in case we need your input."

Her hands trembled as she finally accepted one, fumbling until Dominic helped secure it.

"So no plan? Just wing it?" I eyed the dense forest ahead—a path I could navigate blindfolded by now.

"Exactly. Makes it more fun," Cyrus clapped my shoulder with too much enthusiasm.

"I've had enough 'fun' to last a lifetime." Without waiting, I plunged into the trees, maneuvering around familiar traps and fallen logs on autopilot.

The cabin came into view, chimney cold but shadows flickering behind grimy windows.

"I'll flank around back. Keep him occupied," Cyrus whispered through the earpiece.

"Watch for cameras." I ghosted through the tree line, replicating my last stealth approach.

"Roger that." His grin was audible.

I slipped inside and dropped into the same chair as before. This time, the old man hobbled in immediately, nearly tripping over his own feet when he saw me.

"For what I paid you, I expected better living conditions." I let my wolf surge forward, golden eyes bleeding to black. The old man's coffee cup clattered to the table, brown liquid sloshing over the edge.

"Jesus fucking Christ!"

"Our business hasn't been mutually beneficial." I leaned in, letting him count the sweat droplets on his forehead.

"Last time you showed up, you massacred Don Vittorio's entire convoy!" He wheezed, clutching his chest. "You've ruined me!"

"What did you expect? For me to let them sell her?" My wolf's snarl vibrated through my teeth. "You're either stupid or suicidal."

He backed toward the wall, eyes darting to a rusted hunting knife on the counter. "Killing me won't get you more intel."

"Intel?" I kicked his chair toward him with a screech of wood. "You've given me nothing but lies. Find something useful. Fast."

"Got the auction coordinates," Cyrus panted through the earpiece.

"There's nothing left!" the old man spat. "After your stunt, the Alphas shut down all local auctions. Private sales only now."

His gaze skittered away—a dead giveaway. "Swear on your life?" I relaxed into the chair, enjoying how his Adam's apple bobbed.

"What life? You've destroyed it!" He slammed his fist on the table, rattling the coffee cup.

"Show me the auction site. Prove you're not hiding anyone."

"Fine!" He stormed toward the door, his limp nearly sending him face-first into the dirt. Perfect. Now Cyrus could ransack the place undisturbed.

###Chapter 488

The stale air clung to my skin as we descended the creaking stairs.

"Don't see why you're dragging me down here again," the old man muttered, his voice rough with irritation. The darkness swallowed us whole until he flicked the lights on, revealing the same concrete bunker from before.

I wasn't here for a tour.

With my hands shoved in my pockets, I paced slowly, pretending to inspect the space. "Open that door," I commanded, nodding toward the reinforced metal entrance.

"Open it yourself," he snapped, rolling his eyes like I was wasting his time.

A low growl rumbled in my chest. "You can do it willingly, or I'll make you." My wolf's voice was lethally calm, each word deliberate.

Even if I hadn't been furious, watching him squirm under my dominance was satisfying. His face twisted in resentment as he hobbled forward, moving painfully slow.

"Nothing in there worth seeing," he muttered under his breath, though he knew I could hear him perfectly.

"Forgive me if I don't take your word for it," I said dryly.

The door groaned as he turned the knob. Fluorescent lights flickered to life, revealing rows of chain-linked cages lining the walls, each secured with heavy-duty locks. The back of the room was nothing but cold concrete.

Drains dotted the floor of every cell, but it was the dark stains that caught my attention—blood, old and dried. No windows. No ventilation.

The stench hit me like a physical blow, making my eyes water. "What the hell is that smell?"

"Rotting flesh, most likely," he answered with a shrug. "After you took out the convoy, the alphas turned on each other. Few didn’t make it. Bodies were only cleared out this morning." His tone was disturbingly indifferent. Death was just another part of his routine.

"Anything else scheduled down here?"

"Not anymore. Had a cockfight planned, but that’s canceled." He didn’t bother asking if I was done. He just flipped the lights off and headed for the exit.

I followed him up the stairs. "So what’s next for you now that your business is ruined?"

"None of your damn concern."

I smirked. "Is that what you think?" Without waiting for an answer, I turned and strode toward the woods.

"Lose my number! We’re done!" he shouted after me.

I glanced back, letting my wolf surge forward just enough for my voice to drop into something dangerous. "We’re done when I say we’re done."

This time, I didn’t wait for a response.

The small victory of bugging his house lifted my spirits slightly. It wasn’t much, but it was something.

"Cutting it close there," Cyrus joked as he jogged past me.

"Losing your edge, old man?" I almost smiled. Almost.

"Nah, just enjoying the undercover work. Used to be my specialty before fatherhood and alpha duties." He reached the SUV before I did, already pulling out his earpiece and sliding into the driver’s seat.

"Ready?" I asked Nora and Cyrus as I climbed into the passenger side.

"Ready as I'll ever be," Nora sighed.

"Here, Cyrus. You’re on bug duty." Grayson tossed him a laptop before starting the engine.

"Fantastic," Cyrus muttered, taking it and slumping back in his seat.

"Alright, we're retracing the route you were on when Sebastian intercepted you. How long were you on that road?" Grayson pulled onto the highway, heading toward the ambush site.

"I don’t know. The road twisted so much. There were bumps—maybe railroad tracks?"

"That helps," Grayson nodded.

I pulled up a map on my phone, scanning for any railroad crossings that might narrow it down. "Anything else? Sounds? Smells?"

"Just… skunks, I think." Her voice faltered. When I glanced back, she was chewing her lip, frustration tightening her features.

"Factories nearby would have strong smells—sickly sweet or like rotting meat. Anything like that?"

She closed her eyes, straining to remember.

I didn’t push.

We reached the ambush site. The only remnants were scorch marks on the asphalt. My wound had healed, but the memory lingered.

"This is where you saved me," Nora whispered.

Grayson slowed the car, scanning the area.

"Yeah. Your vehicle flipped there. The others wrecked over there." I pointed to each spot. "We used a grenade launcher since the spike strips missed your car."

"I survived a grenade launcher?" Her eyes widened.

"Somehow, yeah. Everyone else was dead—or would’ve been when it blew. No idea how you walked away with so little damage."

"Can we keep moving?" she asked, rubbing her arms as if shaking off a chill.

Grayson accelerated. "Focus. Try to remember how far you traveled. Work backward."

"I don’t see any railroad tracks nearby," I murmured, still studying the map.

"Where are Sebastian’s men?" Grayson asked.

The question hung in the air, unanswered.
###Chapter 489

"They're surveilling the casino where Matteo was last seen. Haven't gotten any updates yet."

I pulled out my phone and shot them a quick text, asking for any new intel. Cyrus wasn’t driving particularly fast, but the tension in the car was suffocating. Evelyn leaned forward between Cyrus and me, her gaze fixed on the road ahead.

"Could there be an airstrip nearby?"

Cyrus glanced at her sharply. "Why do you ask?"

"I heard a plane—really close. Not sure if it was taking off or landing, but it made the whole car shake."

Unlocking my phone, I pulled up the map and scanned the area. "Nothing shows up on the GPS..."

"Actually," Nathan chimed in from the back, "this area’s full of farmland. There might be an old, abandoned airstrip someone’s repurposed." He snapped his fingers as if recalling something.

I set my phone down, exhaling. "If that’s the case, it could be anywhere."

"We drove on gravel for a while," Evelyn added hesitantly.

"Not exactly narrowing it down," I muttered, frustration creeping into my voice. This was a long shot, but damn if I wasn’t clinging to hope.

"It might," Nathan countered. "Turn here."

A gravel road appeared on our left. Cyrus slammed on the brakes, and my arm shot out instinctively to brace against the dashboard. Evelyn wasn’t so lucky—her body lurched forward, smacking into the center console. Cyrus tried to catch her but only managed to bloody her nose.

"Shit!" My wolf snarled as Cyrus jerked the wheel onto the gravel path.

"Ow!" Evelyn clutched her nose, wincing as she slumped back into her seat.

"Here."

Nathan handed her a towel from the back. He helped her press it to her nose, then turned his attention back to the road.

"Is she okay?" Cyrus asked, guilt lacing his voice.

"Drive up that hill," Nathan instructed, nodding ahead.

I wasn’t sure what his plan was, but Cyrus obeyed, steering us up the steep incline. It was more of a small mountain than a hill, but it was the only elevation for miles. Only when we reached the summit did I realize Nathan’s reasoning—from here, we could see for miles.

Cyrus parked at the highest vantage point, killing the engine. "You good?" he asked, turning to Evelyn.

She met his gaze, dabbing at her nose. "I’ve survived worse."

Tossing the towel aside, she pushed open the door and stepped out. Cyrus exhaled sharply, absorbing her words. Nathan and I exchanged a glance before following her.

"Got binoculars?" I asked as the wind whipped around us.

"Yeah." Nathan jogged back to the SUV.

The landscape stretched endlessly before us—flat, open, impossible to hide anything. "See anything?" Evelyn’s voice startled me as she appeared at my side.

"Yes—no." I squinted, catching a faint trail of smoke drifting across the fields.

"Here." Nathan shoved a pair of binoculars into my hands.

Adjusting the focus, I zeroed in on the movement. "Well, I’ll be damned," I murmured.

"What is it?" Cyrus demanded.

"A train."

"Seriously?" Evelyn’s voice pitched higher.

"Get a map. Track this," I ordered Nathan.

Cyrus and Nathan’s voices faded into background noise as I kept scanning. A few crop dusters buzzed low over the fields, but nothing that would suggest an active airstrip.

"We might have to drive down that road and see where it leads," Cyrus said, snapping me back to the present.

"That road isn’t even on the map. Who owns this land?" Nathan asked.

Cyrus pulled out his phone. "According to records... Nightshade LLC."

My heart stuttered. "Say that again."

"Nightshade LLC. They own thousands of acres of farmland and multiple businesses."

"If Damian owned all this, it would’ve passed to his heir. Dominic was his only son. Now that Audrey’s Alpha, this land belongs to her," Nathan said, awe coloring his tone.

"Which means she owns that casino," Cyrus added, sounding almost giddy.

"I wonder if Matteo knows that little detail." This could be leverage—Audrey’s rightful land, and they were trespassing.

"They might’ve fully infiltrated this area. That’s how the railroad’s gone unnoticed. Think about how many packs border this territory—they’ve been using it as neutral ground," Cyrus mused, staring at the vast expanse.

"This is what we’ve been missing," Nathan said. "They’ve turned this into their base."

Excitement warred with unease. "This is huge. How do we investigate without being detected?"

"Send a chopper to scout from the air. Ground recon’s too risky," Nathan suggested.

"They’ve probably got Audrey here. They think it’s hidden enough to avoid detection," Evelyn said, speaking up for the first time.

She wasn’t wrong. "Audrey?" I reached out through the mind-link, hoping against hope. It was our only connection—if they hadn’t drugged her, I might still reach her. If I could, she’d be within a few miles.

###Chapter 490
Audrey's POV

"Audrey! Are you alright? You've been in there forever!" Rosalie's persistent knocking rattled the bathroom door. My emotions toward her were tangled—I couldn't decide if I wanted to scream or cry.

I braced myself against the vanity, my knuckles white from gripping the edge. The contractions had been relentless, but I refused to believe this was real labor. Everything I'd read said contractions followed a pattern—steady intervals, growing intensity. But mine? They came in unpredictable waves, vanishing for brief respites before crashing back with brutal force. Just when I thought they'd stopped after breakfast, they returned with a vengeance.

BANG! BANG! The door handle jiggled violently. "Audrey! I'm seriously worried now!"

Fury surged through me like wildfire. I yanked the door open, glaring at her with enough heat to melt steel. "I'm nine months pregnant with triplets. If I need thirty damn minutes in the bathroom, you let me have them!"

The outburst shocked even me. The anger evaporated as quickly as it had flared, replaced by instant guilt. My shoulders slumped as I exhaled, the fire in my veins cooling to embers.

Rosalie stumbled back, eyes wide. "I-I'm sorry! You've just been so pale today, and the doctor's arriving any minute—"

"I just need to wash my hands," I muttered, shutting the door softly this time.

That surge of power... it had felt good. But also terrifying. I turned the faucet on, letting the water run while I stared at my reflection, trying to process what had just happened.

"Where is she?" The doctor's voice cut through the apartment, sharp with impatience.

"In the bathroom. She'll be out soon," Rosalie replied, her tone dismissive.

"Your attitude needs adjustment." His words sent ice down my spine.

I flung the door open just in time to see the doctor's hand clamped around Rosalie's throat, her feet dangling inches above the ground, face turning purple.

"Ah, perfect. You've decided to join us." He dropped Rosalie like a discarded toy. She hit the floor with a sickening thud.

Any sympathy I'd harbored for her vanished. She glared up at him, gasping. "No one in this damn place has any patience."

I waddled to the couch, lowering myself with a wince. The doctor's glare followed me, but he said nothing as he prepped his needles and IV bag.

"Drink this." Rosalie shoved a murky green concoction into my hands.

"What is it?" I flinched as the needle pierced my skin.

A fresh contraction seized me—worse than before. Braxton Hicks my ass.

"Vitamins and minerals. Keeps the babies strong." Rosalie's pitying look made my stomach churn.

I gulped it down, the bitter liquid coating my throat. Almost instantly, my gut revolted. "Nope. Not happening—" I shoved the glass back at her just before vomiting all over the doctor's pristine white coat.

"Are you kidding me?!" He leapt up, face twisted in rage.

"NO!" Rosalie threw herself between us—right as his fist connected with her eye.

I gasped, doubling over from a fresh contraction.

"You're in labor?" The doctor panted, his jacket stained green. His eyes darkened, wolf flashing in their depths.

Fear paralyzed me.

"You dare lay a hand on her?" A new voice boomed through the room.

Two armed guards flanked the doorway as Don Vittorio Romano strode in, his presence suffocating. "My men reported... disturbances." His voice was a blade wrapped in velvet.

"This bitch puked on me!" The doctor jabbed a finger at his ruined coat.

"So you struck the nurse?" Don Vittorio's gaze flicked to Rosalie's swelling eye.

"I jumped in front of Audrey!" Rosalie spat. "He was going to hit her!"

The don tilted his head, hands sliding into his pockets. "Is this true, Doctor? Did you intend to strike a pregnant woman over vomit?"

"She's in labor—it wouldn't have hurt the babies! You said healthy deliveries were the priority!" The doctor's bravado cracked, sweat beading on his brow. "I broke no rules. She wasn't harmed."

"Only because the nurse intervened." Don Vittorio snapped his fingers.

The guards seized the doctor's arms. "NO! I followed the rules!" His screams faded as they dragged him out.

The don turned to me, his obsidian eyes unreadable. "So. You're in labor?"
###Chapter 491
Grayson POV

"Let's move. The SUV's waiting, and we're following this road wherever it takes us." Cyrus turned on his heel and strode back to the vehicle.

My chest tightened when Audrey didn’t respond to my mind-link. I knew the odds were slim, but I needed just a shred of hope—anything to confirm she was unharmed. Our bond still pulsed faintly, proof she was alive, but the silence gnawed at me. What hell was she trapped in?

A heavy hand clamped onto my shoulder. I turned to see Sebastian giving me that familiar, knowing look. "We’ll find her."

I didn’t reply. Just yanked open the passenger door and dropped into the seat. Cyrus fired up the engine, the SUV lurching forward as we descended the hill. Then, out of nowhere, Charlotte materialized between us.

"After the tracks, go left—no, right! Wait, left!" She chewed her lip, frustration twisting her features.

Cyrus shot her a glance. "Did they turn before or after crossing?"

"Yeah, they—I…" She hesitated, fingers twisting in her lap.

"Spit it out," I snapped before Cyrus could.

"I tried to jump. Failed. They swerved, and I slammed into the wall instead of the door. Then the tracks—every bump cracked my skull against the floor. That’s why they cuffed me to the damn wall."

Cyrus’s jaw locked as he veered right. The railroad tracks loomed ahead. We slowed, tires crunching over gravel before the road hooked left.

"Stop." My instincts screamed. This path reeked of danger.

Sebastian frowned. "Problem?"

"We go on foot. Hide the SUV. Charlotte stays."

Her eyes flashed. "Seriously?"

I twisted in my seat, glare sharp enough to slice. "You really wanna walk back into where they broke you?" My control frayed, wolf snarling beneath my skin.

"He’s right. Stay put." Cyrus reversed, tucking the SUV into the tree line.

"I can help!" She grabbed my sleeve as I shoved the door open.

"Stay. Hidden. Don’t screw this up." My eyes bled to gold, and she recoiled. This was bigger than her guilt. Bigger than my rage.

The door slammed. Fury burned through me—visions of Lorenzo’s blood, his men choking on their own teeth, Audrey safe in my arms. Cyrus stepped into my line of sight, blocking it all.

"Focus."

"I am." The growl ripped from me.

"Try harder."

"You don’t get it!" I wheeled, driving my fist into a tree. Bark split. Knuckles split wider. Only when crimson streaked the trunk did Cyrus grip my shoulder.

"Ready?"

"Move." I sucked in air, forcing calm as we ghosted through the woods. Then—"Down." I hauled Cyrus behind an oak.

He pressed flat. "What?"

"Camera. We circle back."

The second the words left my mouth, alarms shrieked.

Cyrus’s eyes widened. "Go!"

We bolted. Bullets shredded foliage at our heels. "Cover your faces!" I barked. If luck held, they wouldn’t ID us. The SUV roared to life as we vaulted inside. Cyrus floored it before the doors shut. Tires spat gravel as we fishtailed onto the tracks, then asphalt.

Sebastian twisted in his seat. "That place needs a full assault team."

I watched the rearview, but no one followed. Then my phone buzzed.

"Alpha Grayson."

"No movement at the casino. All quiet," reported one of Sebastian’s men.

"Fall back to pack lands. We’ve got a lead." I hung up as sunset bled across the highway. Three hours in, Charlotte finally dozed off.

I was debating a second pain pill when my phone rang again. Sebastian’s name flashed.

"Talk."

"How far out are you?" No hello. Just tension.

"Few hours. Why?"

"Massive movement on our borders. Cameras caught something… unnatural."

"Send it."

The image hit my screen. My stomach dropped. "Sebastian, that’s Lorenzo’s wolves. He’s attacking."

"No shit. Look at the numbers."

I zoomed in. What I’d mistaken for trees was an ocean of fur—thousands. "Holy hell."

Cyrus stiffened. "Report."

"Lorenzo’s sending an army. They’re miles from our territory."

"Lunas are secure. Warriors are positioned. Just get here!" Sebastian hung up.

"Faster!" I snarled at Cyrus.

The SUV launched forward, pinning me to the seat. Speedometer kissed triple digits.

"How long?" My wolf itched to shift, to run the distance on four legs.


###Chapter 492

My wolf was fast, but not fast enough to outrun the terror gnawing at my insides. Every mile between me and my pack was a fresh wound, my skin prickling with restless energy. The need to protect them was a living, breathing thing inside me, clawing at my ribs.

Each warrior’s pain echoed through the bond like a knife twisting in my gut. They were trained—brutally, relentlessly—but nothing could prepare them for this. Mutant wolves. Monsters we knew nothing about. And I had no idea what defenses we even had left.

Sebastian’s call had been a small mercy. At least they’d had time to prepare. He’d said the Lunas were secured in the panic room. Evelyn was safe, but the scent of blood in the air was thick, intoxicating. My claws had unsheathed without thought, my body halfway shifted before I even realized it. Nora’s whimper snapped me back—just enough to notice the fangs in my mouth, the coarse fur sprouting along my arms.

Being an Alpha made my wolf massive. Being mated to a true female Alpha made me something else entirely.

Cyrus and Donovan flinched every time another warrior fell. Cyrus kept himself leashed, claws only half-extended, but Donovan was as far gone as I was. Our wolves hungered for violence, but mine? Mine wanted annihilation.

We were close now. Minutes away. The snarls and howls of battle reached my ears, and my grip on the door handle had nearly crushed it. Finally. My wolf would get his vengeance. If Lorenzo was here, he wouldn’t leave alive.

Donovan didn’t bother slowing as he drove straight through the gates, the SUV screeching to a halt in the courtyard. My wolf didn’t wait for the door to open—he tore it off its hinges. His roar shook the earth, freezing the battlefield for one terrifying second.

Every eye turned to me.

And then my wolf took over completely.

I didn’t fight him. This ancient, bloodthirsty beast had been holding back for too long. He lunged into the fray, a blur of fangs and claws. The mutants came at him in waves, and he tore through them like they were nothing. Heads rolled. Hearts were ripped from chests. Blood painted the grass beneath his paws.

He didn’t just kill. He protected. Any warrior struggling against the mutants found him at their side in an instant, ripping their attackers apart.

Pride burned in my chest. This was my wolf. My other half. He carried my rage, my pain, so I could stay focused. But the anger wasn’t gone. Not yet. Not until Audrey was back in my arms.

By the time the last mutant fell, the battlefield was littered with bodies. My wolf stalked toward the wounded ones, ignoring the warriors who tried to speak. One look silenced them.

Then he finished what he’d started.

Bones snapped. Throats were torn out. The mutants’ dying growls were a symphony of vengeance, and with each one, my wolf’s fury ebbed just a little.

When it was done, he lifted his head and howled, unleashing his Alpha aura in a crushing wave. Every wolf—even the other Alphas—dropped to their knees.

Only then did he let me take control again.

I staggered as I shifted back, landing on one knee, breathing hard. The adrenaline was fading, leaving exhaustion in its wake, but beneath it, I felt alive. Clear-headed.

"Alpha Grayson."

A warrior from another pack approached, head bowed, holding out a pair of shorts. I took them without a word.

"Warriors!" I barked. "Clean this up."

Instantly, they moved, gathering our dead and piling the mutants for burning.

"Grayson!" Sebastian’s voice cut through the chaos, sharp with urgency. His eyes told me everything before he even spoke.

"Who?" I demanded.

"It’s Evelyn. She’s in labor."

My heart stopped.

If Evelyn was in labor, Audrey would be too—if she hadn’t already given birth.

"Go," I growled.

Sebastian hesitated, conflict flashing across his face. I knew what he wanted to say—that he should stay, fight with me. But I shook my head.

He gripped my shoulder, then took off running.

"Grayson," Donovan said, pulling my attention back. "We don’t have time. Clean up. Meet the Alphas in your office. We leave in hours."

I looked down at myself. Blood coated every inch of me. Part of me wanted to keep it—to walk into that casino drenched in the evidence of what I’d done.

I needed to send a message.

And it would be written in red.



###Chapter 493

The hot water from the shower had barely dried on my skin when I strapped on my tactical gear. The only personal item I wore was the obsidian necklace I'd given Audrey. Its weight against my chest was a reminder—she was still with me in spirit. A single strand of her hair clung to the chain, carrying her scent. I inhaled deeply, letting it ground me. I had to stay sharp. For her. To return this necklace to her myself.

My office was already packed when I entered. Every alpha stood huddled around my desk, their focus locked on something spread across the surface. Cyrus glanced up as I approached. "Good, you're here." His voice was clipped before his attention dropped back to the documents.

"What's this?" I asked, stepping forward. Grayson and Oliver shifted to make space for me between them.

Cyrus traced a red outline with his finger. "My men mapped out the territory that now legally belongs to Audrey—and by extension, you."

"The casino sits right here," Cyrus continued, tapping a marked spot. "This is where we were last night."

Oliver's finger followed a faint blue dotted line. "This is the unregistered railroad. Completely off-grid. No government records."

Cyrus circled several other points. "These are suspected holding cells. Aerial footage from updated satellite images shows barred windows."

"That was last year's data," Nathan cut in. "We need to prepare for changes. New structures, shifted defenses—anything. We're going in blind."

Sebastian nodded. "Their security mirrors ours. Motion sensors, cameras, the works. Last time, it took five men coordinating from different angles just to get close."

"But you did get close," Oliver said, his gaze locking onto mine with a confidence I didn’t feel. "We’ll do it again. More men. Better intel."

Cyrus’s voice turned steel. "You will do it again. Audrey’s life depends on it."

"—And your children’s," Nathan finished.

"I’m not arguing that," I snapped. "I’m asking where. Do we storm the casino first? Hit the scattered buildings? If we’re too slow, they’ll move her."

"That’s why we split up," Cyrus said. "Each team takes a sector. My black ops unit handles the casino—I’ve got blueprints." He slapped down another map.

Sebastian leaned in. "If she’s there, she’ll be in the basement or a secured suite."

Dominic traced the layout. "We clear it floor by floor."

Lorenzo nodded. "Cameras will cover every stairwell. We loop into their feed or breach the security room."

Something nagged at me. "What if she’s not there? What if they’ve got another location—something not on any map?"

Cyrus exhaled. "We don’t have time for more recon. We move now. Six teams. Gear up—we leave in two hours."

The alphas filed out, leaving only Cyrus. Once the door shut, he kept talking. "Sebastian’s men know their security systems. They back you up at the casino. I’ll take the security room and guide your team to Audrey."

"Oliver and Grayson work well together—they’ll hit these outbuildings. Dominic and Lorenzo scout this open zone. Too much empty space for it to be nothing."

"Nathan’s team takes the railroad. Both ends."

I tensed. "That’s a massive area for one team."

"Sebastian won’t leave Evelyn. Nathan’s the best for this—he’s handled worse."

"Do we even have enough men? They’ll have mutants, regulars, allies. After last night, they’ll be on high alert."

Cyrus met my eyes. "Honestly? I don’t know. But our men are trained. They’re hungry. And after what your wolf did yesterday? They’ll follow you into hell."

His pride was almost paternal. "I hope Audrey realizes the power she carries. I doubt she’s ever fully tapped into her wolf."

I smirked. "You’d be shocked what a mother will do to protect her children. That wolf’s in there. And when the time comes? She’ll tear throats out."

"Let’s hope so." I clung to that hope as he clasped my shoulder. "Check on Evelyn. Meet me out front after."

"Tell her I’m rooting for her," Cyrus said, offering his hand.

I shook it firmly before heading out. One last check on Evelyn—then it was time to bring Audrey home.



###Chapter 494

The hospital corridors stretched before me, each step heavier than the last. My love for Evelyn was boundless—once, I believed nothing could ever surpass it. Now, I had to force a smile, knowing the sight of her cradling her newborn would tear at my heart until I held my own children.

"Grayson?"

I hadn’t noticed Oliver approaching, my gaze fixed on the floor as I moved toward Evelyn’s room. His voice snapped me back. "What are you doing here?" I asked, struggling to steady my emotions.

"Came to see the baby before we left. Same as you, I assume?" Oliver turned, gesturing for me to follow.

"I am."

He knocked three times. The door cracked open just enough for him to speak to whoever stood inside. "Grayson’s here."

"Let him in." Evelyn’s voice was soft but warm. The door swung wider, and Sebastian stepped aside.

Evelyn was nursing the baby when I entered. The sight was a dagger to my chest, but I forced a grin. "How are you feeling?" I cleared my throat, stepping closer to peer at the tiny bundle in her arms. The baby looked serene, her delicate features peaceful.

"Surprisingly good. The delivery was quick. Here, meet your niece." Evelyn gently shifted the baby, wiping her face before handing her to me. The little girl blinked up at me with the bluest eyes I’d ever seen.

"She’s perfect." The smile that spread across my face was genuine. A wave of warmth rushed through me as her tiny fingers curled around mine.

"Technically, she’s your daughter too. We share the same DNA." Evelyn chuckled as she adjusted her clothes.

"What did you name her?" I moved to the chair, giving her privacy while cradling the baby. Her soft coos were a balm to my soul.

"I haven’t gotten your blessing yet," Evelyn said hesitantly. "We don’t have to decide now."

"Adalynn is beautiful for my niece. But Audrey and I are naming our daughter Eliana."

"Eliana?" Evelyn’s eyes lit up. "That’s gorgeous. Who chose it?" She leaned back, smiling as Sebastian stood at the foot of the bed, arms crossed, watching her with quiet devotion.

"No idea. When I was unconscious, I saw visions of my children—all of them had names."

"Audrey did say you were acting strange about the baby blankets." Evelyn laughed softly, glancing at Sebastian. "Come here."

He moved to her side, sitting on the edge of the bed. "What do you need?"

"I need you to go with Grayson and bring Audrey back. He’s not okay, and you remember how it was when I was gone—and I wasn’t even pregnant. Bring my sister-in-law home, then come back to us."

"Scarlett, we’ve got it handled. Sebastian needs to stay with you." I stood, carefully passing the baby back to her.

"I disagree. You stood by him to get me back. Now he’ll stand by you. I’ll be fine—Oliver’s staying with me. Really, I’m okay." She placed a hand on Sebastian’s chest, her gaze locking with his.

I couldn’t look away as Evelyn traced a finger over Adalynn’s cheek. "We’re strong, but only as strong as our family. Grayson needs us. Go."

"Are you sure?" Sebastian’s conflict was palpable.

"It’s really okay, Scarlett." I rested a hand on her head. Our eyes met, and I saw the truth in hers—she always knew. Call it twin intuition, but she saw straight through me. There was no resentment, only sincerity.

"I’m serious. Sebastian was here for the birth. Now he needs to be there for you. Sophia will help me. Just bring him back."

"I’ll give you two a minute." I leaned down, pressing a kiss to her forehead. "Love you, Evelyn," I whispered before straightening.

I was nearly at the door when her voice stopped me. "Love you too, Grayson. Bring Audrey home—and those babies."

My breath caught. She’d said it aloud before, but it still stunned me every time. With a final smile, I stepped out and shut the door behind me.

"I’m heading back," I told Oliver. Without waiting for a response, I strode down the hall. Adalynn had given me another reason to stay focused. Three babies were waiting for me, and I would bring them home.

By the time I reached the packhouse, Nathan was briefing everyone on their assignments. "How’s it going?" I asked, joining Ethan’s side.

"Everyone knows their roles. They’re organizing now. Some men need reassignment—we’ll need earpieces for all." Nathan spread a map across the ground, weighing the corners with rocks as the wind tugged at the edges.

"Expected."

"The tech team needs time to breach the casino’s security. Timing has to be perfect."

"Do we have floor plans?" I asked, my mind sharpening.

"Yeah." Nathan grabbed a briefcase, pulling out more papers. "Four floors of standard rooms, three of suites—two per floor, one on each side."

"Meaning two teams per group." I nodded. "Let’s move."



###Chapter 495
Audrey POV

GODDAMN IT! The contractions were still spaced out, but each one felt like being struck by lightning. "I can call the doctor for an epidural," Rosalie offered, rubbing my lower back as I hunched over in agony.

I was pacing the room when another wave hit, forcing me to grip the windowsill until my knuckles turned white. After Matteo left, they'd brought in more medical equipment—all of which I demanded they drape with sheets. The sterile smell alone made my stomach churn.

"No drugs," I gritted out. There was no way I'd let them numb me. Not when I might need to fight. Not when they could try to steal my babies the second they were born. I needed to stay alert.

"Drink this." Rosalie pressed a water bottle into my trembling hands. "You're dehydrated. And after the blood they took, you'll feel weak." Her voice was hoarse from earlier, her split lip still swollen.

"How much longer?" I panted, resuming my slow circles around the couch. They'd confined me to this room, so pacing was my only option. The adult diaper Rosalie insisted I wear chafed with every step—just one more humiliation in this nightmare.

"First delivery? With triplets?" She exhaled sharply. "Your contractions aren't close enough. Could be tomorrow. Maybe longer. Natural births take time."

I bit my tongue. The pain was worth it if it bought Grayson more time to find me. Every minute these babies stayed inside was a victory.

Sweat slicked my forehead. My wolf had been restless all day, flooding my veins with adrenaline. She sensed danger. Which meant help was coming.

The door slammed open mid-contraction. "Your new physician," announced Don Vittorio, ushering in a man in a white coat. The doctor barely glanced up from his clipboard.

Bald. Cold eyes. Rosalie's sudden tension beside me made my wolf snarl to the surface.

"Dr. Holloway. You'll need Pitocin to accelerate labor," he stated, snapping gloves onto his hands.

"I refuse medical intervention," I spat through clenched teeth.

"Actually, you consented to treatment per your agreement with Don Vittorio," he countered smoothly. "Triplets require monitoring. Unless you'd prefer a C-section?"

My blood turned to ice.

"Or shall I remind you of the consequences of noncompliance?" The Don folded his hands, that serpent's smile making my skin crawl. "Your children become mine the moment they draw breath."

The trap snapped shut.

"Bed. Now." The doctor powered up the ultrasound machine.

Rosalie's whisper was fierce. "Just comply."

Tears burned but I swallowed them. I'd endure anything to protect my babies.

"Excellent decision." The Don's grin widened as I climbed onto the mattress.

"This isn't for them. This is for you." My wolf's growl vibrated through my chest, startling everyone but him.

"Good. You'll need that fire." With a mocking bow, he exited.

"Let's check dilation," Dr. Holloway ordered.

"Don Vittorio promised no male physicians would examine her," Rosalie cut in, stepping between us.

"Shall I recall him to verify?" The doctor's wolf flashed in his eyes.

Rosalie didn't flinch. "By all means."

A tense silence. Then he jerked his chin toward the gel bottle. "Fine. But I'm doing the ultrasound."

The cold gel hit my stomach as the screen flickered to life. "Three centimeters," Rosalie reported, her tone sharp enough to make the doctor scowl.

"Remarkable. All three are vertex position." He sounded almost disappointed. "You may deliver vaginally after all."

"Fantastic," I deadpanned.

"Starting Pitocin now to speed—"

"Medically unnecessary," Rosalie snapped. "She's progressing normally. The babies are stable."

The doctor's smile turned dangerous. "Choose your next words carefully, nurse. You're expendable."

###Chapter 496
Grayson POV

"We can manage that. One suite per wing of the building." Cyrus was tallying the warriors who would join our team.

"Where do you need me?" Sebastian's voice cut through the tension behind me.

I rose to my feet, meeting his gaze with a measured look. "You don’t have to come."

"You're my brother. I'm going. Stop arguing and tell me where I’m needed." He extended his hand toward me. After a brief hesitation, I clasped it, and he pulled me into a rough half-hug. "Always."

"Thanks, man."

"You'll assist with the train takedown," Cyrus began, scanning the room for Cyrus.

"I think we’ve got that covered," Cyrus interjected as he approached. "My gamma is more than capable. Sebastian would be more useful at the casino retrieving Audrey. He knows his men, and I don’t anticipate much resistance with the train."

"You sure? I’ll do whatever’s necessary," Sebastian pressed, concern flickering in his eyes.

"Positive. We’re derailing it—should be straightforward. The priority is firepower. If you’ve got long-range rifles or automatics, bring them. They’ll help neutralize any mutants."

"We’ve got that covered. Sebastian, show him the armory and let him pick what he needs." I nodded in agreement. The plan sounded solid—but nothing about this mission would be easy.

A realization struck me like lightning. "Wait, we’ve strategized everything except how to dismantle his mutant operation. We need to locate his lab and destroy it." How had none of us thought of this sooner?

Cyrus exhaled sharply. "I’m hoping we’ll uncover it during the raids. This is our only lead, and honestly, we have no proof what we’re after is even there. We could walk away empty-handed."

He wasn’t wrong, but my gut insisted we were on the right path. It had to be. The alternative was unthinkable. If this failed, we’d have nothing left.

"Grayson, come brief the men on the plan." Sebastian clapped my shoulder, gesturing toward his warriors gathered around the casino blueprints.

"Let me grab my team so everyone’s clear," Cyrus said before jogging off to another group.

Sebastian commanded attention, and the men made space. Kneeling, I ensured everyone could see me. Once Cyrus returned with his fighters, I began.

I pointed to five trusted non-family warriors. "Your job is to infiltrate the security room undetected. The entire operation hinges on this."

"Do we know its exact location?" Enzo asked.

"Basement level, according to the blueprints. But when we met Don Vittorio Romano, his office was down there too. It won’t be easy to pinpoint."

Cyrus knelt beside me, tracing a route with his finger. "This is the best approach, but once inside, you’ll need to improvise."

"Reassuring," someone muttered. I didn’t blame them.

"Once you’re in, guide us to Audrey. The rest of us will split into two teams, clearing one floor at a time. You’ll be our eyes and ears. Minimize casualties, and keep our presence hidden until we have Audrey secured. Ideally, we extract her before anyone realizes we’re there." Cyrus’s tone left no room for debate.

I stood, raising my voice. "Timing is critical. We strike the casino first. Find Audrey and get out before the other teams engage. No one moves prematurely—if they do, they could flee with her. There’s an airstrip nearby. If they get her on a plane, she’s gone forever. And if that happens..." I let the threat hang in the air.

"What Alpha Grayson means," Cyrus interjected, "is that mistakes aren’t an option. This is the most critical mission you’ll ever undertake. The future of our kind is at stake. You’ve faced these mutants—their brutality threatens us all. Every move must be precise. Every shot must count. We’re not just saving Luna Audrey and her children—we’re ending Lorenzo. Ending mutant production. Ending the trafficking of innocent lives. You were chosen for your skill, courage, and reliability. Every Alpha here trusts you. Prove to the world we won’t bow to anyone—not even the mafia. Now, bow your heads. Let’s pray to the Moon Goddess for victory."

By the time Cyrus finished, the room buzzed with fierce determination. As I bowed my head, three small faces flashed behind my eyelids—Audrey’s, and our unborn twins.

###Chapter 497

The SUV had been moving for hours. Sebastian was behind the wheel, his grip steady despite the tension thickening the air. This vehicle carried the most crucial cargo—medical supplies for Audrey and the twins. My stomach twisted at the sight of the tiny oxygen masks and emergency kits. Please, let them stay unused.

Only one unfamiliar face sat among us—a doctor from Maxwell’s pack. His combat skills were sharp, but his real purpose was clear. If anything went wrong, he’d be the one keeping Audrey alive.

I wasn’t trusted to drive. Not with my nerves frayed, my wolf pacing just beneath my skin. My fingers drummed against the console until Sebastian smacked my hand away. "Stop it," he muttered. But I couldn’t. Every second dragged, every mile closer to our target made my pulse spike.

We parked far from the casino, hidden in the tree line. The plan was precise—arrive early, scout, then strike. Jace, our tech genius, was running command from a makeshift base on the hill. If things went south, he’d pull us out.

The wind carried the scent of pine and damp earth as I approached him. "Right on schedule," Jace said, handing me an earpiece. Then, with a smirk, he added a few "extras"—chloroform, rags, grenades.

"Thanks."

My voice came out rougher than intended. A second later, my wolf surged forward, shoving me aside. Control slipped from my grasp. Good. He was better for this. More ruthless. More focused.

Sebastian arched a brow when he saw the gold bleeding into my eyes. "Ready?"

"Let’s go."

The forest swallowed us whole. No birds sang. No crickets chirped. The animals had fled, sensing predators in their midst.

A sharp snap of fingers froze me mid-step. Sebastian lifted binoculars, scanning ahead. Then—cameras. Dozens of them, hidden in the trees. Too many to disable.

So we climbed.

Wolves had advantages—claws for gripping bark, silent footfalls, instincts sharper than any human’s. We leapt from branch to branch, avoiding lenses and motion sensors. The thrill of outsmarting them burned through me.

Closer. Closer.

The casino’s noise grew—shouts, laughter, the clatter of slot machines. A cleaning van idled near a service entrance, its workers arguing.

"Hurry up, Ken! We don’t have all night!"

The van’s doors were open. Hoses snaked inside, leading straight into the building.

Alec’s voice crackled in my earpiece. "Go around. This side’s too exposed."

The team melted into the shadows.

Then—a distraction. A cleaner stormed off, cursing, cigarette dangling from his lips. He vanished into the trees.

Perfect.

"Cyrus in position," a voice murmured. "Train’s stationary."

"Thirty minutes for Anthony."

Sebastian exhaled. "Stand by for breach."

My wolf bared his teeth.

Tonight, blood would spill.
###Chapter 498

My pulse hammered violently, but my wolf steadied it. Each measured beat was like an anchor, keeping me from bolting straight toward Audrey.

"Audrey?" I reached out through the mind-link again.

"Grayson?" Her voice trembled, thick with unshed tears.

"Don’t react. Stay calm. What’s happening? Where are you?"

"I don’t know!" Her breath hitched, relief and terror warring inside her. "I’m in labor. There’s a nurse with me—the doctor just left."

"Audrey’s in labor," my wolf murmured to Sebastian and Dominic.

Their gazes snapped to me instantly. "What?" Sebastian demanded.

"Grayson’s linked with her. She’s here—and she’s giving birth."

Sebastian and Dominic exchanged a glance, their expressions hardening. "That changes things," Dominic muttered, pressing his earpiece. "Status?"

"Shifting positions now," came the reply.

"Audrey, do you know where you are?" I pressed, needing details. "Focus. I’m coming for you, but I need your help."

"I don’t know. It’s a suite—living room, bedrooms, a kitchen." Her voice steadied slightly.

"She’s in a private suite," my wolf relayed.

"Audrey, I love you. Breathe. Stay sharp. We’re coming. Don’t let them suspect anything—be ready. Can you do that?"

"Yes. For you. For our babies." A soft whimper escaped, but determination quickly replaced it.

"I need to focus, but I’ll keep the link open." My attention snapped to the warrior emerging from the trees.

"Please hurry. I’ll be ready."

"Move out," Dominic ordered, adjusting his stance. "Stay undetected." His men advanced toward the building. The ones in disguise slipped behind dumpsters.

The decoy in uniform lit a cigarette, his back turned.

"Still smoking, you idiot?" A guard stormed out, throwing his hands up.

Our man whipped out a cloth, muffling the guard’s shout as he dragged him behind the bins. Seconds later, he returned, casually smoking as if nothing happened.

Another guard emerged, yelling—same fate.

Five minutes later, our team reappeared in ill-fitting janitor uniforms, hats low. They grabbed cleaning supplies and entered the casino.

"Group one in position—heading to security," Dominic whispered.

Minutes later: "Ready for Lorenzo."

That was it. Now we waited.

Silence stretched until a sharp whisper cut through. "Someone’s coming! Get in here!"

Scuffling. A quiet click. Muffled voices.

"Stairs ahead. Rags ready?"

"Move!"

More shuffling. A groan. "Shit!" A brief scream, then silence.

"Burt? That you?" a distant voice called.

"Slipped!" Our man faked Burt’s voice.

"Slipped?" The guard wasn’t buying it.

My wolf’s ears twitched, every sound amplified.

"Damn it!" A struggle. A door slammed.

"That’s one of Matteo’s men!"

"Too late now. Keep moving!" A heavy thud.

"That won’t stay quiet for long."

"Probably not." More doors opened and closed. They were nearing the security room—or so we hoped.

"Not here," someone reported.

Dominic cursed. "Think. Where else?"

"One floor up," Sebastian cut in. "Utility room on the layout. Could be disguised."

"That’s also where Matteo’s office is," Dominic muttered.

Sebastian’s jaw tightened. "I know. But it’s not on ground level."

"Pray it’s not the main floor," Dominic agreed. "Stay hidden."

"Going dark." The team fell silent—too many ears nearby.

A limo rolled up to the back entrance. Guards swarmed, forming a path.

A suited man stepped out, opening the door. "Don Vittorio! Don Lorenzo! Glad you arrived safely."

Matteo and Lorenzo stepped out, their presence like a storm rolling in.
###Chapter 499

"Grazie. This will be an unforgettable evening." Don Vittorio chuckled as they stepped inside. The limousine disappeared into the night while his men followed closely behind him and Lorenzo.

My wolf nearly tore through my skin. Both Sebastian and Nathan had to grip my arms to restrain me. The pressure of their fingers digging into my flesh was the only thing stopping me from charging into that casino. Audrey's life hung in the balance—along with our unborn children and every human inside blissfully unaware of the danger.

"Perfect. Saves me the trouble of hunting them down." My wolf's growl was so deep that Sebastian and Nathan exchanged a sharp glance before repositioning themselves, releasing me as they turned away.

I checked my watch. Ten minutes had passed since Sebastian's men last reported in. "Audrey, are you okay?" I asked again, more to fill the suffocating silence than anything else.

"Labor pains are worse than being mauled by a rogue," she hissed through gritted teeth, clearly in the middle of another contraction.

"I hate that I'm not there with you."

"Don't. Vittorio hasn't returned, so it's fine for now."

"Returned?" My wolf stiffened. "I just watched him arrive."

Audrey exhaled sharply. "Long story. I needed a different doctor. Vittorio brought one earlier today."

She sounded eerily calm. "Lorenzo won't touch me."

"Why not?"

"Part of my deal with Vittorio. I had no choice—I did what I had to for our babies. I was counting on you to get me out before things got worse."

Before I could respond, Sebastian's men crackled over comms. "Security room is secure."

"Vittorio and Lorenzo just entered the office," another voice reported. The sound of rapid keystrokes followed, then a sharp click of someone's tongue.

"We might need a diversion," Nathan muttered, his body twitching with restless energy.

"Already on it." The glee in the warrior's voice was unsettling. "Stand by."

I had no idea what to expect until I heard a door slam. "Take the next right, Enzo."

"What the hell are you doing?" Sebastian demanded.

"Creating chaos without tipping anyone off," came the smug reply.

"How?" Sebastian sounded increasingly wary.

"Got it—cameras are blind." Nathan, Sebastian, and I exchanged glances as laughter crackled through the comms. "Move now!"

"Damn, that was close!" Enzo's breathless chuckle echoed as he slipped back into the security room.

"Go! Get in position!" someone barked.

"What did you do?" Sebastian snapped as we vaulted down from our hiding spot, keeping low as we sprinted toward the casino.

"Take the left—stairs are clear," a voice directed.

"Enzo took out some drunk idiot, made him spill his drink on an electrical panel. Half the slot machines just went dark."

"You knocked someone out?" Nathan sounded furious.

"Chloroform, genius. Made it look like he passed out. Give me some credit."

"My mate and children are in there. If you screw this up, I'll show you exactly what happens next," my wolf snarled as we ascended the stairs.

"First door leads to the suites. Three floors. Luna Audrey is in one of them. Two teams—I see her on camera, but no floor marker. She's on the bed with an IV. One woman beside her, no other hostiles. Two suites per floor."

"Two guards at her door, plus one at each end of the hall. Silencers on."

Sebastian and Nathan immediately screwed suppressors onto their pistols. My hands were more claws than fingers now—guns weren't an option.

"On your mark," the comms announced.

Nathan scanned us all. "I take low, you take high. Left is mine, right is yours."

Sebastian nodded. Nathan shoved the door open, dropping to one knee as Sebastian stepped over him. The guards barely had time to react before gunfire erupted—headshots for the two nearest, body shots for the hallway sentries. Nathan emptied his clip into the last guard, but the man was still twitching.

Sebastian moved forward while Nathan lunged, pressing his gun to the guard's forehead and pulling the trigger. The body jerked, then stilled. Sebastian reached the first suite door, Nathan the second.

"Three… two… one!" Nathan counted down. Both teams stormed inside as I lingered in the hall, scanning each doorway for any sign of Audrey.

"Freeze!"

"Hands where we can see them!"

"Negative—no Audrey here!"

"Clear on this side too!"

"Restrain them—knock them out!" Nathan ordered.

This wasn't the right floor. Deep down, I knew she'd be on the third level—the hardest to reach. Pacing the hallway was agony as we waited for the teams to finish securing the rooms. No one could be allowed to escape and raise the alarm. Chloroform and zip ties for everyone.

"Status?" Sebastian demanded.
###Chapter 500
"Everything's going smoothly so far." The only sound was the faint clicking of keyboards in the background.

"Is there surveillance in Matteo's office?" Nathan questioned.

"Negative. This place is massive—we're all hands on deck monitoring the cameras."

I'd expected as much. A casino this size would require hundreds of cameras to cover every angle. Sebastian and his team emerged before Nathan's group did.

"Ready?" I asked him.

"Let's move."

We headed for the stairwell. Sebastian's hand was on the door when our earpieces crackled to life.

"Hold position. Civilians in the stairwell."

"Where'd they come from?" Nathan demanded.

"No clue. Didn't spot them until I double-checked. They've got the guy in the medical bay, and the slot machines are operational again. There's a camera near where we think Matteo's office is—should give us eyes on anyone coming or going. Can't pull up historical footage without dropping current surveillance."

A distant door creaked open then shut. "Clear now."

Sebastian shoved the door open, and we ascended silently to the next level. "Same guard count and positions as the previous floor," came the update in our earpieces.

My instincts screamed this still wasn't the right floor, but my wolf obeyed the directions. We had to be thorough. What if these rooms were just guard stations? What if Lorenzo was actually here?

"Go! Now!" Nathan hissed as he breached the door. This time, I didn't see the shots—just heard the suppressed clicks and the dull thuds of bodies hitting the floor. My wolf remained controlled, unlike before.

Sebastian and Nathan cleared the suites with lethal precision. "Well, well—new player just entered the game," chuckled the surveillance team, equal parts amused and intrigued.

"Who?" Sebastian growled.

"That auctioneer old-timer. Matteo's boys just dropped him off. Not exactly dragging him by the collar, but he's not walking in voluntarily either."

"Track their path. He's not our priority—Audrey is. Stay focused and hold positions!" My wolf snarled. We wouldn't lose her over him. If that was the sacrifice required, so be it.

"He just entered the hallway we flagged as Matteo's office. Lost visual now." We stood frozen in the corridor, waiting for updates.

Confirmation of the office's location settled my nerves. "Good. Keep watching. Second floor clear."

The urge to mind-link Audrey nearly overwhelmed me, but doubt held me back. What if we were wrong? False hope would destroy her. Just because we could connect didn't mean she was in the casino—she could be anywhere within a mile radius.

As we got clearance for the third floor, my body rebelled against the slow pace. "What if Audrey isn't here?" a warrior muttered.

Sebastian and Nathan froze. My wolf saw red. I loomed behind the questioning warrior, my growl vibrating against his ear. "This wing is all suites. We'll tear this place apart until we find her."

The warrior trembled, bowing his head in submission. "My office. After this," Sebastian bit out, his eyes flickering with his wolf's fury.

"Same guard setup as before," surveillance reported.

Third time's the charm, right? I braced for luck as Sebastian kicked the door in. My wolf barely restrained itself from charging before the gunfire stopped.

Sebastian and Nathan exchanged a glance before breaching. Then—a woman's scream from the left.

I didn't need orders. Didn't need the all-clear. That was her.

"Grayson?" Audrey's voice was a symphony. My wolf propelled me forward into the bedroom where she was restrained.

"Audrey!" I cradled her face, our lips crashing together. Tension bled from my shoulders as her tears mingled with our kiss. The salt on my tongue anchored me—I couldn't break down now.

"You're really here," she whispered, voice cracking. Then I was being nudged aside.

"Apologies, Alpha Grayson, but I need access." The doctor started adjusting IV lines.

"What are you doing?" a girl beside the bed demanded.

"Stopping the Pitocin. We can't deliver here. How far along is she?" He worked briskly, unhooking monitors.

"This is her physician. He'll manage her during transport. What's her dilation?" With Audrey beside me, the mental fog lifted. Clarity returned—and with it, control.
