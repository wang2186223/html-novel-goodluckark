###Chapter 1

My fingers tremble as I step out of the car, the weight of the moment pressing down on me. The mansion looms ahead, its grandeur a stark reminder of everything I’ve lost.

I still can’t believe it’s over. That after all this time, I’m finally free. The divorce papers sit heavily in my handbag, the final proof of the end. I’m here to deliver them—and to pick up Liam.

The house is eerily quiet as I step inside, the familiar scent of polished wood and expensive cologne wrapping around me. I follow the sound of hushed voices toward the kitchen but freeze just outside the doorway.

Their words slice through me like ice.

“Why can’t we all live together, Daddy?” Liam’s voice is small, uncertain.

My hand flies to my chest, my heart shattering at the sadness in his tone. I’d give anything to take his pain away, but this divorce was inevitable.

Our marriage was a mistake. Every single part of it. It just took me too long to realize.

“You know why, Liam,” Ethan Blackwood replies, his voice softer than I’ve ever heard it.

That’s the cruel irony. In all the years we were married, he never spoke to me like that. His words to me were always cold, flat, devoid of emotion.

“But why?” Liam presses.

“Sometimes things just… don’t work out,” Ethan mutters.

I can picture his expression—the slight frown, the way he’s trying to deflect before Liam asks the one question I dread.

But my son is relentless.

“Do you love Mommy?”

The air leaves my lungs. I press my back against the wall, my pulse roaring in my ears as I wait for his answer.

I already know it. I’ve always known. Everyone does—except Liam.

The truth is, Ethan never loved me. Not once. Not even for a second.

But still, I need to hear him say it. Will he lie to our son? Or will he finally speak the truth?

He hesitates. “Liam…”

“Do you love her or not?” Liam demands, his voice firm.

Ethan exhales sharply. “I love her for giving me you,” he finally says.

It’s not an answer. It’s a deflection.

I squeeze my eyes shut as pain floods through me. After all this time, it still hurts. A foolish part of me had hoped, just this once, he’d say something different.

He never told me he loved me. Not when we married. Not when I gave birth to Liam. Not in all the years that followed.

Our marriage was a prison. Just him, me, and the ghost of the woman he truly loved—the one he could never let go.

Tears sting my eyes, but I blink them away. I’m done crying over a man who never wanted me.

“Eavesdropping is rude, Sophia.”

His deep voice cuts through the silence, snapping me back to reality. I straighten my shoulders and step into the kitchen.

Ethan stands by the counter, his piercing grey eyes locking onto me with disdain. My ex-husband. The man who destroyed my heart a thousand times over.

My gaze shifts to Liam—my joy, my light. He has Ethan’s striking features but my warm brown hair.

“Hi,” I say softly.

“Mommy!” Liam abandons his half-eaten sandwich and rushes to me, wrapping his arms around my waist. “I missed you.”

“I missed you too, sweetheart,” I murmur, kissing his forehead before he pulls away.

Standing here feels wrong. This was never my home. Not really.

Ethan built this house for her. Every detail, every color—it was all for the woman he couldn’t have.

I should’ve known then that he’d never love me.

“What are you doing here?” Ethan snaps, glancing at his watch. “You promised not to interrupt my time with Liam.”

“I know,” I say, forcing calm into my voice. “But the divorce papers are finalized. I thought I’d bring your copy while picking Liam up.”

His expression hardens. Every time he looks at me like that, another piece of me breaks.

I’ve loved him my entire life. And it meant nothing to him.

“Liam, go upstairs,” Ethan grits out. “Your mother and I need to talk.”

Liam glances between us before nodding. “No fighting,” he warns before leaving.

The second he’s gone, Ethan slams his fist onto the counter. “You could’ve sent the damn papers to my office!”

“Ethan—”

“No!” he snarls. “You turned my life upside down nine years ago, and now you do it again? Was this your revenge? Taking my son because I couldn’t love you?”

His words hit like bullets. Each one tearing through me.

“Just get out,” he growls. “I’ll bring Liam home when I’m done.”

I set the papers down, my hands shaking. My phone rings—Mother.

I answer, dread coiling in my stomach.

“Get to the hospital now!” she cries. “Your father’s been shot!”

The phone slips from my fingers.

Ethan’s voice cuts through the haze. “What happened?”

I look up, my heart pounding. “My father’s been shot.”
###Chapter 2

"I have to leave. Can you stay with Liam? I'm not sure how long this will take," I murmur distractedly while grabbing my purse.

"Of course. I'll be there as soon as I can get my mother to watch him," Ethan replies, but his words barely register over the ringing in my ears.

My mind is a fog as I kiss Liam goodbye and step out into the evening. The car door slams shut behind me, and I grip the steering wheel, my thoughts spiraling into the past.

Growing up, I was the invisible child. The afterthought. My father adored Isabella—his golden girl, his perfect princess. My mother doted on Nathan, her precious son. And me? I was just Sophia. The one who never quite fit.

No matter how hard I tried—straight A's, debate team, piano recitals—I was always on the outside looking in. A ghost in my own family.

Then, nine years ago, the fragile threads holding us together snapped entirely. Nathan barely spoke to me after that. My father made his disdain clear with icy silences. My mother only reached out when absolutely necessary. And Isabella? Her last words to me still echo in my nightmares: You're dead to me. I have no sister.

Now, as I drive toward the hospital, my hands are steady. My father's been shot. Shouldn't I feel something? Grief? Panic? Instead, there's just... numbness.

What do you feel when the man who spent a lifetime rejecting you is dying? How are you supposed to react? Is it wrong that my chest is hollow?

The hospital looms ahead, its fluorescent lights too bright against the twilight. I park, take a shuddering breath, and walk inside.

"I'm here for William Sterling. Gunshot victim," I tell the receptionist.

"Relation?"

"His daughter."

She types briskly. "ER. They're prepping him for surgery. Down the hall, through the emergency doors. Your family's already there."

The hallway stretches endlessly. My pulse thrums in my throat.

He'll survive. He has to.

Not for me. For Liam. My son is the only one who ever looked at me like I mattered.

The ER doors swing open. Victoria and Nathan sit hunched on plastic chairs. My mother's sundress is streaked with blood. Nathan's jaw is clenched, his knuckles white.

"Mom. Nathan," I say quietly.

Victoria's face crumples. "They shot him twice—right outside our house. One bullet hit his lung, the other his kidney. They're taking him into surgery now."

I want to touch her. To offer comfort. But my hands stay at my sides.

"He's strong. He'll pull through," I lie.

The gurney rolls out moments later. My father looks frail beneath the hospital lights. Victoria rushes to him, sobbing as he weakly brushes her cheek. Nathan leans in, listening to whispered words I'll never hear.

Then, just before they wheel him away, my father presses something into Victoria's palm. A note? A photograph? Her wail follows him down the hall.

We wait. Hours crawl by. I fetch coffee. Pace. Sit. Stand.

When the surgeon finally appears, his grim expression says everything.

"We did everything we could. I'm sorry."

Victoria's scream is raw, primal. Nathan catches her as she collapses. They sink to the floor together, shattered.

My father is gone.

And with his death comes one certainty: Isabella will return.
###Chapter 3

The plastic hospital chair was cold beneath me as I took slow, measured breaths. Mother—no, Victoria—was still sobbing uncontrollably, her grief a tangible force in the sterile room. My chest ached for her. Losing the man she loved so suddenly was unbearable.

But I was numb.

I had expected William Sterling to pull through. He always did. He was invincible in my mind, despite the years of indifference, the quiet disdain. Now he was gone, and I didn’t know how to mourn a man who had never truly been a father to me.

Yet, I loved him.

Because he was my blood.

"Are you okay?" Ethan’s voice cut through the fog in my mind as he settled beside me.

He had arrived an hour ago, silent until now. The concern in his tone felt foreign. Since when did he care about my feelings?

"Yeah," I muttered.

Not a single tear had fallen since the doctor delivered the news. Maybe shock had frozen me. Or maybe I’d cried all my tears for him years ago. Right now, I was the only one holding myself together while everyone else shattered.

Movement caught my eye. Nathan stood before me, his expression as cold as ever. No warmth. No sympathy. Just the same old resentment.

"What?" I snapped.

"Mom called Isabella when Dad was shot. She’s on her way," he said flatly. "She doesn’t know he’s gone yet."

Ethan’s sharp inhale was all I needed to hear. The fleeting comfort he’d offered moments ago evaporated. Just like that, I lost him again.

"Figured," I mumbled.

I hadn’t spoken to Isabella in years. She’d rather set herself on fire than share air with me.

"I expect you to be civil and give her space," Victoria interjected, wiping her tear-streaked face.

"Mother, you’re asking the impossible."

"I don’t care. You drove my daughter away nine years ago with your betrayal. I won’t let you do it again. Not now, when we need each other most." Her voice was steel.

I hated this. Hated how they kept weaponizing my past. Hadn’t I suffered enough for the mistakes of a foolish girl?

"Am I not your daughter too? Or am I already dead to you?"

I didn’t wait for an answer. I stood and walked out, desperate for air, for escape.

Outside, the cold bit into my lungs. Tears pricked my eyes, but I refused to let them fall. Why was I even here? Why had she called me if I was nothing more than a ghost in this family?

Part of me wanted to leave and never look back.

"Ma’am, are you William Sterling’s daughter?" A nurse startled me.

I nodded, my pulse erratic.

"They’re ready for you to view the body."

"Give me a minute."

She left, and I made my decision.

Despite everything, he had provided for me. I owed him this much. One final goodbye. Then I’d walk away for good.

Inside the morgue, the others had already said their farewells.

William lay still, his face peaceful. Like he was sleeping. Not gone.

"Goodbye, Father."

I turned away before the weight of grief could crush me.

Back in the waiting area, I took the farthest seat. Victoria was buried in paperwork. Nathan stared blankly at the wall. Ethan was gone.

Then the doors burst open.

Isabella.

Long golden hair, legs for days, that perfect heart-shaped face—she hadn’t changed.

Nathan pulled her into a hug, murmuring words I’d never received.

And then Ethan returned.

The moment he saw her, his knees nearly gave out. "Isabella?" His voice cracked.

She turned. Their eyes locked.

And just like that, the world disappeared.

They crashed into each other’s arms.

If Nathan’s embrace had hurt, this was annihilation.

Isabella was back.

And Ethan still loved her.

After all these years.

After me.

The truth was a knife to the heart.
###Chapter 4

Have you ever felt like your heart was being torn apart by invisible hands? That’s exactly how I feel right now, watching them. Every beat is agony, as if my heart has been shattered into a million irreparable pieces.

If I could rip this useless organ from my chest and toss it away, I would. The pain is unbearable, a relentless storm raging inside me.

I want to run. To look away. But I can’t. My eyes are locked on them, as if some cruel force has glued them there, forcing me to witness this intimate moment between Ethan and Isabella.

I watch as they pull apart. Ethan’s expression softens, his gaze filled with adoration as he stares at the woman who has always owned his heart. His hands cradle her face, pulling her closer until their foreheads touch.

He looks at peace. Like he’s finally where he belongs. Like he’s complete.

"I’ve missed you." I see the words form on his lips.

A bitter thought claws at me—what would have happened if they had reunited while we were still married? Would he have betrayed me for her?

Part of me wants to deny it, but deep down, I know the truth. This is Isabella we’re talking about. Ethan would burn the world down for her.

I can’t take it anymore. I stand abruptly and rush outside.

The moment the cold air hits my face, the tears spill over. It hurts. God, it hurts so much I can barely breathe. But who can I blame? I’m the fool who fell in love with a man who was never mine.

"Make it stop," I whisper to the empty sky, pleading with any force that might listen.

No answer comes. No relief.

My chest tightens, my lungs refusing to fill. I claw at my dress, gasping, drowning in the weight of my own grief.

"This is what happens when you chase after someone else’s man." Nathan’s mocking voice cuts through the haze.

I wipe my tears furiously, forcing my mask back into place. "If you’re here to gloat or warn me to stay away from your precious sister, save your breath. Walk your ass back to the hospital. There’s nothing here for you."

His eyebrows shoot up in surprise. Clearly, he didn’t expect me to fight back.

"I just wanted to remind you that Ethan was always Isabella’s. You stole him from her, but now they can finally be together. Don’t interfere."

A hollow laugh escapes me. "Don’t worry. After today, none of you will ever have to see me again."

His frown deepens. "What do you mean?"

I’m too exhausted to explain. All I want is to crawl into bed and forget this nightmare.

"Tell Victoria I’ll help with the funeral arrangements—if she even wants me there. And give Isabella my regards."

Without waiting for a response, I walk away, heading straight for my car. Nathan calls after me, but I don’t look back.

I just need to fall apart in peace.

Three days have passed since William Sterling’s death, and the world still feels off-balance. His loss has left everyone reeling—he was loved by so many.

I haven’t seen Ethan since that day. He’s called, but I ignore every attempt. He’s probably wrapped in Isabella’s arms by now. She might even be living in our home already.

I push the thought away and focus on zipping up my black dress.

"Mommy?" Liam’s small voice breaks through my thoughts.

I turn to find him standing there, tears brimming in his eyes. Kneeling, I pull him close.

"What’s wrong, sweetheart?"

"I miss Grandpa. We were supposed to go fishing this weekend." His voice cracks, and my heart shatters all over again.

William may have failed me as a father, but he adored Liam.

I hug him tightly, whispering against his hair, "I know you miss him. But he’s watching over you now. He’ll always be with you—right here." I press a hand to his chest. "And here." I tap his temple.

"He wouldn’t want you to be sad, okay? Let’s remember all the fun times instead."

Liam nods, sniffling. "Okay."

I wipe his tears and take his hand. "Come on. Let’s go say goodbye properly."

He gives me a small, brave smile, and together, we walk out the door.

It’s time to let go.
###Chapter 5

The day began with no warning of the storm to come. Golden sunlight spilled across the familiar streets as I drove toward the chapel, the world deceptively calm.

The chapel was overflowing when we arrived. Nearly everyone who had known my father had come to say their final goodbyes. My gaze swept the room, ensuring everything was in order. The burden of arrangements had fallen entirely on me—Nathan and Isabella had been useless, as always.

But I didn’t complain. This was my way of repaying him. He had fed me, clothed me, given me shelter when I had nothing.

The service was about to begin. Most attendees had already taken their seats. I chose to sit apart from the others. Sitting beside Isabella felt wrong. Sitting near Ethan felt even worse.

"Mom, why aren’t we sitting with Grandma?" Liam whispered, pointing to where the rest of the family was gathered.

Of course, we were getting stares. But I was used to it. After everything, I was no longer considered part of this family.

"Everyone’s already seated. Let’s not cause a scene," I lied.

He frowned but didn’t argue. The priest arrived, and the service began—just as someone slid into the seat beside me.

I stiffened. I’d recognize his presence anywhere, the faint scent of his cologne wrapping around me like an unwanted embrace. What was he doing here? He should be with her.

"Dad!" Liam whisper-yelled, drawing glances from nearby mourners.

I shot them a glare, and they quickly turned away.

"Can I sit between you two?" Liam asked softly.

Relief washed over me. A small mercy. Now I wouldn’t have to endure Ethan’s suffocating proximity.

I shifted, letting Liam take the middle seat. The moment he did, the tension in my chest eased slightly.

"We all must leave this world one day," the priest intoned. "But how will you be remembered? Will you have changed lives? Or will you depart with regrets?"

The words struck me. If I died today, who would mourn me? Who would care?

No one.

Except Liam.

The thought was crushing. I had no friends—because I never let anyone close. Living in Isabella’s perfect shadow had taught me early that I would never measure up. Not in beauty, not in intelligence, not in love.

Even now, as adults, I was invisible beside her. My pain didn’t matter. My happiness was secondary. She was always the priority.

"Mom?" Liam’s voice pulled me back.

The service had ended. People were rising, murmuring condolences.

"Sophia, are you okay?" Ethan’s deep voice sent an unwanted shiver down my spine.

I didn’t want to look at him. Didn’t want to speak to him. But for the next decade, we’d be tied together through Liam.

I stood without answering, avoiding his gaze. I couldn’t bear to see him—not when the memory of him staring at Isabella with such devotion was still fresh.

"Come on, Liam. Let’s go."

He jumped up, and we moved toward the exit. Outside, a crowd swarmed us with condolences. I spotted colleagues and nodded politely.

We hadn’t even buried my father yet, and I was already exhausted.

"Finally decided to show your face?" Isabella’s voice dripped venom behind me.

I turned. Her eyes were red-rimmed, her face blotchy from crying—yet she still looked like a goddess.

"Not now, Isabella. Let’s just bury Dad first."

She smirked, leaning in so only I could hear. "Oh, we’ll bury him. But know this—I’m taking back everything you stole from me. Including the man who was always meant to be mine."

Then she walked away, just as the priest called us to the gravesite.

Liam glanced between us but stayed silent. Her words shouldn’t have shocked me—but they did.

What she didn’t understand?

None of it had ever been mine to keep.

The family adored her. And Ethan? He had always been hers.

Swallowing the pain, I led Liam to my father’s final resting place. I stood apart from Victoria, Isabella, and Nathan, who clung to each other like a united front. To an outsider, I might as well have been a stranger.

"Ashes to ashes..."

The coffin lowered. Soil rained down. Victoria sobbed, begging for my father to return. Isabella and Nathan held her, silent tears streaking their faces.

I pulled Liam close as he cried. Seeing him like this shattered me. I wiped my own tears away. I had to be strong.

Afterward, another wave of condolences crashed over us. I nodded mechanically, barely present.

"Mom, look—it’s Grandpa and Grandma!" Liam tugged my sleeve, pointing to Ethan’s parents.

They stood with Ethan and Sebastian. I hovered awkwardly as Liam greeted them. Their eyes flicked over me dismissively. I was never their choice for their son.

"Can I get food with them?" Liam asked.

I nodded. He hadn’t eaten in hours.

Once they left, Ethan and I stood in suffocating silence. His attention immediately shifted to Isabella, lingering a few feet away.

I was about to excuse myself when tires screeched.

Gunfire erupted.

Chaos.

Ethan lunged—not for me, but for her, shielding Isabella with his body.

I stood frozen, watching him protect her with his life.

Of course.

Why was I surprised?

I would never be his priority.

"Look out!" A man in a bulletproof vest shoved me aside—but not fast enough.

White-hot pain exploded in my side. I crumpled, gasping. Blood soaked my dress, my vision swimming.

"Call an ambulance!" the stranger barked, pressing hard against the wound.

Dizziness swallowed me.

Liam.

His name was my last thought before darkness took me.
###Chapter 6 

There’s a moment when your entire world shatters—when you see the mother of your child, the woman you once loved, bleeding on the cold cemetery ground. A feeling I never expected to have for Sophia.

When the gunmen appeared, instinct took over. I knew Liam was safe with my parents, so I lunged for Isabella. I’d die for her without hesitation.

The shooters fled at the sight of police, but relief was short-lived. An officer shouted for an ambulance. I turned, expecting one of us to be hurt.

But it was Sophia.

Seeing her like that nearly brought me to my knees.

Chaos followed. The ambulance arrived, and the officer refused to release her until she was in the doctor’s care.

I was furious—at him, at myself. She was my ex-wife, yes, but more importantly, she was Liam’s mother. If something worse had happened… How would I explain that to my son?

Now, I paced the waiting room, restless. No updates. No prognosis. Just silence.

Please let her be okay. Victoria’s whisper was the first time I’d ever heard emotion in her voice when speaking of Sophia. Losing her husband and nearly losing her daughter had cracked her icy exterior.

We were all there—except Liam. Nathan sat beside Victoria, who was next to Isabella.

I dropped into a chair, anxiety gnawing at me. She had to be okay. For Liam.

Time blurred. Then, suddenly, there she was.

Sophia stood at the nurse’s station, signing papers. Her left arm was in a sling as she struggled to tuck her credit card into her bag. She fumbled with her phone, frustration tightening her expression.

"Sophia."

She looked up. Something was different. I couldn’t place it, but it was there—cold, detached.

"What are you doing here? Did someone else get hurt?" Her voice was flat.

"How are you feeling?" Victoria asked instead of answering.

"Unfortunately for you, I’m not dead yet."

The words hit like a slap. Not just the phrasing—the ice in her tone.

"Where are you going?" I cut in.

"Home."

"You can’t drive with that arm."

"Hence the Uber."

"Sophia, we need to talk. About your father," Victoria murmured.

Sophia turned slowly. Something was missing in her eyes.

"I don’t see how that concerns me. Last I checked, he didn’t consider me his daughter."

Victoria choked back a sob, but Sophia didn’t react. It was like she’d shut off all emotion, leaving only bitter detachment.

She moved toward the door, then paused. "Where’s my son?"

"At my mother’s," Nathan answered, watching her closely.

She sighed. "Fine. I suppose you’ll get your talk."

"I’ll drive you," I offered.

Isabella shot me a glare, but she needed to understand—no matter our past, Sophia was Liam’s mother. And she was hurt.

Sophia surprised us all by shaking her head. "No need. I’ll take the Uber and meet you there."

Without another word, she left.

We stared after her. The old Sophia would’ve jumped at any chance to be near me. This rejection was… unsettling.

"Let’s go before she changes her mind," Victoria said quietly.

We piled into my Escalade, speeding to her house just as Sophia stepped inside.

The scene inside was surreal. My parents, Sebastian, and Sophia—who was ignoring them all. Normally, she’d try to engage, even when they dismissed her.

"Can we get this over with?" she snapped, sitting stiffly.

I took a breath. "William came to me with a business proposal. We signed the contracts before realizing the company was a front for a criminal gang. We terminated the deal and reported them."

Sophia arched a brow. "And this involves me… how?"

Victoria took over. "They threatened your father. Then they killed him. We thought the threats were empty until—"

"Until they shot him," Sophia finished flatly.

Nathan growled. "You were shot today. Doesn’t that tell you something?"

"Only that I was in the wrong place at the wrong time."

"Sophia—" Victoria tried.

"No. They were after you three," Sophia cut in. "Everyone knows I’m not part of this family. Why would they target someone none of you would care about if she died?"

The room went cold.

This wasn’t the Sophia we knew.

She turned to me, her gaze empty. "If anyone’s safety matters, it’s hers." She jerked her chin at Isabella. "She was his perfect princess. Leave me out of his mess."

Then, to all of us: "Drop the fake concern. I don’t need it. If I’m in danger, I’ll handle it myself. I’d rather die than accept your protection."

Victoria gasped. Isabella shot up, glaring. "Stop being a bitch. Everything always has to be about you."

Sophia laughed—hollow, humorless. "Nothing’s ever been about me. It’s always you. But fine. I’ve survived without this family’s protection. I don’t need it now."

She turned to leave.

"Liam!"

Seconds later, my son barreled into the room. His gasp at seeing Sophia’s sling twisted my gut.

"Mommy! What happened?"

"Just a little accident, sweetheart," she murmured, hugging him with one arm. The coldness melted instantly.

"Does it hurt?"

"A little. But we’ll fix it with ice cream and cuddles, okay?"

Liam beamed. "I’ll take care of you! Like you do for me!"

Sophia smiled—truly smiled—and the transformation was staggering.

Then Liam glanced at Isabella. "Is that your sister?"

Sophia’s voice turned to steel. "No. I don’t have a sister." Then, under her breath: "Or a family."

The words hung in the air.

"Bye, Dad!" Liam waved.

"Bye, kiddo," I managed.

And then they were gone.

Silence.

I stared at the door, grappling with what just happened. This wasn’t the Sophia I knew.

And I hated it.
###Chapter 7

I woke with a stiff back and a throbbing arm. Liam was still asleep beside me, having refused to leave after we finished watching TV last night. A small smile tugged at my lips as I remembered his words—I take my job seriously, and I’m not leaving you alone tonight.

Carefully, I shifted him aside without waking him. The clock read eight, and I needed to make breakfast before he stirred.

After my morning routine, I headed downstairs, pausing outside the kitchen. How was I supposed to cook with one arm?

As I gathered ingredients for pancakes, yesterday’s events flooded my mind. It all felt surreal—like a nightmare I couldn’t shake. If not for the bandage on my shoulder and the sling cradling my arm, I might’ve convinced myself none of it happened.

Waking up in the hospital had been terrifying. The doctor and nurse had to calm me down, assuring me I was okay. The bullet had lodged in my shoulder, but miraculously, it hadn’t caused serious damage. A little lower, and it would’ve hit your heart, they’d said.

They’d removed the bullet, stitched me up, and sent me home with antibiotics and painkillers. Keep your arm elevated, they’d instructed.

Flipping pancakes, my thoughts drifted to the man who’d saved me. I needed to find him—to thank him. He’d been the only one who cared when my own family hadn’t.

A knock at the door snapped me from my thoughts. Who could it be? After yesterday, I wasn’t eager to see anyone.

I opened the door—and froze.

Standing on my doorstep was the man from the funeral. The first thing I noticed were his eyes—blue. The deepest, clearest blue I’d ever seen.

Yesterday, I’d been too shocked to notice, but now, I couldn’t look away. He was tall—at least six feet—with a strong jaw, tousled dark hair, and an effortless confidence that demanded attention.

"Hey," I croaked, my voice rough.

He smiled—God, that smile—and my stomach flipped. "Hey. Can I come in?"

"Uh—yeah. Sure." I stepped aside.

He entered, glancing around. "Nice place."

"Thanks," I mumbled. "I made pancakes. Want some?"

He nodded, and I led him to the kitchen. Before I could return to cooking, he stopped me, turning me to face him.

"We haven’t been properly introduced. I’m Daniel." He took my hand, turned it over, and pressed a kiss to my knuckles.

Heat rushed to my cheeks. I wasn’t used to this kind of attention—the kind that made my pulse skip.

"I-I’m Sophia."

"I know, beautiful." He winked before taking a seat at the island.

I laughed awkwardly, unsure how to handle his charm. His presence was overwhelming—masculine, confident, and entirely focused on me.

"So, Daniel—no last name—what were you doing at my father’s funeral?" I set a cup of coffee in front of him, then a plate of pancakes.

He chuckled before taking a bite. "A threat was reported. Given your father’s death was tied to it, the chief wanted extra security in case the same people targeted the family."

"You’re a cop? I know most of the force, but I’ve never seen you."

"New transfer. Been buried in work since I got here a few months ago."

I smiled. "Well, consider me your first friend here. I was actually thinking about how to find you this morning."

"Oh?"

"To thank you. For saving my life. I don’t remember much, but I remember you putting pressure on the wound—yelling for help."

He smirked. "Just doing my job. Though, I won’t complain about having a beautiful woman in my arms—even if she fainted at the sight of blood."

I flushed, laughing to hide my embarrassment. He was a charmer, no doubt—but refreshing. Something I hadn’t had in a long time.

"And what brings you here? How’d you even find my address?"

"I’m a cop, remember? Easy enough. As for why—I wanted to make sure you were okay. Had to give a report yesterday, so I couldn’t stay. Came back to the hospital, but you’d already left. Didn’t think showing up at night was appropriate."

His words struck me. This stranger had shown more care than my own family ever had.

"Thank you," I said softly, emotion tightening my throat.

He studied me for a moment before I quickly changed the subject.

We talked and ate, the conversation flowing effortlessly. It was strange—I felt completely at ease with him, despite barely knowing him.

Forty minutes later, he left. We exchanged numbers, though I doubted he’d actually call. Men like him didn’t chase women like me.

I was washing dishes when another knock came. Liam was still asleep, and I wasn’t in a hurry to wake him.

"Did you forget something?" I asked, opening the door.

My stomach dropped.

It wasn’t Daniel.

It was Ethan.

Seeing him sent a rush of pain through me. The memory of him abandoning me for Isabella left a bitter taste in my mouth.

Yesterday had made one thing clear—I meant nothing to him.

I shoved the hurt down, locking it away with the love I’d once felt for him.

Ethan Blackwood was dead to me.

And I didn’t love dead men.
###Chapter 8

The moment her warmth vanishes hits me like a physical blow. One second, her expression is soft—almost nostalgic—and the next, it’s ice. The shift leaves me hollow.

"What are you doing here?" Sophia’s voice is flat, lifeless, as I step inside.

Like I’m nothing. Like I’m a stranger.

I stare, speechless. Ten years together, and suddenly, I can’t string a coherent thought together. My gaze drops to her sling. That’s why I came—to check on her. And to pick up Liam. It’s my weekend.

Then I remember the man leaving her house. My jaw tightens. That’s who the smile was for.

"What was he doing here?" I demand instead of answering, fighting to keep the irrational fury out of my voice.

Sure, the guy’s a cop. He saved her life. But he’s overstepping. I don’t like him near her.

"None of your business," she snaps.

"It is my business when you’re entertaining men this early with my son in the house." My voice drops. "Did he stay the night? Is that why I saw him leaving?"

The idea tastes like acid. She’s already moving on? Introducing random men to Liam?

She laughs, sharp and humorless. "Oh, the hypocrisy. Do I ask about Isabella? Do I care?"

I glare. "Isabella is different."

"How?" She tilts her head, mocking. "Oh, right. She’s the love of your life."

My teeth grind. She’s trying to provoke me.

"I won’t do anything to hurt Liam," she continues, voice steady. "But I’m single now. I’ll see whoever I want. I won’t be alone forever."

My hands fist at that. Something hot and violent coils in my chest.

She turns away, leaving me in the hallway. I force myself to breathe, then follow the sound of clattering pans.

Her house is nothing like ours. The difference is jarring.

She’s in the kitchen, wiping the counter. When she sees me, her glare could freeze hell.

"I hoped you’d leave. You’re not welcome here."

Every word from her lately is poison.

"It’s my weekend. I came for Liam."

"He’s still asleep. You could’ve honked, like usual."

I sit at the island. She tenses, gripping the dish towel.

"I’ll wait. We need to talk."

Her frown deepens. "We have nothing to talk about. Stick to the custody agreement, and we can pretend the other doesn’t exist."

I exhale sharply. Where’s the woman who never argued?

"Isn’t this what you wanted? Me out of your life?" she challenges.

"I didn’t ask for the divorce," I snap.

Her smile is bitter. "But you wanted it. Now you’re free to be with Isabella."

I never lied to her. She always knew Isabella had my heart.

"What do you want me to say? You knew how I felt."

She slams the towel down. "That didn’t stop you from using me, did it? God, I hate you. I wasted years on you."

Rage burns through me. Yes, we slept together. But I kept my vows.

"I’m not here about the past. I’m here about Liam."

At his name, she stills. She pulls out painkillers, swallowing two.

"How’s the arm?" I ask.

"Cut the act, Ethan. You don’t care."

I nearly explode. "Damn it, Sophia!"

"Say what you came to say or leave."

She tries to walk away. I grab her wrist. She jerks back like I’ve burned her.

"Don’t touch me!"

I raise my hands. This is how it’s going to be? Constant war?

"This childishness is why I always preferred Isabella," I growl.

Her face goes deadly cold. "Get out. Now."

I exhale. "I’m sorry."

She scoffs. "Save it."

We can’t keep fighting. Not for Liam’s sake.

"Your parents and mine are going into witness protection," I say. "Because of the gang case. I want Liam with them."

Her face pales. "Why?"

"Because I helped take them down. They’ve threatened me. And they know Liam is my weakness."

She sneers. "And Isabella, right?"

I ignore her. "Your father’s already dead because of this. I won’t risk Liam."

"Why tell me now?"

"You left before we could explain."

"How long?"

"Until the threat’s gone."

She nods, resigned. "When?"

"Two days."

I see the pain in her eyes. But she’ll do anything to keep him safe.

"Fine. You take him today. I’ll take tomorrow."

"Deal."

She leaves to wake Liam.

And that’s when I realize—the love in her eyes when she looked at me?

It’s gone.

Now, she looks at me the way I used to look at her.

With nothing but hate.
###Chapter 9

Liam tugged at my sleeve, his stormy grey eyes filled with defiance. "I still don’t get why I have to go alone. Why can’t you come with me?"

He’d been sulking ever since I told him about the trip with his grandparents. At first, he’d been thrilled—until he realized neither Ethan nor I would be joining him.

His school had been accommodating, even arranging for his lessons to be sent ahead so he wouldn’t fall behind.

"This is a special trip just for you and your grandparents, sweetheart," I said, ruffling his hair.

After speaking with the chief, I’d made sure they were being sent somewhere warm.

"You’re going to the beach. Isn’t that what you’ve been begging for?" I teased, watching his expression shift.

The word beach worked like magic. His pout vanished instantly.

Liam was obsessed with the ocean. After our last trip to the Maldives, he’d cried for a week when we left, begging us to move there—or at least leave him behind.

The memory made me smile. He brought so much light into my life.

"You’re not lying, right?" he asked, snapping me out of my thoughts.

"Would I ever lie to you?"

"No," he admitted, his frown melting into a grin. "Okay, fine. I’m not mad anymore."

"Why were you mad?"

"Because you wouldn’t come with me. But it’s okay. You can visit later."

I bit my tongue before I could say I wouldn’t be joining him. No need to ruin his mood again.

"Come on, let’s go or we’ll be late," I said, grabbing my purse with my good arm while he snatched up his duffel bag and bolted downstairs.

Just as I was about to order a ride, the doorbell rang. I rushed to answer it before Liam could—he had a bad habit of flinging the door open without checking who was there, no matter how many times I warned him.

I groaned when I saw who stood on the other side.

Of course. The moment I decided to move on from Ethan, he was suddenly everywhere.

"Dad!" Liam barreled past me, launching himself at Ethan.

"Hey, champ," Ethan murmured, pulling him into a tight hug. He inhaled deeply, as he always did—once, he’d told me Liam’s scent calmed him, like how some people found peace in fragrances.

Setting Liam down, Ethan turned to me. Our son darted back to the living room, buzzing with excitement.

"What are you doing here?" I asked—a question I’d been asking far too often lately.

He shrugged. "I’m driving you to the airport." He gestured to my injured arm.

I stared at him. As usual, his expression gave nothing away. He reserved that icy detachment just for me—even his business partners got friendlier looks.

"No need. I already called a car."

Lie. The last thing I wanted was to be trapped in a confined space with him.

"Cancel it," he ordered, his voice sending a chill down my spine.

Sometimes I wondered why I’d ever fallen for him. Cold. Arrogant. A complete jerk—especially to me. I should’ve run the other way the second I felt anything for him.

"Not happening, asshole," I hissed. "I’ll meet you at the airport."

Who did he think he was, barking orders in my house?

He stepped into my space, chest to chest, eyes flashing. "I’m not leaving. Cancel the damn ride and get in my car."

My temper flared. Normally, I’d bite my tongue to avoid provoking him—but not anymore.

"You arrogant bastard," I snapped. "I’m not some damn pet you can order around."

For years, I’d let him dictate everything. For years, I’d swallowed my words, desperate to keep what little we had. And what had it gotten me? Nothing but pain.

"Sophia," he warned.

"Are you guys fighting again?" Liam’s voice cut through the tension.

I turned to find him watching us with sad eyes. Damn it. He shouldn’t have to see this.

"No, sweetheart. We just disagree on something." I shot Ethan a look. "Right?"

Like me, his anger had vanished. We’d both do anything for Liam—even tolerate each other.

"Your mom wanted to take a car since she can’t drive," Ethan said smoothly, flashing a lazy smile. "But I wanted to take you myself."

"Why can’t we just go with Dad?" Liam asked, blinking up at me.

I exhaled sharply. Traitor.

"Fine," I muttered.

The things I did for love.

Liam cheered, grabbing his bag while I snatched up my purse. I gave the room one last check before turning—only to crash into Ethan’s chest.

His arm shot out, steadying me before I could stumble. I jerked away, putting distance between us.

"I told you to wait by the door."

"I don’t take orders," he shot back.

"Let’s just go."

I reached for my bag, but he grabbed it first, then Liam’s suitcase, and strode out without another word.

What the hell had gotten into him? He’d never helped me before.

By the time I locked up, Ethan and Liam were already in the car. Reluctantly, I slid into the passenger seat.

Ten minutes in, the silence was suffocating. Liam was glued to his tablet, oblivious. Another ten, and I was ready to fling myself out of the moving vehicle.

I reached for the radio, but Ethan spoke first.

"How’s the arm?"

His eyes stayed on the road, but he glanced at me briefly.

Why did I find one-handed driving so damn attractive?

"Fine."

"Could you give me more than one word?"

"Why? You’ve never cared what I had to say before. You’d go out of your way to ignore me."

He clenched his jaw but said nothing. He knew I was right.

I turned to the window, praying the drive would end soon.

"Your mother’s been asking about you. Have you spoken to her?"

I groaned. "Since when are you so chatty? Just pretend I don’t exist like usual."

His grip on the wheel tightened. He hated that I wasn’t the meek little wife anymore.

Good.

The rest of the ride passed in silence. An hour later, we arrived at the airport.

"I can’t wait to see the ocean!" Liam bounced excitedly.

"Then let’s not keep you waiting," Ethan said, ruffling his hair.

Liam dragged me toward his grandparents, where several officers waited. I recognized a few.

Noah greeted everyone—I didn’t. No point pretending with people who despised me.

Ethan handed the bags to an officer, then joined Isabella, Tristan, and Sebastian. He hugged them before pulling Isabella close and kissing her forehead.

I ignored it. Refused to let it hurt me.

"Five minutes till departure," the pilot announced.

Everyone stared, waiting for me to grovel like I used to. Instead, I acted like they didn’t exist.

Liam said goodbye to Ethan, Tristan, and Sebastian—but completely ignored Isabella.

"Noah, say goodbye to Isabella," Ethan ordered, irritation creeping into his voice.

"I don’t know her," Liam said bluntly, shrugging.

Before Ethan could argue, Liam barreled into me.

"I’ll miss you, Mommy."

"Me too, sweetheart. I’ll call every day."

The officer led him away.

"Bye, Mommy! See you soon!"

"See you soon."

I watched the plane take off, my heart heavy but certain this was best for him.

The second I stepped outside, my phone rang—Ethan Blackwood flashing on the screen.

I declined, hailed a cab, and turned off my phone.

Time to be alone.
###Chapter 10

A week had passed since Liam left, and I still couldn’t find my footing. This was the longest we’d ever been apart, and I wasn’t ashamed to admit how badly I was handling it.

Liam was my anchor. Without him, I felt untethered—like a ship lost at sea, drifting aimlessly. Every day, I waited eagerly for his calls. Those brief moments, hearing his sweet voice, were the only things keeping me grounded.

I hadn’t heard from Ethan Blackwood since the airport. A part of me still ached for him, but I knew this separation was for the best. There was no future between us. I couldn’t keep loving a man who didn’t love me back.

Life had been eerily quiet lately. Not that anyone bothered to keep me updated. But with no more shootings or deaths, I assumed the criminals had gone underground.

Lost in thought, I suddenly collided with someone, my books scattering across the pavement.

"I’m so sorry! I wasn’t watching where I was going," I blurted, bending down to gather my things.

I had just left work, exhausted, craving nothing more than my bed.

"It’s fine. I wasn’t paying attention either."

That voice. My head snapped up.

Daniel Carter stood before me, dressed in his police uniform—and damn, did he look good. I’d sworn off men, but that didn’t mean I couldn’t look. And there was plenty to admire.

He crouched to help me, flashing a charming smile that made my stomach flip.

"What are you doing here?" I asked.

"We got a tip about drug sales near the school," he said, then raised a brow. "You teach here?"

"Yeah," I admitted, suddenly self-conscious.

Teaching wasn’t the expected career for a billionaire’s ex-wife, but I loved it. My parents had hated the idea, preferring I pursue something "prestigious" like my sister Isabella, the high-powered lawyer, or my brother Nathan, the entrepreneur. Another mark against me in their eyes.

"So, what do you teach?" Daniel asked, genuine interest in his tone.

Ethan had never cared about my work. I doubted he even knew my subject.

"Biology."

"Beauty and brains. I like that," he teased, winking.

Heat rushed to my cheeks. "Uh, thanks," I mumbled, tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear.

Daniel flustered me in a way I wasn’t used to. Men rarely noticed me—not when my sister was a stunning blonde goddess. I was the plain one: brown hair, brown eyes, petite frame. Growing up, boys only talked to me to get closer to Isabella. Eventually, I accepted that I just wasn’t attractive.

"Sorry I haven’t called," Daniel said after a pause. "Work’s been insane."

I forced a smile. "It’s okay. I get it—being an officer is demanding."

And I did understand. I also understood that was just an excuse. He’d never intended to call.

An awkward silence settled between us. His piercing blue eyes searched mine, making me shift uncomfortably.

"Daniel!" Another officer called from across the street.

"Coming!" He turned back to me. "Good seeing you, beautiful. Catch you later?"

"Sure," I muttered.

Then, unexpectedly, he pulled me into a quick hug before walking away. I stood there, stunned.

What just happened?

Shaking off the daze, I headed toward the grocery store. My shoulder still ached, but at least the sling was gone.

As I walked, my mind replayed the encounter. Daniel treated me so differently than Ethan ever had. No one had ever called me beautiful before. No one had ever winked at me.

But I couldn’t let it mean anything. If my own husband hadn’t wanted me, why would a man like Daniel?

Stop being ridiculous, I scolded myself.

He was just being polite. A guy like him could have any woman—why would he pick me?

I pushed the thoughts away and focused on shopping. After grabbing what I needed, I stepped outside, ready to hail a cab.

Then I saw them.

Ethan and Isabella.

Hand in hand, laughing like they hadn’t a care in the world. The sound of Ethan’s deep, rich laughter—something I’d never inspired—cut through me like a knife.

The pain I’d buried surged back, raw and suffocating.

I thought I was over this. I wasn’t.

As if sensing me, Ethan turned. His smile vanished, replaced by a frown.

Of course. I brought him nothing but misery.

For a second, I thought he might cross the street toward me. But that was just wishful thinking.

I quickly ducked into a cab, refusing to look back.

He’d moved on. Effortlessly.

Because he’d never loved me.

It was time I did the same. No matter how long it took, I would find happiness.

Ethan Blackwood was my past.

And it was time to leave him there.
###Chapter 11

"Hey sweetheart, how's your day going?" I ask Liam, balancing the phone between my shoulder and ear as I scrub the kitchen counter.

His voice bursts through the line, loud enough to make me wince. "It's amazing! We had ice cream, and now we're going to the slides! They go straight into the ocean!"

His excitement is infectious. Just hearing him happy makes my chest warm. As long as he's safe and having fun, nothing else matters.

"That's awesome, baby. See? I told you you'd love it."

Abandoning the cleaning, I sink onto the couch. Might as well give him my full attention.

"What about you, Mommy? How's your weekend?"

What could I say? Dull as dishwater. My eight-year-old was living his best life while I was stuck in an empty house. No plans, no friends—just me and the echo of my own thoughts.

My coworkers used to invite me out, but they stopped after I kept declining. Deep down, I knew those invites were just polite gestures. They didn’t actually want me there.

"Uh, it's fine. Just cleaning," I murmur.

He sighs dramatically. "Mom, you need to go have fun too. Don’t stay home alone just because I’m not there."

Why did I suddenly feel like I was being scolded by a child?

"I will, I just need to finish up here first," I lie.

After this, I’d probably just binge a movie and drown in junk food. Or take a nap. Neither option sounded terrible.

"Okay, gotta go! Pa’s calling me!"

"Alright, love. Talk to you tonight."

"Bye! Grandma says hi!"

Liam calls my mother "Grandma" and used to call my father "Grandpa." As for Ethan Blackwood’s parents? Pa and Ma.

"Be careful on the slides," I say, pointedly ignoring the mention of my so-called mother.

He hangs up before catching my evasion. Normally, Liam notices everything—a trait he definitely got from his father. But today, his mind was all about fun.

Smiling, I set my phone down and finish cleaning. Instead of watching a movie, I decide to grade my students' biology essays. So far, they’ve done brilliantly. Not to brag, but I’m a damn good teacher—my subject consistently tops the school’s performance charts.

Just as I’m wrapping up, my phone rings. My pulse stutters when I see Daniel Carter’s name flashing on the screen.

"Hello?" I answer cautiously, half-convinced it’s a misdial.

"Hey, Sophia. You busy?"

Guess not.

"Not really. Why?"

"I heard you weren’t at the shooting range. Thought maybe we could drive over together."

I frown. "Why would I be at a shooting range?"

"Because the rest of your family is there. They were all advised to train and get firearm licenses—just in case."

Well, that was news to me. Not that I cared. If they wanted to play cops and robbers, they could do it without me.

"Can I pick you up?" Daniel cuts in.

I have nothing better to do. Plus, it might be fun. And spending time with Daniel? Not exactly a hardship.

"Sure."

"Great. Be there in ten."

He hangs up, and I bolt to my room to throw on something decent. Flats, jeans, a simple top—done.

Daniel arrives right on time, and we head out.

"So," I ask, turning to him, "what made you become a cop?"

The atmosphere is easy, comfortable. It’s nice—I haven’t felt this relaxed around someone in ages.

"My dad was killed by a cop," he says with a shrug.

I blink. "That… usually doesn’t inspire people to join the force."

"I know. But my dad wasn’t a good man. Or a good father. When the cops gunned him down for selling illegal firearms? I was relieved." His voice hardens. "Watching them take out trash like him—someone who thought he was untouchable—made me want to do the same. Clean up the streets."

There’s more there, unspoken. The way he says "dad" with such disdain tells me the man was worse than bad.

I’ve had students like that—kids with abusive parents. I do what I can for them. Abuse is abuse, whether it’s fists or words.

"And you?" he asks. "Why teaching?"

Normally, I’d deflect. But for some reason, I answer.

"My parents weren’t great. I was neglected. But when I was nine, I had this teacher—Miss Olivia. She was everything I wished my mom could be. Kind, supportive, present. I never forgot her. When I grew up, I wanted to be that for someone else."

"Wow," he murmurs, sounding genuinely impressed.

A comfortable silence settles before he catches me off guard.

"You’re single, right?"

I raise a brow. "Divorced."

He smirks. "Good. That means I can shoot my shot."

I laugh, certain he’s joking. Even if he’s not, the moment he sees Isabella, he’ll forget I exist. Just like every other guy in high school.

We pull up to the shooting range. Daniel introduces me to a few colleagues before we head inside.

And there they are. Ethan Blackwood, Isabella, Tristan, and Sebastian.

Tristan and Sebastian are shooting. Isabella’s seated, and Ethan turns the second we walk in. His expression darkens.

"Who invited you?" he snaps, stepping toward us.

"Not you, obviously."

"I called. You didn’t answer."

"Didn’t try hard enough," I shoot back.

Already, irritation prickles under my skin. I regret coming. Should’ve asked Daniel to reschedule.

Before Ethan can retort, Daniel tugs me away. "C’mon, let’s get you fitted."

I glance back just in time to catch Isabella’s glare. If looks could kill, I’d be six feet under.

I sigh. This is going to be a headache.

I should’ve stayed home.
###Chapter 12

I watch as the cop who saved Sophia leads her away. Something about the way he's holding her hand makes my blood boil. Did he really need to grip her hand like that?

I can't explain why seeing them together irritates me so much, but it does. Whatever's brewing between them doesn't sit right with me.

Soft fingers curl around my clenched fist, snapping me out of my thoughts.

"You okay?" Isabella asks, her voice laced with concern.

I turn to face her, and her beauty grounds me.

She's the one I want. The one I've always wanted. I force myself to focus on her, pushing Sophia from my mind.

I don't want Sophia anymore, so why should I care if another man shows interest in her?

"Yeah, I'm fine," I reply, forcing a smile.

Isabella smiles back, and just like the first time, it captivates me. Transports me back to when we were together.

Minutes later, Sophia returns with the cop—Daniel, I think his name is. She's laughing at something he said, looking relaxed, happy even.

Something tightens in my chest, and the irritation I'd pushed down surges back tenfold. What the hell is wrong with me?

I never cared much for her, so why do I suddenly want to smash Daniel's face in?

"Aren't you going to say hi?" Nathan asks Sophia, setting his gun down and removing his earmuffs.

Sebastian does the same, moving to stand beside me. We're twins, but we look nothing alike. Side by side, no one would guess we were related.

Sophia gives her brother a cold look, all traces of warmth gone.

"No need," she says flatly.

"What do you mean, no need? We're family," Nathan snaps, irritation sharp in his tone.

"Since when?" Sophia's voice is icy. "Last I checked, you only had one sister. Ethan had one love. And Sebastian? He never wanted me as a sister-in-law. Since the woman you all actually wanted is standing right here, I don’t see why I should bother pretending."

Her expression is unreadable, leaving us all shifting uncomfortably. She’s right—we were never kind to her, even when she tried.

"You’re being a bitch," Isabella snaps. "Is it so wrong for your brother to want to talk to you?"

Sophia laughs—a sharp, mocking sound I’ve never heard from her before.

"Thanks for the compliment, Isabella. They all thought I was a bitch anyway, so I figured I might as well live up to their expectations. And honestly? It’s liberating."

Isabella opens her mouth to retort, but Sophia cuts her off.

"Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’d like to get away from all of you before your drama scares Daniel off."

With that, she takes Daniel’s hand and walks away without a backward glance.

Daniel. So that’s his name. I make a mental note to dig into his background. There’s something about him I don’t trust.

They settle into a booth, and Daniel starts explaining what looks like the same safety briefing we got earlier. I force myself to look away.

"What the hell just happened?" Nathan mutters, stunned.

Sebastian smirks. "Sophia finally grew a spine."

He looks amused, which is more than I can say for the rest of us.

"Let’s just finish up and get out of here," Isabella huffs, shooting Sophia a glare before taking my hand and turning me away.

Sebastian and I already have our gun licenses. I was here to support Isabella, and Sebastian tagged along because he hadn’t been shooting in a while and thought it’d be fun.

But I can’t focus.

Damn it. I should be paying attention to Isabella, but my eyes keep drifting back to my ex-wife. No matter how hard I try, I can’t stop watching her—and that bastard.

Every little thing he does grates on me. The way his hands linger on her hips as he adjusts her stance. How close he stands behind her. How his lips brush her ear when he whispers something that makes her laugh.

"Ethan?"

I snap my head toward Sebastian. "What?"

This has never happened before. Sophia has never gotten under my skin like this, and I don’t understand why.

"You’re not okay. What’s going on?" he asks carefully.

"Nothing. Why would you think that?"

Damn it. Why does it look like he’s caressing her? And what the hell is she giggling about?

"You’re glaring at your ex-wife and her hero," he points out.

"He’s not a hero!"

"He is. Or did you forget he saved her? That makes him a hero in her eyes."

Sophia turns to Daniel with a look I’ve never seen her give anyone—soft, warm, affectionate. It makes my stomach twist.

"Shut the hell up, Sebastian," I growl.

He chuckles, clearly enjoying this.

"Get it together. You came here with Isabella, not to obsess over Sophia. She’s the one you want, remember? And she’s noticed you’re distracted."

That snaps me back. I glance at Isabella, who’s sitting with her hands in her lap, head bowed. Shit. Sebastian’s right. Isabella doesn’t deserve this. We’re supposed to be starting over, and here I am, fixated on Sophia—who’s clearly moved on.

I set my gun down and sit beside Isabella.

"I’m sorry. My head’s not in the right place today."

It’s not a lie. For some reason, Sophia’s got me twisted up inside, and I don’t know why.

Isabella takes my hand and kisses my cheek. "I get it. You were married to her for nine years. It’s natural you’d be protective, especially with a stranger around."

I exhale, nodding. She’s right. I’m just looking out for Sophia—she’s Liam’s mother, after all. That’s all this is.

Thirty minutes later, Sophia leaves the range alone—the first time Daniel hasn’t been glued to her side.

I wait a beat before excusing myself and following her into the ladies' room, locking the door behind me.

"What the hell, Ethan?" she hisses, spinning around.

I stalk toward her, my steps measured.

"What the hell was that out there?" I snarl.

"I have no idea what you’re talking about," she says, brows furrowed.

I’m not in the mood for games. "Cut the crap, Sophia. What’s going on between you and that bastard?"

She smirks, but her eyes stay cold. "Oh, that? None of your business. And his name is Daniel, by the way."

"I don’t give a damn what his name is. Answer the question."

She tilts her head, a dangerous glint in her eyes. "The best way to get over someone is to get under someone else. That’s what I’m doing."

Something inside me snaps.

Before I can stop myself, I pin her against the wall, caging her in.

"You’re sleeping with him?" I growl, the thought of another man touching her making me see red.

She glares up at me. "Whether I’m fucking him or not is none of your concern. We’re divorced, remember?"

She’s right. But I can’t stop myself. The need to erase his touch consumes me. My hands find her hips—familiar, right.

Her breath hitches, and for a second, I think she feels it too.

Then she shoves me away.

"What are you doing?" she whispers, tears welling in her eyes. "You can’t do this to me. Isabella’s back. If you want to kiss someone, kiss her. Stop playing games with me."

With that, she slips past me and slams the door behind her.

I drag a hand through my hair, exhaling sharply.

What the hell was that?

I punch the wall where I’d just had her pinned.

Sophia’s right. I finally have Isabella. So why the hell am I sabotaging it by almost kissing her sister?

Isabella is the one I’ve always wanted.

So why can’t I get my unwanted ex-wife out of my head?
###Chapter 13

"So Ethan?" Daniel asks as we drive back home.

After what happened in the bathroom, I couldn’t stand being near Ethan another second. I’d begged Daniel to take me home thirty minutes early.

"He’s my ex-husband," I reply flatly, and silence fills the car.

I still couldn’t believe Ethan had the audacity to corner me like that. As if that wasn’t bad enough, he’d nearly kissed me. Me! He’d never initiated a kiss before—not once in our entire marriage. Shocked didn’t even begin to cover it.

I almost let him. God, I’d wanted it so badly. But then I remembered Isabella. That he’d kissed her, touched her, probably done far more. That thought alone gave me the strength to shove him away. I refused to be his backup option. Not again. He had Isabella now. To him, I was nothing but the mother of his son.

Ethan had never been possessive over me. Not like he was with Isabella back in high school. I used to fantasize about him looking at me with that same intensity. But he never did. Until now.

He was jealous. It was written all over him—the clenched jaw, the white-knuckled grip on his glass, the way his eyes darkened every time Daniel touched me.

I didn’t understand it. Sure, I’d lied, let him think Daniel and I were sleeping together. But that was just to get him off my back. I never expected him to snap like that. Part of me wanted to revel in it—finally, some reaction from him. But the smarter part knew better than to hope.

Ethan didn’t love me. Plain and simple. I wouldn’t delude myself into thinking otherwise.

"I thought he was with Isabella? Your sister, according to the tabloids?" Daniel sounds genuinely confused.

"He is."

"So what’s the deal? He just hops between sisters?"

I flinch. Daniel was new in town. He didn’t know the mess I’d made nine years ago. As much as I liked him, I wasn’t ready to confess how my stupid choices had ruined three lives.

"It’s complicated. I don’t want to talk about it."

Honestly, I didn’t even want to think about it. I’d paid enough for that mistake. Rehashing it only brought pain.

"Okay, I won’t push. But if you ever need to talk, I’m here." His words soften something inside me.

No one had ever said that to me before. I’d always dealt with my problems alone—no safety net, no one to listen. Just me.

"Thank you, Daniel," I murmur, my throat tight.

Soon, we pull up to my house. True to his gentlemanly nature, Daniel walks me to my door.

My nosy neighbor’s curtains twitch.

"I had a great time, even if it was cut short," Daniel says with that easy grin. "Next time, dinner’s on me."

His smile is infectious. For a moment, thoughts of Ethan vanish. Daniel and Ethan were alike in some ways—both oozing confidence.

"You’re awfully sure of yourself," I tease.

"Hopeful, more like. So… is that a yes?"

I nod, already looking forward to it. This time, he meant it. Right?

"Good. See you soon, beautiful." He steps closer, pressing a kiss to my cheek.

Heat floods my face. I’m blushing like a teenager.

"You too, Daniel."

"Go on. I’ll wait until you’re inside."

He nudges me toward the door. I unlock it, step inside, and lock up behind me. Leaning against the door, I listen as his footsteps fade, then his car pulls away.

With nothing else to do, I head to bed, my mind tangled between Ethan and Daniel.

The doorbell yanks me from sleep. I groan, squinting at the clock—7:20 AM.

Sunday. Church day. Not that I was devout, but old habits die hard.

Grumbling, I throw on a robe and storm downstairs, ready to rip into whoever dared disturb me.

I wrench the door open—and freeze.

Isabella.

"What do you want?" I snap, too sleep-deprived for this.

"Stay away from Ethan. He’s mine. I won’t let you steal him again." Her eyes burn with fury.

I laugh hollowly. "You came here at dawn to warn me off? Wrong house, Isabella."

I wasn’t the naive girl she’d left behind. I wouldn’t let her walk over me now.

"Ethan is mine, Sophia! I lost nine years with him because of you. I won’t let you ruin this."

"I don’t want him! Keep him. Just leave me alone."

Couldn’t she see? The only tie between Ethan and me was Liam.

"I saw him watching you yesterday. Saw him follow you to the bathroom."

"And that’s my fault how?"

She looks ready to hit me. Even angry, she’s stunning. How does she do it?

"You’re trying to seduce him."

"We were married, Isabella. I don’t need to seduce him. He’s all yours—my sloppy seconds."

I regret it the second it leaves my mouth. Too harsh.

"He would’ve been my husband if you hadn’t obsessed over him. Now I have to—"

"Enough." I cut her off, guilt twisting my stomach.

She’d never believe how much I regretted it.

"Look at you," she sneers. "A nobody teacher with no money, no status. I’m a lawyer. I’m the perfect wife for a man like Ethan. You never were, and you never will be."

With that, she struts to her Tesla and peels away.

Her words don’t sting. I’d heard it all before—how Ethan and I didn’t fit. But I loved my job. That was enough.

I finish grading papers, then head to church, still rattled from last night and this morning.

The sermon blurs past. As I leave, my phone buzzes.

I answer without looking, digging for my keys.

"What the hell did you say to Isabella?" Ethan’s voice is ice.

Of course she’d run to him, leaving out her unhinged visit.

"Ethan—"

I hit the unlock button.

Then—

A deafening boom.

Heat slams into me, throwing me back.

The world goes black.

The last thing I hear is screaming.
###Chapter 14

My skull feels like it's splitting open. No—scratch that. Every inch of my body screams in agony. I try prying my eyes open, but they refuse. Heavy, like stones are weighing them down. I attempt to call for Liam, for anyone, but my voice betrays me, trapped in my throat.

I'm moving. Or rather, someone is moving me. Each jolt sends fresh waves of pain radiating through me. I silently beg them to slow down. Or better yet, just stop.

"We need a doctor—now!" a voice barks.

I don’t understand. Why a doctor? What’s happening? I fight to stay conscious, but the darkness drags me under again, and this time, I don’t resist.

When awareness returns, the pain has dulled, but my body still won’t obey. My limbs feel encased in concrete. A prisoner inside my own skin.

Voices murmur around me, distant and muffled, as if submerged underwater. Nothing makes sense. Panic claws at me—where’s Liam? He must be frantic since I never called. But I’m powerless to do anything.

The void claims me again before I can grasp my surroundings. My last coherent thought is of Liam’s face, the hurt he’d feel if I never came home.

Light assaults my vision when I finally wake. I flinch, squeezing my eyes shut against the brightness.

"You're awake," a woman’s voice says—soft, unfamiliar.

I try opening my eyes again, but the light is relentless.

"Sorry about that," she murmurs. Fabric rustles. "There. You can look now."

True to her word, the room is dim when I blink my eyes open. Curtains drawn, lights low. A nurse—late thirties, crisp uniform—stands beside me. The sterile scent confirms it: a hospital.

"Thank you," I rasp, my throat raw.

She hands me water. "Drink slowly. I’ll fetch the doctor. Your family will be thrilled you’re awake."

I sip, savoring the cool relief. The room is cluttered with flowers, balloons, and teddy bears. A stack of cards sits on the bedside table. I reach for one just as the door swings open.

Ethan Blackwood strides in.

"You look terrible," I croak, my voice steadier now.

His usually immaculate appearance is wrecked—hair wild, clothes wrinkled, shadows bruising his eyes. I’ve never seen him like this. The Ethan I know is always polished, controlled. Now, he looks like he’s survived a war.

"How do you feel?" he asks, sinking into the chair beside me.

"Like I lost a fight with a freight train." I frown. "Why are you here?"

His hand engulfs mine before I can pull away. His grip tightens when I try.

"Don’t," he whispers, voice frayed. "I need this. To know you’re real. That this isn’t some nightmare."

My confusion deepens. Did I wake up in some twisted parallel universe? None of this adds up.

"Ethan, are you okay? Did you hit your head or something?" I press my free hand to his forehead.

The door interrupts us. A doctor enters, scanning a chart before smiling at me.

"Miss Sterling, glad you’re awake. We were worried." He flips a page. "Do you know where you are? What happened?"

I nod. "Hospital. Someone—something—shoved me when I unlocked my car. I hit my head."

I’ve avoided dwelling on it since waking. Terrified to acknowledge how close I came to dying.

"Correct. Your car was bombed. The blast threw you back." He pauses. "And what year is it?"

I answer. He scribbles notes. Ethan’s hand tightens around mine. When I glance at him, something flickers in his gaze—gone before I can decipher it.

Bombed. The word echoes in my skull. A headache builds, pain seeping into my bones.



"Remembering the year, your name, and recognizing Mr. Blackwood are excellent signs. We’ll run more tests to rule out amnesia."

"Okay," I whisper.

"Now, your injuries: dislocated shoulder—repaired. Three broken ribs. Ruptured spleen. Traumatic brain injury causing fluid buildup—we drained it. Reopened shoulder stitches—repaired. The head injury remains our primary concern. Any questions?"

My free hand drifts to the bandages. The reality sinks in.

"How long have I been here?"

"Four days. We induced a coma to reduce swelling. We’ll monitor you longer for complications."

I nod, exhaustion pulling at me.

The doctor smiles. "I’ll give you and your husband privacy."

Husband? I arch a brow at Ethan as the door shuts.

He has the decency to look sheepish. "They wouldn’t let me see you otherwise."

"Liam—is he okay? Please tell him nothing." My voice cracks. The thought of him grieving wrecks me.

"Hey." Ethan thumbs away my tears. "You’re alive. Liam’s fine. He misses you."

"You’re being weird," I laugh weakly.

This is the Ethan I once loved. But I know it’s temporary. Once I’m healed, he’ll revert to cold indifference. The thought aches.

My eyelids droop. I fight it, but my body demands surrender.

"Sleep, Sophia," Ethan murmurs. Lips brush my forehead. "I’m not going anywhere."

I must be dreaming. Because the real Ethan Blackwood would never be this tender.


###Chapter 15

"How is she doing, Ethan?" Victoria, Sophia's mother, asks.

Her voice trembles with genuine worry. I can hear the effort she’s making to hold back tears. The past few days have been hell, and I still can’t shake the image of Sophia lying lifeless in that wreckage.

"She woke up briefly yesterday before falling back asleep. The doctors say it’s normal for head trauma patients," I reassure her.

A relieved sigh escapes her lips. Victoria hasn’t been the same since William’s death. She’s been trying to mend things with Sophia, but now, Sophia wants nothing to do with her—or any of us.

"Will she recover fully?"

"The doctors are optimistic, but they can’t guarantee there won’t be complications."

That’s what terrifies me the most. All I want is for her to be okay.

"Don’t worry. Sophia’s strong. She’ll pull through. I’ll call when she wakes up again. Last time, she asked about Liam."

"Please keep me updated, Ethan. Make sure she gets the best care."

"I will."

I hang up and turn back to her. She looks peaceful, almost ethereal. How had I never noticed the delicate curve of her cheekbones, the way her dark lashes fan against her skin, or the soft pout of her lips?

Because you never let yourself see her. You were too busy resenting her.

The truth stings. I’d spent years shutting her out, refusing to acknowledge anything about her—until now. This version of Sophia demands to be seen.

I take her hand in mine, small and warm. I’ve been doing this a lot—tracing the pulse at her wrist, reminding myself she’s still here. That the explosion didn’t take her from us.

The memory of that Sunday still claws at my chest. I’d called her, furious, after Isabella came to me in tears, claiming Sophia had lashed out at her. Then—the deafening blast, the screams. My voice, raw with panic, shouting her name into the phone.

When the call came that her car had been bombed, something inside me shattered. It wasn’t just fear. It was something deeper, something I couldn’t name.

A knock pulls me from the memory.

Nathan and Isabella step in. Nathan looks wrecked—dark circles under his eyes, his usual polished demeanor gone. Even Isabella’s usual confidence is frayed.

"Has she woken up?" Nathan asks quietly.

The attack had shaken everyone. Nearly losing his sister had stripped him of his usual arrogance.

"No," I answer.

"You need to go home, Ethan," Isabella insists. "Shower. Change. You look like death."

"I’m not leaving her."

The thought of something happening while I’m gone makes my stomach twist.

"You’re no use to anyone like this," she argues. "Just go. We won’t leave her side."

Nathan nods. "I promise."

I glance at Sophia. Still asleep. No signs of waking soon. Maybe a quick shower wouldn’t hurt.

"Fine. But don’t let anyone near her."

If someone had targeted her once, they might try again.

Nathan’s gaze stays fixed on Sophia. Isabella studies me, her piercing blue eyes searching for something.

As I stand to leave, she catches my arm.

"She’ll be okay," she murmurs, pressing a kiss to my lips.

It’s the first time since we decided to try again that she’s kissed me like this. I’ve waited years for this moment—so why does it feel wrong?

Her lips don’t fit. The warmth isn’t there.

Shaking off the thought, I head home, shower in record time, and collapse onto the bed for what I swear will be a thirty-minute nap.

Three hours later, I bolt upright.

Shit.

A text from Nathan lights up my phone: She’s awake.

I’m out the door in seconds, breaking every speed limit to get back to the hospital.

When I arrive, Nathan and Isabella are sitting outside her room.

"I told you not to leave her," I snap.

"She kicked us out," Isabella says flatly.

"What?"

Sophia wouldn’t do that. Not even now.

"Exactly what I said. She told the nurse she didn’t want us there." Nathan’s voice is tight, masking something raw.

Then I hear it—her laugh, followed by a pained groan.

"Who’s with her?"

Isabella’s eyes lock onto mine. "Daniel. He showed up right after we were asked to leave."

My jaw clenches. That bastard.

Without another word, I shove the door open.

Daniel sits at her bedside, flipping through a stack of cards. Sophia is propped up slightly, bandages covering her temple, scratches marring her face—but she’s smiling.

Until she sees me.

"Get out," she orders, her voice icy.

"Not happening." I take the seat on her left.

Her glare could melt steel. What the hell happened between yesterday and now?

"I don’t want you here. Take them with you—I don’t need any of you."

She means Nathan and Isabella. Something must have gone down while I was gone.

"You need to calm down," Daniel cuts in, squeezing her hand.

The way she looks at him—soft, trusting—sends a surge of fury through me. Why does it bother me so much? I should be relieved she’s moved on.

Before I can dwell on it, the door opens.

Chief Harrison steps in.

Daniel releases her hand and stands. "Chief."

"Good to see you, Daniel." He claps him on the back before turning to us. "Miss Sterling, I need to ask you a few questions."

Sophia nods.

"Do you remember anything unusual before the attack?"

She frowns. "No. It was a normal day—breakfast, then church."

"What about the day before? Any strangers?"

She shakes her head, wincing as she adjusts.

"Do you have enemies? Someone who’d want you dead?"

"I keep to myself. I can’t think of anyone."

"You didn’t answer. Do you have enemies?"

Her fingers press to her temples. "People don’t like me. My family, for starters. But I doubt they’d go this far."

The chief scribbles something down. Something about his questions feels off.

"The bomb was planted while you were in church, triggered when you unlocked your car. Did you hear anything strange?"

"No. I was... distracted."

Guilt twists in my gut. Because of me. Because I’d called to scream at her.

"Why are you asking this?" I interject. "I thought this was tied to the gang shootings."

"Initially, yes. But after Sunday, we believe Miss Sterling was specifically targeted. We just don’t know by whom."

The room falls silent.

Someone wants her dead.

And I have no idea who.
###Chapter 16

"Mommy, I missed you so much. Why didn't you call?" Liam's voice trembled with sadness.

My heart ached to hold him, to reassure myself that I was still here for him—that I wouldn't leave him motherless.

"I'm sorry, sweetheart. I lost my phone and had to borrow your dad's."

"Can we video call? I need to see you," he demanded.

I knew he sensed something was wrong, but I couldn’t let him see me in a hospital bed. If he panicked, he’d beg to come home. And with someone possibly targeting me, I couldn’t risk putting him in danger.

The idea that I might be a target still felt surreal. Who would want me dead?

"Not right now, baby. They don’t allow video calls here," I lied.

"That’s a dumb rule! Who makes rules like that?" His frustration crackled through the phone.

I let it slide. He was upset, and I understood.

"Liam—"

"I just want to see you, Mommy. Can’t Dad make them let you? He can do anything!" His voice wobbled, close to tears, shattering my heart.

I glanced at Ethan, who smirked like an idiot. Liam knew exactly how his father operated—one word from Ethan Blackwood, and the world bent to his will.

"Not this time. How about I call you tomorrow, and we’ll Skype?"

"You promise?"

"I promise."

I was being discharged today, giving me time to prepare for the call.

"Okay, Mommy. Talk to you tomorrow. I love you."

"Bye, baby. Love you too."

"Grandma wants to—"

I hung up before he could finish. Guilt gnawed at me, but I couldn’t face her right now.



Ethan stared at me, one brow arched, an unreadable expression flickering across his face. I’d begged him to leave, even asked the nurse to kick him out—but he’d threatened to shut down the entire hospital.

Now, my unwelcome shadow was here every day. His constant presence suffocated me, especially after waking up to find Isabella and Nathan in my room. Nathan had left to grab food, and the moment he did, Isabella pounced like a starving predator.

Three Days Ago

"Your little stunt won’t work, Sophia," Isabella sneered the second Nathan was gone.

"What the hell are you talking about?"

I wasn’t in the mood for her drama. She was determined to pick a fight, and I was too weak to play her games.

"This 'accident'—I bet you planned it to get Ethan’s attention. But I won’t let you near him."

I laughed, then winced as pain shot through my ribs.

"Let me get this straight. You think I blew up my own car to land in the hospital… just to get Ethan’s attention?"

She was delusional. Everyone thought I was the dim one in the family—they should hear their precious Isabella spouting nonsense.

"Of course. Who’d want to kill you? What’s the point? Ethan doesn’t love you. He wouldn’t care if you lived or died. None of us would. You’re nothing." Her scornful gaze raked over me.

I’d never wanted to hit someone so badly.

"So you came here to insult me? Kick me while I’m down?"

Why was she even here? Who let her in? I wanted her gone before she did something worse.

"I’m just stating facts. I hope that gang doesn’t kill you first—I want you to watch as I take everything from you. Including your son. Soon, he’ll call me Mom."

How were we even related? Yes, I’d wronged her—but hadn’t I suffered enough?



"You’re vile, Isabella. But remember—Liam will never see you as his mother. Recall how he ignored you at the airport? You’re nothing to him. You always will be."

Her triumphant smirk twisted into rage.

"Fine. At least it’s my name Ethan screams at night. I’ll make sure he fills me with his cum until I’m pregnant. Once I am, he’ll forget about you and that brat. His only children will be mine. Face it—he’s never loved you. Every time he touched you, he was imagining me. How often did he moan my name in bed?"

I tuned her out, though her words stung. My only concern was Liam. But when she called him a brat, I saw red. Grabbing the nearest vase, I hurled it at her head. She ducked with a shriek, and it shattered against the wall just as Nathan walked in.

"Are you insane?!" Isabella screeched.

"Get out! Both of you!" I screamed back.

The nurse rushed in, eyes wide.

"Sophia, what’s wrong?" Nathan asked gently, but I didn’t want his fake concern.

Not after years of him treating me like garbage, rubbing his love for Isabella in my face while acting like I was nothing.

"Ask your darling sister," I spat, glaring at them before turning to the nurse. "Make them leave. Now."

My head throbbed, the heart monitor beeping erratically.

The nurse squared her shoulders. "You need to go. You’re stressing her."

"She’s my sister! You can’t kick me out!" Nathan growled.

I scoffed. Since when?

"Security will escort you if you refuse," the nurse snapped, all politeness gone.

"Sophia, please," Nathan begged.

But I had nothing left to give. They’d taken everything and thrown it back in my face.

"Leave, Nathan. And keep your sister away from me."



I turned away, shutting my eyes until they were gone. After a heated argument with the nurse, they finally left—only for Daniel to arrive and make me laugh for the first time in days.

Present

"What did you say?" Ethan’s voice snapped me back to reality.

"I asked if you’re ready to leave," he repeated.

I studied him, wondering if Isabella was right. Would Ethan really abandon Liam? I wanted to believe he wouldn’t—but I wasn’t sure. Isabella meant everything to him. Did that outweigh our son?

"Why are you here, Ethan?" I asked instead.

He frowned. "What do you mean?"

"We both know I’m your least favorite person. Shouldn’t you be with Isabella, enjoying your reunion?" Bitterness laced my words, her taunts still echoing in my mind.

He sighed. "You’re looking for a fight. Let’s just get you home."

"I don’t need help from a man who hates me! Leave, Ethan. You’d rather be anywhere else."

"Really? Who’ll help you check out? You have no one, Sophia."

"Daniel. He’ll take me home." It was true—I had no friends. But Daniel would come if I asked.

Ethan’s face hardened, fists clenching. "Over my dead body. You have two choices: I take you home, or you stay here longer. Either way, he isn’t touching you."

"Seriously, Ethan? You couldn’t wait to be rid of me—now you’re glued to me like a bad rash. I don’t want drama with Isabella. I just want peace."

He needed to back off. I refused to be accused of using this mess to seduce him.

"Speaking of, what happened between you and Isabella the day you were attacked?"

"I’m sure she’s already told you." Lies, I added silently.

"I want your side."

Slowly, I slid off the bed and shuffled to the bathroom. "No point. You’ll believe her, like always."

"Sophia—" I shut the door before he could finish.

Dressing drained me. By the time I finished, I was breathless, vision blurring. Leaning on the wall for support, I shrugged off Ethan’s offered hand and collapsed into the wheelchair.

"Let’s go. The sooner we leave, the sooner we’re apart." Exhaustion dragged at me.

He sighed but wheeled me out. The discharge process blurred together. My eyelids grew heavy—then everything went black.

I woke in Ethan’s arms as he carried me up a familiar staircase.

"What are you doing?" I mumbled.

"Putting you to bed. You passed out before we reached the car."

His warmth, his deep voice—I nuzzled closer without thinking. He chuckled, but I didn’t care. He smelled divine, his body solid and safe. My eyes fluttered shut as I drifted, weightless.

He laid me on something soft, then joined me. I turned, resting my head on his chest as his arms curled around my waist, pulling me close.

As sleep claimed me, one thought lingered: This feels right. In this dream, Ethan didn’t push me away. In this dream, I was exactly where I’d always wanted to be.
###Chapter 17

My eyes flutter open to an empty bed. A heavy sigh escapes my lips. Of course it was just a dream. There was no way Ethan Blackwood would actually be here with me. The last thing I remember is passing out at the hospital. Those pain meds must have been stronger than I thought, conjuring up fantasies that never happened.

I push myself up slowly, but the room tilts violently. My hands grip the sheets as I wait for the dizziness to pass. When it finally does, I shuffle to the bathroom like a newborn fawn, desperate to wash the sterile hospital scent from my skin.

My to-do list looms over me. No phone. No car. The police said my phone shattered on impact. School gave me a few weeks' leave, but I need wheels before I can return.

Dressing feels like climbing a mountain. By the time I'm done, my head throbs like a drum.

"Damn it. Need my meds," I mutter.

Each step downstairs is a battle. My limbs feel like wet noodles. The kitchen seems miles away. I manage to throw together something resembling breakfast, though it tastes like cardboard. The pills go down easier than the food.

Just as I collapse onto the couch, the doorbell rings.

I groan. Whoever's there can come back in a decade.

It rings again. And again.

"Fine!" I snap, hauling myself up. My legs wobble dangerously as I yank the door open.

A stunning woman stands on my porch. Raven hair. Emerald eyes. Lips like rose petals.

"Can I help you?" I lean against the doorframe, praying my knees don't buckle.

Tears glisten in her eyes as she does the unthinkable—she hugs me. I freeze.

"I was afraid you'd still be asleep," she says, pulling back.

"Who the hell are you?"

She smacks her forehead. "Shit. Introductions first. My bad."

Against my will, I smile. There's something oddly charming about her.

"Can we go inside?" she asks.

"I don't know you. Not exactly inviting stranger danger in."

She blinks. "After what happened, I get the skepticism. But I promise I'm not here to murder you."

Something in her gaze makes me hesitate. Against all logic, I step aside.

"One wrong move and I'll gut you before my afternoon nap," I warn.

She grins. "I like you already. Need help walking?"

My glare answers for me.

We settle in the living room, me collapsing onto the couch like a sack of potatoes.

"Who are you and why are you here?"

"Amelia. But call me Letty. I'm your brother's girlfriend."

Ice floods my veins. "Get out."

"Please, just hear me out."

Against my better judgment, I do.

There's something about her—an ease I can't explain. She could be a serial killer, yet I feel safe.

"I know what Tristan did was awful," she says. "I love him, but I'm not blind to his faults. What he did to you...no one deserves that."

She wrings her hands. "I've wanted to meet you for ages. When I heard what happened, I had to come. Give me a chance?"

I curl my legs beneath me. "Does he know you're here?"

"We don't keep secrets. But he doesn't control me."

The love in her voice is undeniable. Tristan might be a saint to others, but to me? He's the villain in every story.

Yet...something stops me from shutting her out. Maybe it's the drugs. Maybe it's loneliness.

"One condition," I say finally. "Never mention Tristan or his family to me. Ever."

I watch the conflict play across her face. The hesitation. Finally, she nods.

"Deal." She extends a hand. "Friends?"

I take it reluctantly. "Friends."

The word feels foreign. Dangerous. But after surviving death, what's one more risk?

We talk for hours. She's a secretary at William Sterling's company. Only a year older than me. An orphan raised by her grandmother.

It's...nice. Weird, but nice.

"—and then I realized I'd been wearing two different shoes the entire time!" she's mid-story when the door knocks.

"Can you get that?" I plead. "I might faceplant on the way."

She returns with a redhead carrying a duffel bag.

"Miss Sterling," the stranger greets.

"Who the hell are you now?" I snap.

Letty looks amused. "Apparently, she's your nurse."

My blood runs cold. I didn't hire any nurse.

So who sent her?
###Chapter 18

"My name is Charlotte, Miss Sterling," the nurse says, her polite smile unwavering.

I study her, my gaze sharp and assessing. Beside me, Amelia does the same.

"I never hired a nurse," I tell them both. "I’d say you have the wrong house, but you clearly know my name. So either someone else hired you, or this is some kind of trick."

Don’t get me wrong—having a nurse to help me recover would be a relief. But this? This was suspicious.

Charlotte sets her bag down and faces me squarely. "I was hired by Mr. Blackwood. He instructed me to report here immediately."

A groan of frustration escapes me. Surprise and irritation war inside me. Of course Ethan would pull something like this. The moment I decide I don’t need his help, he swoops in like some kind of savior. Where was this concern during our marriage when I actually needed him?

"You wasted your time coming here," I say, leaning back against the sofa. "You need to leave."

I wouldn’t accept anything from Ethan. The only connection we had left was Liam. That was it. I didn’t want him in my life in any other way. I’d been taking care of myself since I was old enough to remember—I didn’t need his charity now.

"I’m sorry, madam, but he was very clear—I’m not to leave, no matter how stubborn you get."

Her tone grates on my nerves. She speaks to me like I’m some unruly child. My patience snaps.

"Listen, this is my damn house, and Ethan has no say here. Leave before I call the police."

Uncertainty flickers across her face. She wants to obey Ethan’s orders, but she’s not sure I won’t follow through on my threat.

Before she can respond, another knock echoes through the house. Seriously? Was today Invade Sophia’s House day?

"Looks like you have another visitor," Amelia says dryly before heading to the door.

She returns with a uniformed man holding a clipboard.

"Sophia Sterling?" he asks.

I raise my hand weakly.

"I have a delivery for you. I’ll need your signature."

"What delivery?" I rub my temples, already feeling a migraine coming on. I was tempted to kick everyone out just to get some peace.

He checks his clipboard. "A brand-new Range Rover."

I blink. "Excuse me?"

Amelia bolts out of the room before I can process his words.

The man repeats himself, unfazed. I stare at him, dumbfounded. First a nurse I didn’t hire, now a car?

"Damn, it’s the latest model," Amelia says, walking back in, looking stunned.

I turn back to the delivery man. "Let me guess—Ethan Blackwood bought it and put it in my name?"

Before he can answer, the man himself strides in like he owns the place.

"Actually, yes. Your car was destroyed, so I got you a new one." He nods at Amelia. "Hello, Amelia."

She greets him back, leaving me gaping at them. Apparently, I was the only one who didn’t know my brother was dating her. Would I have ever found out if she hadn’t come here herself?

I stand slowly, facing Ethan. "I appreciate the gesture—since I’m Liam’s mother—but it’s unnecessary. I have everything under control."

Deep down, I knew that was the only reason he was doing this. Not because he cared, but because I was Liam’s mother. He’d made that painfully clear before.

A frown darkens his face. "That’s not why."

"I don’t need your help," I interrupt. "Tell him to take the car back, and terminate her services." I gesture at the delivery man and Charlotte.

"You don’t need help?" Ethan scoffs. "I don’t see a new car. No phone. And you look like you’re about to collapse. You need rest and someone to take care of you."

"I said I’m fine. I’ll order a new phone tomorrow, and I already have a plan for a car."

Why couldn’t he just leave me alone? Ignore me like he used to?

"Then show me. Show me the car you’ve picked out," he demands, his tone domineering.

I huff, grabbing my laptop. I’d done my research in the hospital. I knew exactly what I wanted.

I turn the screen toward him.

"Seriously?" He raises an eyebrow, disdain dripping from his voice.

"That’s a piece of junk, Sophia," Amelia chimes in.

I turn to find everyone peering over my shoulder, nodding in agreement. Irritation flares—I’d forgotten we had an audience.

"Excuse us," I mutter, grabbing Ethan’s wrist and dragging him to the kitchen.

In my head, it was a swift, dramatic move. In reality, it was slow and awkward.

I release him, leaning against the counter.

"Amelia’s right. That car is garbage," he sneers. "How are you even supposed to drive it?"

Sure, it was old and used—probably falling apart—but it was my choice. It didn’t need to be flashy. Just functional.

"It’s my decision, Ethan," I snap, crossing my arms.

His expression shifts into that cold, businesslike mask I knew too well.

"You refused a single penny in the divorce. On a teacher’s salary, you can’t afford much. This house is mortgaged, bills pile up, and now you want to add a car payment? Just accept my help. It’s practical."

Every word stings because it echoes what Isabella and everyone else thinks of me. They look down on me for being just a teacher.

"I said no to the damn car!" I shout, my temper flaring.

His jaw tightens, and he steps into my space. "Be reasonable for once in your life, Sophia."

"I am being reasonable! I asked for a divorce so you’d be out of my life. Why are you suddenly so invested in helping me when you couldn’t care less before?"

"Because you’re Liam’s mother," he growls, eyes blazing. "Our lives are tied together whether you like it or not."

"Only for the next ten years. Being in Liam’s life doesn’t mean you have to be in mine."

Exhaustion weighs me down. I slump onto a barstool, my head throbbing.

"Take the damn car," he orders again.

"Why don’t you take it and shove it where the sun doesn’t shine?" I snap.

It wasn’t about gratitude. I just didn’t want to owe him anything. And I definitely didn’t need Isabella showing up to lecture me about it.

Before Ethan can retort, Amelia walks in.

"Not sure why you two bothered leaving the room when we can hear you screaming from here."

We both glare at her.

"Look, Ethan, Sophia’s exhausted. It’s been a long morning. Drop the car argument—you’re just making it worse. And Sophia, accept Charlotte’s help. You can barely stand. You need someone."

I want to argue, but she’s right. I do need help. Maybe just this once…

"Fine," Ethan and I say in unison.

Amelia smirks, helping me up. "You’re about to pass out."

She guides me back to the living room. The delivery man is gone—probably waiting outside.

Amelia hands me off to Charlotte. "Looks like you’re staying. Ethan and I will head out."

Charlotte nods. Amelia steps forward, hugging me tightly.

"I’ll see you soon. And thank you… for giving me a chance." Her voice is thick with emotion.

All I can manage is a weak smile.

She hugs me once more before leaving. I expect Ethan to follow, but he lingers.

"One more thing." He places a brand-new phone on the table.

Before I can react, he brushes a soft kiss against my cheek—then walks away.

I stand there, stunned.

"Come, Miss Sterling. Let’s get you to bed," Charlotte murmurs.

I nod absently, my mind racing.

Why was Ethan doing this? I didn’t want this softer side of him—the one he’d never shown me before. It was easier when he was just the villain in my story.

Easier to hate him.
###Chapter 19

I adjust my hoodie, trying to look somewhat put together instead of like I just survived a battle with death itself.

"Why are you wearing a beanie, Mommy?" Liam eyes me suspiciously through the screen.

We were finally Skyping after I'd postponed our calls multiple times. Mostly because I could barely keep my eyes open for more than five minutes. Today, though, I felt slightly better.

I lean back against my headboard. The beanie hides the bandage. Liam still doesn’t know what happened to me, and I intend to keep it that way.

"It's a little chilly in here," I lie.

Guilt gnaws at me, but I know it's necessary. There's no reason to worry him.

"We have a heater, Mom. You could just turn it on."

"It's broken, and I forgot to call someone to fix it."

Damn it. I hate lying to him. Part of me feels like a terrible mother—like all I’ve done since his father died is deceive him. The other part knows it’s for his own good.

"Okay…" he mumbles, clearly not convinced.

"So, what did you do today?" I ask, changing the subject.

Even the smallest details of his life excite me. His happiness is mine, and I’ll protect it at all costs.

The frown on his face vanishes, replaced by a bright grin.

"I saw dolphins today! I even swam with them. It was so fun!" His excitement is contagious.

"I wish I could’ve been there with you."

"Don’t worry, Mommy. Grandma recorded it. She said she’ll send you the video."

I nod. I’d reluctantly accepted the new phone Ethan had gotten me. Turns out, he didn’t just replace the phone—he even transferred my SIM card.

I’ve been avoiding Ethan as much as possible. He calls occasionally to check on me, but I keep those conversations short and impersonal. I want peace, and Ethan’s involvement in my life guarantees anything but. Especially with Isabella in the picture.

"Mommy, why was Isabella at Dad’s house?" His question yanks me back to reality.

"What do you mean?"

"I Skyped Dad yesterday, and she was there, sitting really close to him, holding his hand… I didn’t like it." His frown returns, so much like his father’s.

The words sting more than I want to admit. Knowing Ethan is already playing house with her brings back the pain I’ve tried so hard to bury.

Why do we convince ourselves we’ve moved on, only for one trigger to shatter that illusion?

"I don’t know, sweetheart. You’ll have to ask your dad." My voice wavers, and I hate how affected I sound.

I won’t explain this to Liam. If Ethan wants to flaunt his relationship with Isabella in front of our son, then he can be the one to answer the hard questions.

"I want you and Dad to get back together. So we can be a family again." His sadness cracks my already fragile heart.

"Liam, your father and I are just too different to make it work."

We’d pretended for his sake—acted like we loved each other, like we were okay. But it was all a lie. Ethan could barely stand me, though Liam never noticed.

Looking back, I wish I’d refused when Ethan proposed after I got pregnant. I was naïve, thinking I could make him love me. That one day, he’d feel for me what I felt for him.

But he never did.

His heart belonged to Isabella. Even when we were intimate, it meant nothing to him. It was just biology. For me, it was love. For him, it was just sex. And he was always careful—never risking another "mistake."

"Don’t you love him?" Liam asks, the same question he’d demanded of Ethan weeks ago.

I want to lie, but I’ve done enough of that.

"I do. But sometimes, love isn’t enough. You won’t understand now, but one day, you will."

I pray he never experiences this kind of pain. I want him to love and be loved in return. As much as it hurts, I hope he finds the kind of love Ethan and Isabella share—one that lasts.

A knock at my open door pulls my attention away.

"There’s someone here to see you, Sophia," Charlotte says.

I’d finally convinced her to drop the formalities. Thank God Letty talked me into letting her stay—she’s been a lifesaver, even helping with chores.

"Who is it, Mommy?"

I tell Charlotte to let them in before turning back to Liam.

"It’s a nice lady named Charlotte. She’s helping me around the house." My mind races, wondering who’s here.

Probably Letty or Daniel. Both have visited a few times to check on me.

"Why do you need help? You’re Super Mom—you never needed help before." His suspicion is back.

He’s right. I’ve always done everything myself—even when I lived in Ethan’s mansion. I thought if I proved I wasn’t spoiled like Isabella, who couldn’t even boil water, he’d see me differently.

How wrong I was. It didn’t matter. I was stupid to think he’d hate me less if I cooked all his meals, if I balanced work and home perfectly.

"Mommy?"

I’m saved from answering when Nathan walks in. He’s the last person I want to see, but at least he’s a distraction.

"Liam, I’ll call you back. Your uncle just got here, and I need to talk to him."

He sighs. "Okay, Mommy."

We say our goodbyes, and the moment the call ends, my smile drops.

"I thought I told you I never wanted to see you again," I say flatly, locking my emotions away.

He shifts nervously. "You’re my sister. I wanted to check on you."

A humorless laugh escapes me. "Sister? Really, Nathan? Because as far as I remember, I stopped being your sister nine years ago. Hell, longer than that, if we’re being honest. You had one sister, and you never let me forget it."

It still hurts. Rejection from my husband, my in-laws, even my own family. It’s a pain I’ve had enough of to last a lifetime.

"Sophia—"

I cut him off. "I stayed away from Isabella and Ethan like you asked. Now I’m asking you to stay away from me."

"We’re family."

I raise a hand. "No. You, Mom, and Isabella are family. I was never part of it, and you all made sure I knew that."

The words burn, but they’re true. They excluded me from everything, made me feel like an outsider.

"You gave Letty a chance. Why not us?" His temper flares.

"Letty has been kind to me. Unlike all of you, she didn’t treat me like garbage for a mistake I made at eighteen when I was stupidly in love with someone who’d never love me back."

Amelia had told me Nathan confessed the truth when their relationship got serious—after she noticed I was left out of family gatherings.

"Leave, Nathan. And don’t come back. Consider me dead. Forget you ever had a sister named Sophia."

I turn away, lying down on the bed. He’s silent for a moment before I hear his footsteps retreating.

Tears soak into my pillow. He asks too much. I gave them everything—love, even when they hated me. I kept hoping, praying, that one day they’d accept me.

Instead, they trampled that love and broke my heart over and over.

Now he wants to be part of my life? Doesn’t he realize it’s too late? They shattered me. There’s nothing left to give.

When it comes to them, I’m empty.
###Chapter 20

I sat at my desk, sifting through a stack of documents that demanded my attention. My fingers tapped impatiently against the mahogany surface, but my mind refused to cooperate.

Sophia.

Again, she had ignored my call. If it weren’t for Charlotte keeping me updated, I wouldn’t even know if she was still breathing.

The woman I once knew was gone. In her place stood a stranger—cold, distant, untouchable.

When Isabella announced her return, I had braced myself for chaos. I expected Sophia to be the same reckless storm she’d been in her youth. But she surprised me.

She stayed away.

I should’ve been relieved. Instead, it gnawed at me. The indifference. The silence. The way she haunted my thoughts like a ghost I couldn’t exorcise.

Gritting my teeth, I shoved the papers aside and strode to the floor-to-ceiling windows. The city sprawled beneath me, glittering and indifferent.

A knock.

"Sir, Chief Inspector Gregory is here," Olivia announced.

I hadn’t even heard her enter.

"Send him in."

Gregory stepped inside, his posture rigid despite his age. A retired detective, a former soldier—sharp as a blade, even now. We shook hands, and he took a seat.

"Any leads?" I demanded.

"Nothing concrete." His jaw tightened. "The gang’s vanished. No traces, no connections to the attacks on your ex-wife."

Frustration coiled in my chest. "There has to be something. Why target her?"

It made no sense. With the way things stood between us, if anyone should be in danger, it was Isabella.

Gregory exhaled sharply. "These people are professionals. No evidence, no witnesses. We’re chasing shadows."

The words settled like ice in my veins.

"Will they come for her again?"

His silence was answer enough.

I dismissed him with a terse nod. The moment the door closed, I snatched my phone.

"Send Maxwell up."

Within minutes, my head of security stood before me. His voice, permanently rasped from an old injury, grated against the quiet.

"You called, boss."

"Put two men on Sophia. Twenty-four seven. Close enough to intervene, far enough she won’t notice."

His brow lifted. "She’s still in danger?"

"Assume she is. I want her protected. At any cost."

Maxwell studied me, curiosity flickering in his gaze. He knew better than to question me.

"Consider it done."

As he left, I exhaled. The irony wasn’t lost on me. I’d never assigned her a guard before. Not even when Liam had two.

Hell, she had asked me what the hell was wrong with me.

And I didn’t have an answer.

The club’s private lounge hummed with low chatter. Sebastian scowled into his whiskey, shooting Nathan a look of pure disgust.

"Finally. Deal with him before I lose my damn patience."

Nathan looked like hell.

"I went to see Sophia," he muttered. "She told me to consider her dead. To forget I ever had a sister."

My grip tightened around my glass. "What the hell is her problem?"

Sebastian snorted. "Seriously? After years of treating her like garbage, you expected open arms?"

I shot him a glare. Unlike us, Sebastian had never gone out of his way to hurt her. He’d simply ignored her existence.

"You broke her," he continued. "Now she’s protecting what’s left. Wounded animals lash out. So does she."

The truth settled like a blade between my ribs.

Especially against those who hurt her first.

Silence stretched. Heavy. Suffocating.

Then—

"Isabella’s here," Sebastian announced.

My head snapped up. "Who invited her?"

Nathan shrugged. "She heard we were meeting. Wanted to say hi."

Annoyance flared. The last person I wanted to see.

The irony wasn’t lost on me.

For years, I’d dreamed of having her back. Now that she was here, it felt… wrong.

Forced.

Like a puzzle piece jammed where it didn’t belong.

And I had no idea why.
###Chapter 21

My hands trembled as I slipped into my dress, my stomach twisting with nerves. Two weeks had passed since I left the hospital, fully recovered. The doctors had cleared me, and I’d even returned to teaching a few days ago.

So much had changed in those two weeks. Amelia and I had grown closer, and so had Daniel and I. When he asked me out three days ago, I’d said yes without hesitation.

Daniel was good for me. He made me laugh, made me feel light. With him, the weight of my past—of Ethan Blackwood—faded into the background.

"Up or down?" I asked Amelia through the video call, holding up two hair ties.

She grinned. "Up. That neck of yours is a masterpiece. Trust me, Daniel won’t be able to stop imagining his lips there."

Heat rushed to my cheeks. I’d been married, for heaven’s sake, yet her words made me flustered.

"You’re exaggerating," I muttered, twisting my hair into a loose bun, letting a few strands frame my face.

"Not even a little," Amelia countered. "You’re stunning, Sophia. You just don’t see it."

I sighed. Years of being compared to Isabella had carved that belief deep into my bones.

The little black dress I’d chosen was simple—nothing extravagant. Ethan had never taken me out, so dressing up had never been part of my life. Black heels, nude makeup. That was as far as I’d go.

Amelia’s jaw dropped when I spun for her. "Daniel’s going to lose his mind."

The doorbell rang just as we hung up.

One last glance in the mirror, then I grabbed my clutch and hurried downstairs.

Daniel stood there, devastatingly handsome in a tailored black suit, holding a bouquet of roses. His eyes darkened as they swept over me.

"Beautiful," he murmured, lifting my chin with a finger before handing me the flowers.

I inhaled the sweet scent, struck by the novelty of it. Ethan had never bought me flowers. To him, I’d been an obligation.

After placing them in water, we left.

Nervous energy buzzed under my skin. What did people even talk about on dates?

"Is it weird that I’m terrified?" Daniel chuckled as he drove. "And I’ve been on plenty of these."

I laughed, tension easing. "I’ve been a wreck all day. My students called me out for spacing out."

He grinned. "I filed the same report three times."

The ease between us was refreshing. This was how things should’ve been with Ethan.

The restaurant was upscale, the kind of place Ethan frequented for business dinners.

Daniel noticed my discomfort the moment we sat. "You okay?"

I hesitated. "It’s just… this place. It’s not really me."

His expression softened. "Then let’s go somewhere that is."

Before I could protest, he stood, offering his hand.

Outside, he kissed my forehead. "Ice cream?"

I grinned. Maybe the night wasn’t ruined after all.

Then I felt it—the weight of a familiar gaze.

Ethan stood near the entrance, Isabella beside him. His stormy gray eyes burned into me, dark with something dangerous.

I looked away, gripping Daniel’s hand tighter.

Ethan had no right to glare. Not when he was the one who’d chosen Isabella.

Daniel pulled me into conversation, and for the rest of the night, I almost forgot the storm brewing in Ethan’s eyes.

Almost.
###Chapter 22

I had planned a perfect evening with Isabella, but everything went to hell the moment I spotted Sophia on a date with Daniel Carter.

"Ethan?" Isabella calls my name, but my brain short-circuits.

There she was—Sophia—wrapped in another man's arms. At first, I thought my eyes were deceiving me. I had been smug, thinking Daniel was just another snake, until I realized the woman he was with was her.

She looked breathtaking. A vision I'd never seen before. Her flawless skin glowed under the soft lighting, and that little black dress clung to her curves in ways that made my pulse spike.

Sure, I'd seen her naked before, but this was different. She had dressed up—something she never did for me. Probably because I never took her out, never gave her a reason to.

My jaw clenches as Daniel tucks a loose strand of hair behind her ear. Then he caresses her cheek and kisses her forehead, and something inside me snaps.

She smiles at him—a smile so radiant it nearly brings me to my knees.

"Ethan, you're hurting me!" Isabella snaps.

Only then do I realize I've been crushing her hand in mine. I release her immediately, but my gaze locks onto Sophia. Our eyes meet for a split second before she looks away, sliding into Daniel's car without a backward glance.

Rage burns through me. I want to destroy something—someone. Preferably Daniel, preferably with my fists.

Isabella yanks her arm free and storms off before I can stop her. She hails a cab and disappears, leaving me standing there like an idiot.

I don’t understand this fury. But one thing is clear—something is happening between Sophia and Daniel, and I hate it.

My mind is a warzone. Isabella doesn’t deserve this, not after everything I’ve put her through. But I can’t explain why the sight of Sophia with another man guts me like this.

I get in my car and drive straight to Sophia’s condo. I know she’ll be there.

Parking outside her building, I take the elevator up. She gave me a spare key once, so I let myself in.

She’s sitting on the couch, staring blankly at the wall.

"Isabella?" I say softly.

She turns, her blue eyes red and swollen. Guilt twists in my gut. This is the woman I’ve loved since I first understood what love was. And yet, here I am, breaking her heart all over again.

"What are you doing here?" she asks, her voice steady despite the pain in her eyes.

"I’m sorry about earlier—"

"Are you?" she cuts in, her gaze sharp. "Do you have any idea how it felt watching you lose your mind over my sister? Seeing you drool over her, then lose your shit when you realized she was with someone else?"

The guilt is suffocating. But even now, I can’t deny how seeing Sophia affected me. I should’ve controlled myself—could’ve—but I wasn’t prepared for that sight.

"Isabella—"

She stands abruptly, pacing like a caged animal. "Did you fall in love with her during your marriage? Is that it? Then why the hell did you ask me for another chance if you knew you didn’t love me anymore?"

"I’m not in love with Sophia," I growl.

I would know if I were.

"Really?" She scoffs. "Because from where I’m standing, the way you act around her says otherwise."

"We were married. Of course I care about her, but that’s it."

If that’s true, then why does the thought of her with another man make me want to commit murder?

"You’re a liar," she snarls, hurling a book at me. I dodge just in time. "Just admit it—you’re in love with her!"

"Calm down and let me explain!" I snap.

"I don’t want your explanations! They’re all lies!" She collapses onto the couch, tears streaming. "Just leave, Ethan. I can’t deal with you right now."

I should stay. But I don’t.

I drive aimlessly, my head a mess. Torn between two women. I have everything I ever wanted—Isabella, the love of my life. So why am I destroying it over Sophia?

She was always the wrong sister. The unwanted one. So why does she suddenly have this hold over me?

I slam on the brakes, realizing I’ve parked outside Sophia’s house. I don’t even remember driving here.

Now that I’m here, the need to see her consumes me. I knock urgently, my pulse wild.

The door opens. "Did you forget something?" Sophia blinks at me in surprise.

I don’t let her speak. I push inside, lock the door, and crush my lips to hers.

The kiss is desperate, hungry. She gasps, and I deepen it, my hands gripping her waist, pulling her flush against me.

I need more.

But then she shoves me away—and slaps me.

"What the hell, Ethan?" Her lips are swollen, her eyes wide. She looks wrecked.

The sting brings me back to reality. She’s just as shocked as I am.

Without a word, I storm out, slamming the door behind me.

I drive off, my hands shaking.

What the fuck am I doing?

Because I sure as hell don’t know anymore.
###Chapter 23


I remained frozen in place long after Ethan Blackwood walked out. The walls seemed to press in around me, suffocating me with their weight. There was no escape from the agony tearing through my chest.

Every breath hurt. Every thought was a blade twisting deeper.

Why was this happening to me? The question looped endlessly in my mind, but there were no answers. No explanations for why my life was unraveling even after finally getting the man I loved.

Tears spilled down my cheeks, hot and relentless. I hated this weakness—this inability to control my emotions. Angrily, I swiped at my face, furious at myself for letting them fall.

When Daddy passed away, I shattered. He had been my hero, my guiding light. Though our time together was limited after I moved away, every moment with him had been golden.

I thought I’d never recover from his loss. That the pain would consume me forever.

Then Ethan reappeared. He told me about his divorce from Sophia and asked for a second chance.

I had loved him since I was old enough to understand what love meant. Even after he destroyed me, that love never faded. It burned through nine years of separation—a relentless, unyielding fire.

My family had kept me updated on Ethan and Sophia’s marriage. Despite her efforts, he remained distant. Cold. Unmoved. He never loved her. He always asked about me. His feelings were obvious.

So why was he suddenly so invested in her life now? Had my family missed something? None of this made sense.

I stood abruptly, pacing like a caged animal. The unanswered questions were driving me mad. I needed clarity. I needed to talk to someone who understood.

Grabbing my phone, I dialed the one person who knew every detail of my life. She answered immediately.

"Hey, darling," Evelyn’s cheerful voice greeted. "How’s happily ever after treating you?"

Evelyn had been my rock since university. After Ethan broke my heart, she pulled me back from the edge. Without her, I would have drowned in depression and failed my classes. I owed her everything.

"Not great," I whispered.

I had believed everything was finally falling into place. That I would get my happy ending. Instead, I was drowning in doubt.

"What do you mean?" Confusion laced her tone. "Ethan asked for another chance, didn’t he?"

She might as well join my club of confusion because I had no answers either.

"At first, yes. But now… I’m starting to question everything. His feelings. His intentions."

The thought that everyone might have been wrong about his love for me was unbearable. That maybe, just maybe, he had developed feelings for Sophia after all.

"Tell me what’s bothering you," she said gently. "We’ll figure it out."

I was a top-tier lawyer. I analyzed facts, built airtight cases, and dismantled opponents with precision. But when it came to Ethan, logic abandoned me.

"He’s obsessed with Sophia," I admitted. "He thinks I don’t know, but for weeks, he’s been calling her, checking on her. He hired bodyguards, bought her a new car, even arranged for someone to watch over her."

I had waited for him to tell me himself, but he never did. Why go to such lengths if he didn’t care about her? This wasn’t normal ex-husband behavior.

"Why would he do that?" Evelyn sounded baffled. "Did something happen to her?"

I exhaled sharply. "Apparently, she’s a target. She was shot at Daddy’s funeral, and weeks ago, her car was blown up. She was injured."

Personally, I believed Sophia orchestrated it all to steal Ethan’s attention back.

Evelyn sighed. "If I were there, I’d smack you, Isabella. You’re a damn lawyer, yet you think your sister would go that far just for Ethan?"

"Exactly because I’m a lawyer," I countered. "I’ve seen women destroy lives just to reclaim exes who’ve moved on."

Love made people insane. And Sophia? Insanity was her default setting.

As teenagers, she sabotaged every date, ruined my outfits, even dyed my hair green. She didn’t stop until she tore Ethan and me apart.

"I’m not her biggest fan," Evelyn admitted, "but even she wouldn’t go that low. Besides, didn’t she file for divorce?"

I opened my mouth to argue, but she cut me off.

"Listen, I get why you’re worried. But Ethan was married to her for nine years. They have a son. Even if he’s not in love with her, he still cares. Given what’s happened, his concern makes sense."

Logically, she was right. But my gut screamed otherwise.

"That’s not what bothers me," I said. "It’s how he reacts when he sees her with another man. There’s this cop—Daniel Carter. The two times we’ve seen them together, Ethan lost it. Today, he nearly broke my hand after spotting them outside a restaurant."

Silence stretched between us as I relived the moment. The raw fury in Ethan’s eyes. The way his grip turned crushing.

"Define lost it," Evelyn demanded.

"He looked possessed. Like he wanted to tear Daniel apart. That kind of rage? It’s not just concern. It’s jealousy. Possession. And that only happens when feelings run deep."

The possibility terrified me. Could he love her without realizing it?

Evelyn exhaled. "This is messy. From where I stand, you have two choices: walk away or fight for him. Everyone couldn’t have been wrong about his feelings for you."

My answer was instant. "I’m fighting. Sophia stole nine years from us. I won’t let her take him too."

A weighted pause. Then, softly: "If that’s your choice, then you have to come clean. You’ve buried the truth so long, you’ve started believing the lie. No relationship thrives on deception."

Her words struck like a physical blow. She was right. But the truth? It would destroy everything.

Pretending was safer. Because perfection was the only advantage I had over Sophia. And without it, I’d lose him forever.
###Chapter 24

I’m still shaken by Ethan’s actions from a few days ago. What the hell got into him? Was he trying to sabotage his relationship with Isabella? Or was he deliberately trying to drag me into their mess?

She already believes I’m after her man—that I’d do anything to steal him away. What she doesn’t understand is that I just want peace. I don’t want Ethan. Been there, done that, and learned my lesson the hard way.

"Are you sure about that?" A nagging voice whispers in my mind. "You can’t deny you liked that kiss. It was exactly how you always imagined it—full of hunger and passion."

I shake my head, forcing the thought away. It was wrong. I’m determined to move on from Ethan and build a life—and love—of my own. My body’s betrayal meant nothing. Just biology. No emotions attached.

"Keep lying to yourself," the voice taunts.

I’m not lying. Or maybe I am. Either way, I refuse to overanalyze Ethan’s sudden, uncharacteristic behavior—or that unexpected kiss.

Pushing all thoughts of him aside, I focus on the coffee shop door. It’s five o’clock, and I’ve just finished work. Amelia and I planned to meet before heading home.

I take a bite of my cake just as the door swings open. Amelia walks in, scanning the crowd before spotting me. She rushes over, grinning.

"Sorry I’m late," she says, sliding into the seat across from me. "Last-minute meeting at the office."

I smile. "No worries."

"Already ordered, I see." She nods at my plate.

"Missed lunch. Starving."

She chuckles, flagging down a waiter to place her order. Once done, she leans in, eyes bright with curiosity.

"So? How was your date with Daniel?"

Honestly, Amelia has become more than just a friend in the short time we’ve known each other. She’s the kind of best friend I never had in high school—back when I was too obsessed with getting Ethan to notice me.

"It was… nice," I admit, a little shy.

Her face lights up. "Details. Now."

I laugh. "Not much to tell. Fancy dinner, then ice cream—which was my favorite part."

"Did he kiss you?" She practically vibrates with excitement.

I roll my eyes. Of course, that’s all she cares about.

"No. I could tell he wanted to, but he didn’t. Not sure if I’m relieved or disappointed."

"Why?"

"Part of me wanted to know what it feels like to be kissed by someone who actually wants me. The other part… I’m not sure I’m ready yet."

She studies me, silent for a moment. Then—

"Wait. Ethan never kissed you like that?" Her frown deepens.

"He did. But never like he meant it." My voice drops. "I saw him kiss Isabella once. It was… intense. Like he couldn’t get enough of her. He’s never looked at me that way."

I can’t meet her eyes. This is the first time I’ve admitted it out loud. I’ve kept the shattered pieces of my marriage locked away, too ashamed to let anyone see how much he broke me.

"But he kissed you like that last Friday," the voice reminds me.

A fluke. It meant nothing. It doesn’t erase years of rejection—of him avoiding my lips like they were poison. Even during sex, he’d kiss everywhere but my mouth.

"You deserve to be kissed like the world’s ending," Amelia says softly, squeezing my hand.

I exhale, grateful she’s not looking at me with pity.

"Aside from that, the date was perfect," I say, changing the subject. "Though I did see Ethan and Isabella. Looked like they were on a date."

"Seriously?"

"Yeah." I sip my drink, trying to forget how perfect they looked together.

Isabella was right. She and Ethan make sense. Everyone saw it then. Now, finally, so do I.

"Well, I hope he saw how stunning you looked," Amelia huffs. "Hope it sinks in that he let go of someone incredible."

I laugh. Amelia’s great for my ego. For once, someone isn’t obsessing over Isabella’s beauty or comparing us.

"So, nothing else exciting happened?" she presses.

"Nope." I shake my head.

I almost tell her about Ethan showing up at my place but stop myself. I trust her, but some things are better left unsaid. The last thing I need is Isabella finding out he came to me—and kissed me—after their date.

We fall into easy conversation, but I notice something’s bothering her.

"Okay, what’s wrong?" I push my plate aside.

"Nothing." She avoids my gaze.

"Spill it, Amelia."

I see the internal struggle in her eyes. Whatever it is, I won’t like it.

"It’s about Nathan," she finally says. "He’s really sorry."

I stiffen. Should’ve kept my mouth shut.

"We’re not doing this," I say through gritted teeth.

She sighs. "Sophia, please. It’s killing him that you won’t talk to him. That you were hurting, and he couldn’t be there. He’s hurting."

"He’s hurting?" My voice cracks. "Do you know how many years I’ve been hurting? The cruel things he’s said? He wants forgiveness, but he never forgave me for ‘hurting’ his precious sister. He told me I was dead to him. That he only had one sister. Do you have any idea how much that destroyed me?"

I’m trying to move on, but they keep dragging me back. Once again, his pain matters more than mine.

I stand, grabbing my bag. "If he can undo the damage he caused, maybe I’ll forgive him. Until then, we have nothing to say."

Tears glisten in her eyes, but I turn away. She calls my name, but I don’t look back.

I hail a cab, ignoring her as it pulls away.

No more tears. No more weakness. That chapter of my life is over.

At home, I pay the driver and head inside, relieved to be in my safe space.

As I unlock my door, a chill runs down my spine.

I’m being watched.

I glance around. Nothing unusual—just neighbors walking dogs, cars passing, joggers on their evening routes.

But the feeling lingers. A cold, menacing stare burning into my back.
###Chapter 25


I had just finished tidying up the living room when my phone buzzed. Cleaning always calmed me—something about the mindless repetition helped quiet the chaos in my head.

Now that I was fully recovered and could manage on my own, I’d dismissed Charlotte. She’d been an incredible help, but I didn’t need a nurse anymore. Independence suited me better.

I crossed the room and snatched up my phone. My finger hovered over the decline button when I saw Amelia’s name flash across the screen. Part of me was still irritated with her, but another part understood. If I loved someone, I’d probably move mountains for them too—even if it meant meddling in their fractured family relationships.

“Hey,” I answered, heading upstairs to my bedroom.

“Sophia, I’m so sorry.” Her voice cracked, raw with emotion. “I crossed a line. I promised I wouldn’t bring up Nathan again, and I did.”

The sincerity in her tone caught me off guard. She sounded genuinely remorseful, even a little heartbroken. I wasn’t used to apologies that felt this real. Most people in my life had a habit of hurting me and never looking back.

“Amelia—”

She cut me off. “You were right. We can’t just expect you to forget. To pretend he didn’t spend years tearing you down. No amount of regret erases that kind of pain. I love him—God, I do—but that doesn’t mean I can ignore how cruel he’s been to you. You’re kind, Sophia. And he broke you. How could I ask you to forgive that? It’s not fair. Our friendship means too much to me to ruin it.”

I exhaled, exhaustion settling deep in my bones. Forgetting would be easier. But pain like this? It doesn’t just vanish.

People say time heals everything. Lies. Some wounds never close. You just learn to live with them—or drown them out.

“Look, I get it,” I said finally. “I know how hard this must be for you. I do value our friendship. But I don’t want to come between you and Nathan. The last thing I need is him hating me more than he already does.”

“He doesn’t hate—”

I didn’t let her finish. “Please. We both know he does. He’s made that very clear. And I’ve accepted it.”

Honestly, you get used to it when your entire family—husband, in-laws, everyone—despises you. It stung like hell at first. Now? It’s just background noise.

She sighed. “I don’t want to lose you, okay? I’ll figure out how to keep you both in my life—separately.”

I doubted that would work. Straddling the line between two people you care about, who despise each other? That kind of balancing act never ends well.

I opened my mouth to say exactly that when another call buzzed through. My lips curved into a smile for the first time since my argument with Amelia hours ago.

“I’ve got to go. Liam’s calling, and I want to talk to him before bed,” I said, already eager to hear my son’s voice.

“Of course,” she murmured. “But… we’re good? I swear I won’t mention Nathan again.”

“We’re good,” I assured her, and meant it.

“Thank you,” she breathed, relief palpable. “Tell Liam I said goodnight.”

“Will do.”

I hung up and dialed Liam back immediately.

“Hello?”

I froze. That wasn’t Liam.

My mother’s voice—soft, trembling—sent ice through my veins. I hadn’t spoken to her since the airport. Of all the people who’d hurt me, her betrayal cut the deepest. A mother was supposed to love her child. Protect them. Mine had done neither.

Now that I had Liam, I couldn’t fathom how she’d done it. I’d never abandon him.

“Sophia? Are you there?” she whispered. “Please… say something.”

My throat locked. This was the mother I’d ached for as a child. A year ago—hell, a month ago—I’d have clung to this moment. But it was too late.

“I know you don’t want to talk to me,” she said quietly. “I’ll put Liam on. Just… know I love you.”

A bitter laugh escaped me. If this was her idea of love, I wanted no part of it.

I heard her call for Liam, and seconds later, his small voice filled the line.

“Hi, Mommy.” But he didn’t sound like his usual bubbly self.

“What’s wrong, sweetheart?”

“I miss you,” he mumbled. “It’s fun here, but… when can I come home?”

My heart shattered. I wanted him home. But his safety came first.

I was about to answer when a crash echoed from downstairs.

“Liam, let me check something. I’ll call you right back,” I said, already moving.

He agreed, and I hung up, gripping my phone as I crept downstairs. Maybe it was nothing. A fallen dish. A clumsy accident.

But the shattered glass of my back door—now swinging open—told me otherwise.

Someone was in my house. And I knew it wasn’t just a thief.

I fumbled for my phone, about to dial 911, when a sharp pain exploded at the back of my skull.

“This time, you won’t survive,” a stranger’s voice hissed.

Then everything went black.
###Chapter 26

My eyelids flutter open to find myself bound to a chair in my own living room, wrists secured tightly behind me.

"Well, well. Sleeping Beauty finally wakes up," a deep, gravelly voice mocks from the shadows. "I do enjoy it when my prey is conscious for the finale."

Ice floods my veins as the figure steps into view—a mountain of a man with a ski mask obscuring his face. His biceps bulge beneath his leather jacket, each thicker than my thigh. Everything about him radiates lethal intent, from the way he moves to the predatory gleam in his visible eye.

He settles onto my couch with unsettling familiarity, swirling my favorite merlot in my crystal glass. The bastard even kicked his boots up on my coffee table.

I test my restraints, but the ropes bite deeper into my flesh.

"Save your energy, sweetheart," he chuckles darkly. "You've been quite the nuisance, and I don't tolerate nuisances."

"Who sent you?" I demand, buying time. Surely someone noticed a break-in? The walls in my building are paper-thin.

"Let's just say you've got an admirer with deep pockets and shallow morals." His laugh booms through the room, making my skin crawl. "They want proof of your... permanent retirement."

My stomach plummets. This isn't some random thug from Ethan's world. This is a professional.

"Must be one hell of a paycheck," I say through clenched teeth. My mind races—Isabella wouldn't... would she?

"Enough to buy a small island," he confirms, drawing a hunting knife from his boot. "Now, how shall we do this? Slow and painful? Or quick and—"

I throw my weight backward before he finishes. The chair splinters on impact, white-hot pain exploding through my skull. Hollywood lied—this shit hurts.

"Clever girl," he snarls.

I'm on my feet in an instant, fumbling with the ropes as I bolt for the door. His tackle sends us both crashing into the hardwood.

"You'll pay for that," he growls, flipping me onto my back. His knee pins my hips as his free hand yanks at my sweatpants.

Panic turns my blood to acid. I buck wildly, but his weight crushes the air from my lungs.

"Please—I can double whatever they're paying!" I gasp.

His laughter curdles my stomach. "Nice try, princess."

Just as his fingers graze my bare skin, my hand closes around the shattered lamp base. The ceramic connects with his temple with a sickening crack.

He howls, clutching his head. The knife clatters to the floor between us.

I don't hesitate.

The blade sinks into his thigh just as my front door explodes inward.

Maxwell bursts through the wreckage, blood streaming down his face, flanked by two armed men. Our attacker swears violently and vanishes through the patio doors.

Sirens wail in the distance as Maxwell helps me up. My entire body trembles like a leaf in a hurricane.

Ethan and Daniel arrive with the police in a whirlwind of shouted orders. Daniel's at my side instantly, his warm hands checking for injuries while Ethan interrogates Maxwell.

"You had one job!" Ethan snarls, his knuckles white around Maxwell's collar.

"Enough!" My voice cracks. The room tilts dangerously. "My head... it's..."

Strong arms catch me as my knees give out. Two pairs of hands reach for me—Daniel's gentle and familiar, Ethan's possessive and sure.

In this moment of raw vulnerability, I don't know whose embrace I crave more. The man who's always been my rock, or the one who makes my pulse race with just a glance.

So I choose neither, letting the couch cushion absorb my silent tears instead.

Because the terrifying truth settles over me like a shroud:

Someone out there just paid a small fortune for my head.

And I have no idea why.
###Chapter 27

"Boss?" Maxwell's voice crackled through the phone, uncharacteristically unsteady.

I reluctantly pulled away from Isabella, who had been curled against my chest as we watched a movie. It had taken days of apologies and promises to earn her forgiveness after my latest screw-up. The last thing I wanted was to hurt her again.

But my mind was a mess.

Kissing Sophia while still tangled up with Isabella? What the hell was wrong with me? Even now, days later, the memory of Sophia's lips haunted me. But like everything else about her, I shoved it into the darkest corner of my mind.

I had waited years to be with Isabella. I wasn’t about to throw it all away over some fleeting, confusing attraction to my ex-wife. Sophia meant nothing.

Isabella and Liam were my world. Always had been.

"What?!" I snapped into the phone, irritated at the interruption of our date night.

Maxwell hesitated—something he never did.

"Spit it out," I growled. "I don’t have all damn night."

Isabella shot me a questioning look, but I shook my head and stood, moving away as she turned back to the movie.

"An intruder broke into Sophia’s house," Maxwell finally said. "I think it’s the same guy who’s been after her."

My blood turned to ice.

I didn’t hear another word. My heart hammered violently, fear gripping me like a vise. I was already moving—grabbing my shoes, my coat.

"Ethan, what’s wrong?" Isabella called, her voice laced with concern.

Her lips moved, but the words didn’t register. All I knew was that I had to get to Sophia. Now.

"I have to go," I muttered, already halfway out the door.

She called after me, but I didn’t stop. My body moved on autopilot—down the elevator, into the parking garage, into my car. My hands shook on the wheel as every worst-case scenario played in my head.

How the hell did he get inside? Where was Maxwell? If even a single hair on Sophia’s head was harmed, I’d bury him alive.

I broke every speed limit, screeching to a stop outside her house just as the cops arrived. Neighbors peered from their doorways, no doubt wondering about the commotion at nearly midnight.

The second I stepped inside, my heart stopped.

Sophia sat on the couch, a gash on her forehead, her lip split, the left side of her face swollen.

Rage burned through me.

She had just gotten out of the hospital, and now this? Whoever did this would pay. Slowly. Painfully.

I turned my fury on Maxwell. "You were supposed to be watching her."

His jaw tightened, but he didn’t defend himself.

"Are you okay?"

The soft question drew my attention back to Sophia. Daniel Carter—her new boyfriend—held her hand like he had any right to touch her. I clenched my fists, fighting the urge to rip him away from her.

"My head hurts," she whispered.

I knew Sophia. Knew she was holding back tears. The thought of her alone, attacked in her own home, made me sick.

She leaned back, eyes fluttering shut.

"Hey," I said sharply. "Keep your eyes open. Talk to me. What happened?"

"I’m just tired, Ethan," she murmured, voice small.

The raw vulnerability in her tone nearly brought me to my knees. I wanted to pull her into my arms and never let go.

Which was insane.

Because I didn’t feel anything for Sophia.

Right?

Gregory, the lead detective, stepped forward. "Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?"

Sophia winced but nodded.

"Good. Can you describe the man who attacked you?"

She took a shaky breath. "He wore a mask. But he was tall—around six feet—built like a tank. Shaggy brown hair."

"Did he say anything?"

"He said someone paid him to kill me." Her hands trembled. "No names."

My vision darkened. Someone wanted her dead.

Gregory rubbed his chin. "This confirms it. Her attacks aren’t tied to the gang threats. Someone else is targeting her."

"But why?" Daniel demanded, echoing the question screaming in my head.

Sophia had no enemies. She lived quietly—work and Liam. Who would want her dead?

Before Gregory could answer, an officer rushed in. "Sir, we found blood in the kitchen."

Sophia exhaled. "Probably his. I hit him with a lamp. Stabbed him with his own knife."

For the first time, Gregory smiled. "Perfect. We’ll run DNA."

Relief warred with fury. Once we found this bastard, he wouldn’t live long enough to see trial.

Maxwell’s men, Xavier and Samuel, entered, grim-faced.

"He got away," Xavier admitted.

"How?" I snarled.

Samuel swallowed. "He knows the area. Probably been watching her for months."

Gregory nodded. "Used the Reapers as a cover. If he’d succeeded the first time, we’d have blamed them."

Sophia shuddered just as paramedics arrived.

Then my phone rang.

Isabella.

Shit.

I had completely forgotten about her.

And now?

How the hell was I supposed to explain this?

Rushing to my ex-wife the second she was in danger?

Yeah.

Things had just gotten a hell of a lot more complicated.


###Chapter 28

Fury doesn’t even begin to describe what I’m feeling. I’m seething, boiling over with rage. Once again, she slipped through my fingers. Once again, Sophia defied death when she should’ve been lying in a grave.

“Explain to me how the hell she’s still breathing,” I demand, glaring at Vincent.

He shifts uncomfortably. “I swear, I had her this time. I was inches away from ending her when that damn bodyguard showed up.”

Does he take me for a fool? I know exactly what happened. All I’ve gotten from him are excuses since this operation began. Three failures. Three times she’s walked away unscathed. The only silver lining? I haven’t paid him a dime. Imagine handing over half a million dollars for nothing.

That money should’ve been motivation enough. It was supposed to ensure he finished the job on time.

I down my whiskey, the burn doing nothing to soothe my frustration.

“Really? You ‘almost had her’? Is that why you’re bleeding?” My voice is sharp, each word dripping with venom.

“I’ll get her next time. She won’t escape again,” he mutters, eyes glued to the floor.

“She’s already escaped you three times!” I roar, the urge to end his pathetic life overwhelming.

He stays silent, staring at the ground like it holds the answers.

This idiot has set me back months. Sophia was supposed to be dead long ago. Yet here we are, with her still breathing, still in my way.

I was told Vincent was the best. That he’d deliver. So far? Nothing but empty promises.

“How is it possible that you can’t kill one woman? How hard can it be?”

It’s baffling. Three attempts. Three failures. The third time should’ve been the charm, yet she’s still alive. Bruised, but alive.

“I don’t fucking know,” he snarls, frustration etched into his face. “I’ve never had this much trouble before. Usually, it’s done on the first try.”

I pace, agitation coiling in my chest. This was supposed to be simple. Sophia was the only obstacle between me and what I wanted. I’d planned this the moment I realized her death was necessary.

At first, I wanted it to look like an accident. The last thing I needed was cops sniffing around. The Reapers’ Angels provided the perfect cover—until they figured out it was all a setup. Now, they’ll come for Vincent, then me.

I didn’t go through all this just to lose.

“Fuck!” I hurl my glass against the wall, shattering it.

Time is running out. I should be reaping the rewards of my efforts. Instead, I’m nowhere near my goal. In fact, it feels further away than ever.

“Give me one last chance,” Vincent pleads.

I sneer. “So you can fail again? Not happening.”

What is it about Sophia that death refuses to claim her? I don’t believe in divine intervention, but it’s starting to seem like someone’s watching over her. Surviving three attempts isn’t just luck—it’s unnatural.

She’s the luckiest woman I’ve ever encountered. And her luck is pissing me off. I always get what I want. Always. But Sophia’s death? It’s proving impossible.

“I’d like to see you do better,” he scoffs, snapping me out of my thoughts.

That mocking tone is the last straw. I grab the nearest object—a whiskey bottle—and hurl it at his face. He doesn’t dodge. The bottle cracks against his skull, blood trickling from his brow.

A smirk tugs at my lips. His pain eases my anger, if only slightly.

“Care to repeat that?”

He clenches his jaw, glaring but silent. At least he knows when to shut up.

“There has to be a way to end this quickly. I’ve wasted enough time on her,” I mutter, more to myself.

If her death wasn’t crucial to my plan, I’d have given up by now. But every failed attempt risks exposure. And that can’t happen. Not when I’m this close.

“Look, she’s clearly not easy to kill. Add the cops and her billionaire husband’s protection, and it’s nearly impossible,” Vincent says, dragging me back to reality.

My hands clench at the mention of Ethan. I don’t need him stating the obvious. But fine, let him pretend he’s useful.

I sit, thinking. The old plan failed. I need something new. Something guaranteed.

This time, I won’t focus solely on her. If collateral damage is necessary, so be it. If I have to bring down an entire building to ensure she dies, I will.

A slow smile spreads across my face. The solution is clear.

“You’re smiling. Got a plan?” Vincent asks, hopeful.

His DNA is on file. I’ll deal with that before they connect him to me.

“As a matter of fact, yes,” I stand, smirking.

He mirrors my expression, satisfaction radiating off him.

This time, Sophia dies. Even if I have to do it myself.
###Chapter 29

I’m still recovering from the attack. My body aches, my mind is exhausted, and all I want is for this nightmare to end. Three times now, someone has tried to kill me. Three times, I’ve barely escaped. But how much longer can my luck hold? Whoever wants me dead won’t stop until I’m gone—until I never see Liam again.

A shudder runs through me as I remember how close I came to death. He was inside my house. He planned to violate me before ending my life. Tears well up, but I refuse to let them fall. I’ve cried enough these past few days. I’m tired of it. Tired of not understanding why. Why does someone want me dead? I haven’t wronged anyone—well, except Isabella. But even then, she’s with Ethan now. That should’ve been the end of it. I don’t deserve this.

My biggest fear? That they’ll succeed. That I’ll never watch my son grow up. That I’ll miss every milestone—his first day of school, his graduation, his wedding. The thought shatters me.

"Are you okay, miss?"

I blink and look up. An elderly woman stands before me, her kind eyes scanning my bruised face. The swelling has gone down, but the remnants of the attack are still there—a split lip, a black eye, a purple cheek.

"I’m okay, thank you," I say, forcing a smile that doesn’t reach my eyes.

I’ve been numb since the attack, moving through life like a ghost. None of this feels real. Part of me still expects to wake up.

"You don’t look okay," she insists. "Do you want me to call someone for you?"

If only everyone were like her—a stranger who notices pain and offers kindness.

"No need. Just… overwhelmed," I murmur.



She studies me skeptically. I force another smile, grateful but desperate to be alone.

Then she surprises me. She steps closer, squeezing my hand. "Things will get better. Always have faith."

With that, she leaves. I exhale, turning back to the shelves of soup cans.

"Wow, you look like hell."

That voice—sharp, mocking—makes me tense.

Olivia.

Ethan’s secretary. The woman who’s despised me for years.

I ignore her, but she steps closer, smirking. "Did someone finally put you in your place after you tried stealing another woman’s man?"

My hands clench. She’s baiting me. Everyone in the city knows what happened—thanks to some leak. The media has been relentless. Ethan’s trying to find the source, but the damage is done.

Olivia has always hated me. She’s taken every chance to tear me down. And Ethan? He never believed me when I said she was cruel. He always took her side, claiming I provoked her.

"I know you’re aware of what happened to me," I say calmly.

She shrugs. "Just stating facts. Wouldn’t be surprised if it was some woman you wronged. After all, that’s your specialty—stealing men. Because you’re nothing but a—"

I cut her off with a cold laugh. "Years of this, and you still recycle the same insults? Get creative, Olivia."

Her eyes widen. I’ve never talked back before. But now? I have nothing left to lose.



She recovers fast, lips curling into a venomous smile. "How does it feel knowing Ethan’s with Isabella now? Does it hurt?"

It does. But I’m letting go. Slowly. And Daniel helps—distracting me from thoughts of my ex.

I tilt my head. "Olivia, you spent years trying to seduce Ethan, thinking he’d notice you. But even when we were married, he never looked your way. You were just his secretary—nothing more. He’d rather sleep with a woman he hated than touch you. And now? With Isabella back? You’ll never have a chance."

Her face twists. "You bitch!"

She lunges. I sidestep, and she stumbles in her designer heels.

Before she can recover, I grab the nearest item—a carton of milk—and hurl it at her.

It explodes across her dress.

We both freeze. Then, with a shriek, she charges.

I grab whatever’s nearby—cereal boxes, cans—and throw them. A crowd gathers. Phones come out.

Just as she swings at me, strong arms yank us apart.

"Let me go!" I shout.

They don’t listen. Not until we’re shoved outside.

The manager glares. "You’re both banned. Come back, and I’m calling the cops."

Olivia seethes. "This is your fault!"

"I defended myself against a deranged woman," I snap.

She leans in, voice dripping venom. "You’ll pay for this, Sophia. Mark my words."

Then she storms off.



I drive home, emotions churning—anger, satisfaction, exhaustion.

But when I pull into my driveway, my heart lifts.

Daniel is waiting on my porch.

"Where were you?" He stands, worry in his eyes. "You didn’t answer your phone."

"Left it at home," I admit, unlocking the door.

He follows me inside. "Groceries?"

I wince. "Got into a fight. Got banned."

"What?!"

"Olivia provoked me. I’m just… tired of taking it."

I brace for scolding. Ethan would’ve berated me—called me childish, attention-seeking.

But Daniel?

He pulls me into his arms.

"I’m glad you’re okay," he murmurs, tipping my chin up. "Never apologize for defending yourself. I’m proud of you."

His words undo me.

Then his lips meet mine, and the world fades away.
###Chapter 30

"Are you absolutely certain about this, Sophia?" Amelia's voice drips with concern as I adjust my coat.

I'm preparing to head to Liam's school for the parent-teacher conference—an annual event Ethan and I were supposed to attend together.

He'd called earlier, suggesting we meet up since we hadn't seen each other in weeks. The last time we spoke was before the attack, when Amelia had been in Japan with Nathan for a business deal.

This is the perfect opportunity to get closer to Ethan, I think. But how?

I can't just throw myself at him. That's not how I operate.

I'd already confided in Amelia about the recent tension between Daniel and me. She knew the basics, though we hadn't discussed it further.

"But Sophia, are you sure this isn't just a rebound?" Amelia presses. "How long have you even known Daniel?"

"Just over a month," I admit. "But there's something about him. The way he looks at me, the way he sees me—it's different."

Amelia exhales sharply. "That's exactly what worries me. You're still raw from Ethan. What if you're just using Daniel as a distraction?"

I stiffen. "What do you mean, women like me?"

"Whoa, slow down," Amelia counters. "This is only your second date. Isn't it too soon to be making grand declarations? You're still in the trial phase."

Tonight, Daniel invited me to his apartment for dinner—a promise of the best meal I've ever tasted, following our first kiss.

Amelia sighs like she's dealing with a petulant child. "I just want you to be certain. Using one man to forget another never ends well. It only complicates things."

"I hear you," I say dismissively. "I have to go now."

"Fine. We're still on for Wednesday?"

"Absolutely."

After hanging up, I check the time—1 PM. Irritation prickles under my skin. Who schedules a parent-teacher meeting on a Saturday afternoon?

Grabbing my keys, I lock up and head to my car.

As I drive, Amelia's words echo in my mind. She's right—I'm inexperienced in dating. What does Daniel want? A relationship? Or just a casual fling?

More importantly—what do I want?

Am I using him to numb the pain of losing Ethan? The thought terrifies me. Daniel makes me forget Ethan, and that's dangerously alluring.

Pulling into the school lot, I kill the engine. Luxury vehicles surround me. Parents clad in designer labels sneer as I pass.

Typical.

This world disgusts me—where bank balances dictate worth. I grew up privileged but vowed never to become one of them.

Taking a seat, I wait.

And wait.

By 3 PM, Ethan still hasn't shown. His phone goes straight to voicemail.

Two hours later, I call Sebastian.

"Sophia?" His voice is gruff.

"I know you have my number," I snap.

A pause. He used to blame me for ruining Ethan's life, for stealing his chance with Isabella.

"Where's Ethan? We had a meeting about Liam. It's been three hours."

"He's not here. Took Isabella somewhere." His tone is almost apologetic.

I hang up before he can finish.

Mrs. Delaney calls me in.

Liam's face lights up on the video call—until he realizes Ethan isn't there. His smile shatters.

The entire meeting, I watch his heart break.

"He promised," Liam sobs. "He said he'd never break a promise!"

My own heart fractures.

By the time Ethan's Mercedes screeches into the lot at 6:30 PM, I'm a storm of fury.

"You're four hours late," I seethe.

"I know, I—"

"Save it. You were with Isabella while our son cried for you!"

Ethan's jaw tightens. "It won't happen again."

"It already did." I step closer, voice trembling. "Hurt Liam again, and I'll make you regret ever knowing me. I don't care if you own this city—I'll burn it down to protect him."

His eyes widen—like he's seeing me for the first time.

Good.

Let him look.

Let him remember.
###Chapter 31

I stare at my trembling hands. My mother’s voice is soft but firm. "I’m sorry, Ethan, but Liam refuses to speak to you."

The pain is sharper than any wound I’ve ever felt. Not even when Isabella walked out on me years ago. Liam is furious, ignoring my calls, shutting me out completely. Sophia was right—Liam should always come first, and I failed him.

I had taken Isabella out on my yacht, hoping the privacy would help smooth things over. She was still upset after learning I’d rushed to Sophia’s side instead of staying with her. It was supposed to be my grand gesture, my way of making amends. But I lost track of time, and my phone died.

I’d never seen Sophia truly angry before yesterday. The way she stood up for Liam, calling me out on my neglect, left me stunned—and weirdly proud. She had a spine after all.

"Ethan?" My mother’s voice pulls me back. "I’m going to hang up now."

"No, please—just put him on the phone. I need to apologize."

Liam had never refused to speak to me before. The weight of my broken promise crushed me.

Mom sighs. "You hurt him, Ethan. He was so excited for you to hear about his achievements. After the meeting, he cried while talking to Sophia. Liam never cries, and yet you brought him to tears."

I press my forehead against the wall, feeling like the lowest scum on earth. No excuses. I should’ve been there. Instead, I was too busy begging Isabella for forgiveness—again.

"I know," I mutter, defeated.

"Do you? You didn’t have to watch him break down. I’m glad Isabella’s back, and I understand you’re trying to fix things, but that doesn’t mean you abandon your responsibilities. Liam comes first, Ethan. Always."

"You don’t have to tell me. Sophia already ripped into me yesterday." I drag a hand through my hair.

"As she should. Mothers protect their children, even from their own fathers." Her words shock me.

My mother had never taken Sophia’s side before. If anyone had been against her from the start, it was Mom.

"I get it. But please, just try to convince him to talk to me?" I beg—something I never do.

After a pause, she agrees. Minutes crawl by. I’m about to hang up when—

"Hello?" Liam’s small voice cracks through the line.

"Hey, buddy." My throat tightens. "I’m so sorry I missed your meeting. I lost track of time, but I heard—"

He cuts me off.

"It’s because of her, isn’t it? Mommy’s sister. She’s why you weren’t there."

The accusation hits like a punch. Anger flares. Did Sophia poison him against Isabella?

"Who told you that? Your mother?" I force my voice steady.

"I’m eight, not stupid, Dad. Mommy didn’t say anything." His tone shifts, and I frown.

"What do you mean?"

"I saw her at your house when I called. What was she doing there at night if she’s not your girlfriend? Mommy said I should ask you."

My stomach drops. Isabella had been to my place twice. I didn’t know Liam had seen her. I thought I had more time before this conversation.

"Buddy—"

"I don’t like her. I’ll never accept her if you marry her." His voice is steel.

Damn it. Why did I think Liam would just welcome her? He’s loyal to Sophia—sometimes I think he loves her more than me.

"Is it because she’s not your mom?" Maybe he just resents her for taking Sophia’s place.

"I just don’t like her. And she’s Mommy’s sister. That’s wrong, Dad."

The eerie similarity to Sophia’s dislike for Isabella makes me wonder—has she been turning him against her?

"Listen, Liam. I’m dating Isabella, and I expect you to respect her. One day, I might marry her. She’ll be your stepmother. You’ll have to get used to her."

I needed to shut this down now.

"Never!" he shouts.

"Liam—"

"If you like her, fine. But I’ll never accept her. She’ll never be any kind of mother to me."

The line goes dead. I call back—straight to voicemail.

What the hell just happened?

Liam’s never been hateful. But he loathes Isabella without even knowing her.

I’ve made everything worse.

Before I can spiral, the front door opens. Isabella walks in, smiling. I gave her a key weeks ago.

She’s beautiful. After all this time, we’re finally together. But instead of everything falling into place, it’s all falling apart.

"Ethan?"

"What, Isabella?" My frustration bleeds into my voice.

How can I be with her if my son hates her? What the hell am I supposed to do?

"Talk to me. I’m here for you." Her voice cracks.

I rake a hand through my hair. "Liam and I had a fight."

Her face falls. "About yesterday?"

"Partly. But mostly because he saw you here. He doesn’t like you. How am I supposed to handle this? I love you both. I won’t choose. But how can we be together if he hates you?"

She’s silent for a long moment.

"Is this why you’ve been distant?" Her blue eyes search mine. "I’ve been back for months, and you haven’t kissed me. Not once. Is Liam holding you back?"

What do I say? Every time I try, something stops me. I pull away, settling for cheek pecks instead.

I’ve wanted her since I was twenty-one. Now that I have her, I can’t even kiss her.

"Yes," I lie.

The silence between us is suffocating.

And I have no idea how to fix any of it.
###Chapter 32

Today had been perfect. My dinner with Daniel had gone better than expected, and tomorrow I’d finally return to work. The day after? My birthday.

Just as I’d hoped, Daniel had managed to distract me completely. Within minutes of arriving at his place, I was laughing so hard my sides ached.

He cooked—and damn, could he cook. The meal was divine. There’s something irresistible about a man who can make you laugh while serving you gourmet food. The night was light, fun, exactly what I needed. And it got even better when I got home and found Liam still awake.

He’d finally calmed down. We talked about everything and nothing until he drifted off, phone still pressed to his ear. That conversation? The highlight of my day.

Now, I was baking. Comfort food cravings had hit hard—chocolate chip cookies and a rich chocolate cake. The scent of vanilla and cocoa filled the air when a knock interrupted me.

Wiping my hands on a towel, I opened the door. And there she was.

Isabella.

Part of me wasn’t surprised. The other part? Already exhausted.

“What do you want, Isabella?” I snapped, irritation sharp in my voice.

Her presence never meant anything good. The last time she’d shown up unannounced, I’d nearly died hours later.

Her expression was ice. “We need to talk.”

Every instinct screamed no. But against my better judgment, I stepped aside, leading her to the living room.

“Say what you came to say and leave,” I said, sinking into the couch. My eyes tracked her as she sat, her gaze sweeping over my home with obvious disdain.

She sneered. “Charming.”

I rolled my eyes. Of course, my cozy, lived-in space didn’t meet her sterile, designer standards.

“Are you here to critique my decor, or do you actually have a point?” I leaned back, arms crossed.



Isabella wouldn’t know warmth if it burned her. She preferred cold, empty mansions—nothing like the home I’d built.

“Stay away from Ethan,” she demanded, crossing her legs.

I sighed. “Seriously? You drove all the way here for this again?”

I was so tired of this broken record. How many times did I have to say it? I wasn’t interested in Ethan Blackwood. The man had caused me nothing but pain—why would I want him back?

“It’s not nonsense,” she hissed. “He’s trying to move on with me, but you keep pulling him back. Just let him go! He doesn’t love you, for God’s sake!”

The words shouldn’t have stung. But they did. I didn’t need reminders that I’d loved a man who despised me. That after years of trying, his heart had stayed locked away.

“And how, exactly, have I pulled him back?”

“Two weeks ago. He abandoned our movie night because he heard you were hurt.”

I stared at her. A top-tier lawyer, yet somehow dumber than a brick.

“How is that my fault, Isabella? He’s your man. Put a damn leash on him.”

Why were we even having this conversation? Didn’t she realize she’d won? She had him. All I wanted was to move on.

I’d met someone amazing—Daniel. I had hope for the first time in years. I wouldn’t let her drama poison that.

“I think you’re staging these attacks for his attention,” she mocked, smirking like she’d uncovered some grand scheme.

“Get out.” I stood, pointing at the door.

I was done. Today had been good. I wouldn’t let her ruin it.

She rose, eyes flashing. “Oh, did I hit a nerve? It’s only a matter of time before everyone realizes these ‘attacks’ are fake.”



“Are you done proving how delusional you are?” I snapped. “You think I’m faking? Then let me ask you something—who benefits if I die? Who’s my only enemy? You. With me gone, you get Ethan and full custody of Liam.”

Her face paled. Whether from shock at my accusation or the fact I’d figured it out, I didn’t care. It made too much sense.

Isabella wanted me dead for two reasons: revenge, and to erase me from Ethan’s life forever.

“How dare you!” she shrieked.

“No, how dare you come into my home spouting bullshit. We’re not kids anymore, Isabella. Grow the hell up. Now leave.”

Rage twisted her features. If looks could kill, I’d be six feet under. But I didn’t flinch. I was done being their punching bag.

I tapped my foot. “Going, or do I drag you out?”

With a scoff, she turned—but paused at the door.

“One more thing. Keep your brat out of my business.”

My blood turned to ice. “What did you just say?”

She smirked. “Liam’s a spoiled little pest. Once I marry Ethan, I’m shipping him off to boarding school. A child doesn’t get a say in my life.”

The slap echoed like a gunshot.

Her hand flew to her cheek. “You hit me?”

My palm stung, but I didn’t care. “Yes. And if you ever speak about my son like that again, I’ll do worse.”

“You’ll pay for this!” she screamed before storming out, slamming the door hard enough to rattle the walls.

How could Ethan want someone like that near Liam? The cruelty in her words—it wasn’t the Isabella I knew. Cold, yes. But never vicious.

I slumped against the wall, struggling to breathe. The joy from earlier was gone.

The oven timer beeped. The cookies were done, but my appetite had vanished. I left them to cool and turned on a movie, but an hour later, my mind was still racing. I hadn’t absorbed a single scene.

Giving up, I headed for a bath—until the doorbell rang. Again.

I groaned, assuming it was some kid selling fundraiser junk.

But it wasn’t.

Ethan Blackwood stood there, fury in his eyes.

Before I could react, he shoved me inside, slamming the door behind us. He backed me into the space between the foyer and kitchen, his voice a low, dangerous growl.

“What the hell is wrong with you?”

I shivered. “What?”

“Did you think Isabella wouldn’t tell me?” His jaw clenched. “Or that I wouldn’t see the handprint you left on her face?”

He paced like a caged animal. It hit me then—why he was here.

“You don’t understand—”

“Understand what?” he roared. “That you slapped her for no reason? That you accused her of trying to kill you with zero proof? Or should I ‘understand’ the vile things you said?”

I didn’t know what lies she’d fed him, but I knew one thing—she’d twisted everything.

“I won’t let you hurt her, Sophia.” His voice dropped, deadly quiet. “If you ever lay a hand on her again—”

This wasn’t the Ethan I knew. For the first time, I was terrified of him.

“Ethan, she threatened Liam—”

He cut me off. “She what? Defended herself after you attacked her? Told you I never loved you? Because she was right.” His eyes glinted, cruel. “Listen carefully. You’re nothing. You always will be. You brag about sleeping with me, but the truth? I fucked you because you were convenient.”

My vision blurred. “Stop.”

He didn’t. “You were a mediocre lay at best. Every time I was inside you, I imagined her. Every time I came, it was her face I saw. You were just easy. A warm hole to use.”

The second slap of the night cracked through the air.

His head snapped to the side. Tears streamed down my face, his words carving into me like knives.

“Get out,” I whispered. “Take your guards. I don’t want your help. I don’t want you. From today, you’re dead to me.”

I turned, climbing the stairs on shaky legs.

“You have two minutes to leave before I call the police.”

Upstairs, I locked my bedroom door. Moments later, I heard him go.

Then, I collapsed.

Ethan had destroyed me—without laying a single hand on me. His words had shattered me, leaving nothing behind.

I sobbed until my throat burned. My chest ached, my heart in pieces. He’d broken me over lies.

But I’d get up. I’d move forward.

And for every cruel word he’d spoken?

Karma would come for him. And for Isabella.

I’d never forget.

And I’d never forgive.
###Chapter 33

My phone buzzes for what feels like the hundredth time today. Amelia's name flashes across the screen, but like all the other times, I ignore it. She's been blowing up my phone since yesterday.

I wasn't in the right headspace to talk to her. She was still tied to the world—and the people—I desperately wanted to escape. That left me at a crossroads.

"Another one," I tell the bartender the second my phone stops ringing.

Today was my birthday, and this was how I was celebrating it. Alone in a dimly lit bar, drowning my sorrows in some overly sweet cocktail, still reeling from Daniel's cruel words.

I've tried to push them out of my mind. I've tried even harder to forget every venomous syllable he spat at me, but it's impossible. They're seared into my brain like a brand.

We'd been married for years, yet it never once crossed my mind that he saw me as nothing more than a cheap replacement for Isabella in bed. My heart had shattered over and over again since that day at my house.

I should have been shocked that he believed every word out of Isabella's mouth, but I wasn't. Of course he'd trust anyone over the woman he'd spent nine damn years with.

Whoever said words cut deeper than fists was right. This time, I feared Daniel might have broken me beyond repair.

"Here you go," the bartender says, sliding another drink toward me.

His gaze lingers with sympathy, like he knows exactly why I'm here. He must see heartbroken women like me every night.

I take the glass without meeting his eyes. I didn’t need his pity. What I needed was a new heart—one that wasn’t stained with pain. A soul untouched by Daniel’s cruelty.

If I’d known this was my future years ago, I would’ve run. If I’d known loving Daniel would destroy me like this, I would’ve fled to another country—hell, another planet—just to escape him.

I wish I could shake some sense into my younger self. Maybe then I could’ve avoided this agony.

Sipping my drink, I stare blankly ahead. My mind is numb. I wasn’t drunk yet, but the buzz was creeping in. That’s what I wanted—a temporary escape from the constant ache.

I down the rest of my drink and glance at the dance floor. People moved in sync with the music. I hadn’t danced in forever. Tonight, I just wanted to let go. After all, it was my damn birthday.

I push off the stool and weave through the crowd. Closing my eyes, I let the bass take over. My body moves on its own, and for a moment, the pain fades. Here, in this fleeting second, I could pretend I was whole.

Song after song, I lose myself in the rhythm. Men press against me, whispering invitations, but I shake them off. I wasn’t here for that.

When exhaustion finally seeps into my bones, I stumble back to the bar and collapse onto a stool. Just as I order another drink, my phone rings again.

I almost ignore it, assuming it’s Amelia—but then I see Liam’s name.

I answer.

"Sophia?" His voice is sharp with concern. "Where the hell are you? Amelia’s been losing her mind trying to reach you. She called me at three in the morning."

I frown. How did she even get his number? Then I remember—I gave it to her. She’d insisted, just in case.

"I’m fine," I mutter, my voice too loud over the music. "I just don’t want to talk to her right now."

"Are you at a club?" he demands as someone shrieks in the background.

"Something like that."

"Are you drunk?"

"Just buzzed." (Though I fully intended to drink until I forgot my own name.)

"Do you have a ride home?"

I laugh at that. His cop instincts were kicking in, and part of me liked it. Liked that he cared.

"No, but I’ll grab a cab."

"No, you won’t. Give me ten minutes."

Then he hangs up.

I blink at my phone. What did he mean by that? Shrugging, I push the thought aside. Tonight was about forgetting.

I don’t know how much time passes before someone slides into the seat beside me. I look up—and freeze.

Liam.

His blue eyes lock onto mine.

"Liam? How are you here?"

"I told you I’d be here in ten," he says, frowning. "Don’t you remember?"

I stare at him like he’s a hallucination.

"I remember. I just didn’t think you were serious."

He studies me, and I study him back. Don’t get me wrong—I liked him. But tonight wasn’t about him. Tonight was about me and my pain.

"What are you doing here, Sophia?" His voice is tight. "You don’t strike me as the type to drink alone at two in the morning. Don’t you have work tomorrow?"

I didn’t. After what happened with Daniel, I couldn’t face it. I’d extended my leave, lying that I wasn’t fully recovered.

"It’s my birthday," I say instead. "I just wanted to celebrate."

The music had died down, so I didn’t have to shout.

"Alone? In a bar at this hour?"

How could I explain that no one remembered my birthday? That even when I was married, Daniel forgot every year? That my family stopped acknowledging it nine years ago?

I shrug. "There’s no one left to celebrate with me."

His expression flickers with shock before he schools it. Without a word, he helps me off the stool and leads me to a private booth.

He turns to me, his gaze intense. "What happened?"

The question feels like a blade. If I wanted this—wanted him—I had to be honest. Even if it ruined everything.

I take a shaky breath.

"It’s because when I was eighteen, I slept with Isabella’s boyfriend and got pregnant."

Don’t hate me. Sophia’s past will be fully revealed next chapter.
###Chapter 34

Nine years ago.

My phone buzzes with a notification, jolting me awake from another sleepless night. For two years now, sleep has been elusive.

I blame Ethan. My heart and mind refuse to settle when he's not around. The restlessness started when he left for university. During term time, I barely sleep—but when he’s home for breaks, I sleep like a baby.

Groaning, I grab my phone. The notification sends a jolt of excitement through me.

I paid someone to install a tracking app that alerts me whenever Ethan is nearby. Right now, it’s telling me he’s back in town.

I leap out of bed and throw on clothes. He’s probably with Isabella or Nathan or Sebastian, but I don’t care. I just need to see him, even from a distance.

Once dressed, I slip out through my bedroom window. My room is at the far end of the house—no one ever hears me leave.

I land safely and start walking, pulling out my phone to call an Uber.

"This is a terrible idea," a voice whispers in my head.

I ignore it. My mind is already flooded with images of Ethan. It’s been months. My eyes ache for the sight of him.

"Sophia, go home. You’re making a mistake," the voice insists.

I freeze. No. Nothing about Ethan could ever be a mistake. I shove the doubt aside and keep walking.

Minutes later, the car arrives.

"Please, Sophia, turn back," the voice pleads as I climb in.

My body tenses, torn between desire and reason. But I silence the warning and shut the door.

I should have listened.

Thirty minutes later, we stop outside a dingy bar. I pay the driver and step out, staring at the place in disbelief. This isn’t Ethan’s scene at all.

Steeling myself, I flash a fake ID and slip inside. I find a shadowed corner and scan the room. Within seconds, I spot him—alone.

I wait, expecting his friends to show up, but no one does.

"You’ve seen him. Now leave," the voice hisses.

I ignore it. This might be my only chance. With Isabella not here, maybe—just maybe—he’ll notice me.

Taking a deep breath, I approach him.

"Hey, Ethan," I say softly.

He turns, flashing me a dazzling smile. It catches me off guard. We barely speak—he usually goes out of his way to avoid me.

"Little Sophia!" he slurs. "How are you?"

That’s when I realize—he’s drunk. That’s the only reason he’s smiling at me.

I sit beside him. He orders me a drink. The first sip is revolting, but I force it down.

"How’s school?" I ask, trying to relax.

He smirks, nudging my shoulder. "Is that really what you want to ask?"

"No. I want to know why you’re here alone, drinking. But I didn’t want to be rude."

He sways, leaning closer. "Aren’t you sweet?" Then he goes back to his drink.

"Are you okay?" I ask. He’s not acting like himself.

He ignores me. I keep drinking, staying quiet.

I should have listened.

"She doesn’t want to marry me," he mutters after a while.

I blink, already feeling the alcohol. "Who? Isabella?"

"Yeah. I proposed. Had the ring, the perfect moment. She said no."

My stomach twists. He asked her to marry him? I swallow the hurt.

"She said she’s not ready. Wants to focus on school. Doesn’t she love me?" His voice cracks.

I don’t know what to say. Part of me is relieved she refused. The other part aches for him.

"You’re amazing, Ethan. Her loss. Screw her—you deserve better." I raise my glass.

He stares at me, then grins. "You’re right. Screw her." He clinks his glass against mine.

We stay for hours—talking, dancing, drinking. By the time we leave, we’re both wasted.

He suggests I stay in his hotel room. I agree—I can’t go home like this.

In the room, the second the door closes, he’s on me. Kissing me, tearing at my clothes.

"Fuck, I’ve wanted this for so long," he slurs, stripping off his own clothes.

I giggle. "Me too. Are you sure?"

"Definitely."

He leads me to the bed. Everything blurs—his touch, his kisses. It hurts at first, but then it doesn’t.

"Isabella," he groans as he finishes.

My heart stops.

I should have listened.

"Fuck!" A panicked shout wakes me.

I jolt up, disoriented. Ethan is pacing, shirtless. I’m naked.

Horror crashes over me.

"No, no, no," I whisper, clutching the sheets.

His eyes burn with rage. "What the hell happened? Why are you in my room?"

I scramble for words. How do I explain the tracking app? That I never meant for this to happen?

I grab my clothes, hands shaking. The soreness between my legs confirms it wasn’t a dream.

"I found you at the bar. We drank. That’s all I remember," I lie.

He’s furious, guilt twisting his face. "You expect me to believe that? You’ve been obsessed with me for years!"

I dress quickly, avoiding his glare.

"You think I planned this?" I gesture at the mess. "I was drunk too."

He grips his hair like he might rip it out. "I thought I was with Isabella. She’ll never forgive me."

The words gut me. He didn’t even know it was me.

I reach for him, wanting to comfort him.

He shoves me away. "Don’t touch me, you bitch!"

Tears spill as I stand. "Ethan, I didn’t mean for this—"

"Get out. I never want to see you again."

I leave, shattered.

Two days later.

"Where is that slut?" Isabella’s scream echoes through the house.

My heart pounds. She knows.

Before I can hide, my door slams open. Isabella storms in, mascara streaking her face.

She slaps me. Again. Again. I don’t stop her. I deserve this.

"Isabella!" Our father’s voice booms from the doorway. "What’s going on?"

Our parents stare in shock.

"She’s no sister of mine!" Isabella shrieks.

Mother sighs. "What did she do now?"

"She slept with Ethan!"

Their disgust is instant. Father’s glare turns icy.

"I was drunk too," I whisper.

"Liar!" Isabella kicks me. "Ethan would never want you!"

Father wraps his arms around her. "I’ll never forgive you for this, Sophia."

Mother’s voice is cold. "You disgust me."

They leave me on the floor, sobbing.

My life will never be the same.

###Chapter 35

Two months had passed.

My hands trembled as I stared at the pregnancy test, watching in horror as the second line darkened, confirming what I already feared.

I was pregnant.

Ethan Blackwood’s baby.

The past few months had been hell. I had become an outcast—not just in both families, but at school too. Everyone knew what had happened between me and Ethan, but no one believed me when I said I was drunk.

The blame fell entirely on me. I was the slut who had seduced my sister’s boyfriend while he was wasted.

At school, I was bullied. In town, I was shunned.

My parents barely spoke to me anymore. Isabella had cut me off completely, declaring me dead to her. As for Nathan? It was like I didn’t exist in his world. And Ethan? I hadn’t seen or spoken to him since that night.

My heart had shattered over and over again these past weeks, with no relief from the constant pain and rejection. If I thought life was unbearable before, it was a thousand times worse now.

I was completely alone.

And now, I was pregnant.

Would they force me to get rid of the baby? I wouldn’t put it past them. They were still trying to get Ethan and Isabella back together after she had dumped him.

Glancing around my room, I made a decision.

I couldn’t stay here anymore.

Not for me. Not for my baby.

I placed a hand on my stomach, silently promising this child all the love I had been denied.

Ethan and Nathan were home, so both families had gone out for brunch. Of course, I wasn’t invited. They didn’t want me anywhere near Ethan. Hell, none of them wanted to see my face. They all pretended I didn’t exist.

I started packing frantically. I had some savings from my part-time job—enough for a fresh start. I could keep working until I was eight months along to save more. My father had cut me out of his will, so I had no trust fund to fall back on.



I shoved only the essentials into my suitcase.

Just as I was finishing, the door swung open.

Victoria stood there, her expression cold.

Shit. They weren’t supposed to be back so soon.

“What are you doing?” she asked flatly, eyeing my suitcase. Her voice held no emotion—like she was speaking to a stranger.

“Isn’t it obvious?” I turned to zip my bag. “I’m leaving. No point staying where I’m hated.”

She said something else, but I didn’t listen. I needed to get out. The farther I got from these people, the better.

“What the hell is this, Sophia?” Her sharp tone made me freeze.

I turned slowly.

My stomach dropped.

She was holding the pregnancy test.

Fuck. I had left it on the vanity.

“Nothing. It’s a friend’s,” I lied.

“You don’t have friends.” Her voice was icy. “Is this why you’re running? First, you ruin Ethan’s relationship with Isabella, and now you’re trying to steal his child?” She paced the room, her anger palpable.

“How do you even know it’s his?” I snapped, frustration boiling over. “You all think I’m a slut—it could be anyone’s.”

I just wanted to leave. Was that too much to ask?

“You’re not going anywhere,” she hissed. “Not until we confirm if that baby is Ethan’s.”

Before I could react, she stormed out—locking the door behind her.

I was trapped.

Screaming wouldn’t help. I needed to think.

The window was barred—they’d secured it after realizing I’d snuck out that night.

I sat down, forcing myself to breathe. There had to be a way.

My phone buzzed. Ethan’s name flashed on the screen.

I ignored it.

Of course, Victoria had told him. Why else would he call the girl he believed had taken advantage of him?



The window was my only option.

Grabbing a chair, I smashed the glass. The wooden planks gave way after a few hard shoves. I pushed my suitcase out first, wincing as it hit the ground.

Luckily, my room was at the far end of the house. No one would hear the noise.

Careful of the broken glass, I climbed down.

Freedom.

I grabbed my suitcase, already pulling up the ride-share app on my phone.

My relief was short-lived.

I collided with someone.

Looking up, my blood turned to ice.

Ethan stood before me, his stormy gray eyes burning with fury.

“Were you seriously trying to run away with my child?” His voice was dangerously low.

I dropped my suitcase, throwing my hands up. “I already told your mother—it’s not yours.”

There was no way I was letting my baby grow up in this toxic mess, surrounded by people who hated me.

“You’re lying,” he snarled. “You were a virgin. You might’ve fooled her, but I know that baby is mine.”

I stiffened. How did he know?

“The sheets had blood on them,” he said coldly.

I scoffed. “That doesn’t prove anything. I could’ve slept with a dozen men after.”

His eyes darkened like a brewing storm.

Just then, my ride pulled up.

“I’m sorry I ruined things with Isabella,” I said quickly. “But I have to go. My life isn’t here anymore. I hope you two work things out.”

I tried to step around him, but his grip locked around my wrist.

He handed cash to the driver, dismissing him.

“Ethan, let me go!” I yanked my arm, but he didn’t budge.



“No. We’re getting married. Now. The judge is waiting at your parents’ house.” He dragged me toward the mansion.

“Are you insane? Why would you marry someone you hate?”

“Because that child is mine,” he growled, tightening his grip. “And I won’t let it grow up without a father.”

Panic clawed at my chest. This wasn’t happening.

“We don’t have to do this!” I pleaded. “Tell everyone it’s not yours. I’ll disappear. No one will ever know. Isabella will take you back—”

He stopped walking.

For a second, I thought I’d gotten through to him.

Then—

“No.” His voice was steel. “I may hate you, but I won’t abandon my child.”

He hauled me inside, where the judge, Nathan, and my parents waited.

Thirty minutes later, it was done.

We were married.

Ethan stormed out immediately after, leaving me with my so-called family—who looked at me like I was the devil.

Soon, I was alone.

I placed a hand on my stomach and forced a smile.

Maybe this was a blessing in disguise.

Right then, I made a promise to my baby—they would be born into a loving family.

I would make Ethan fall in love with me.

Somehow.

I smiled, not knowing then how deeply he would break me.
###Chapter 36

Present day.

Sophia

"So you understand now... they have every reason to despise me. I destroyed their love," I murmur, tears welling in my eyes.

Reliving the past is always agonizing. I was naive. Foolish. Believing I could make Ethan Blackwood love me after I shattered his life. Nine years later, and I’m still paying the price for loving him.

"It wasn’t your fault," Daniel says softly, his fingers tracing mine.

"But it was." The tears spill freely now. "I let my obsession consume me, and because of that, I made the worst mistake of my life."

If only I could turn back time. If only I could undo it all. I’ve lived drowning in regret. I wish I had listened to that voice in my head—the one screaming at me to stop. It would have spared me so much pain.

God, I wish I had known sooner that I was pregnant. I would have run. Disappeared. Never told Ethan about Liam. No one would have known. It sounds cruel, but looking back, it would have spared my son from witnessing the endless battles between his parents.

I would have gone somewhere no one knew me. Far from my family. Far from Ethan. A place where no one could find us. And honestly? I doubt they would have even tried.

"Sophia?"

"Hmm?" I blink, pulled from my thoughts.

"I said it wasn’t your fault. You were drunk too. If they blamed you, they should have blamed him just as much." His smile is reassuring, but it’s his words that stun me.

"You... believe me?" I whisper, shocked.

No one—no one—has ever believed I was drunk that night. They all painted me as some scheming villain who took advantage of an innocent man.

"Of course I do. Don’t you think you’re innocent too?" His blue eyes bore into mine, as if peeling back every layer of my pain.

I exhale shakily. "I got so tired of hearing it was my fault. That I wasn’t drunk at all. That I wanted it. After a while, I started believing them. Even doubting my own memories."

It’s pathetic, really. When everyone insists you’re guilty, you start questioning your own truth.

Sometimes, I wonder if the suffering Ethan put me through was my punishment. Divine retribution for wanting a man who wasn’t mine. That’s what everyone told me, anyway. That I deserved the pain.

You learn to swallow their words when they’re forced down your throat enough times. That’s what happened to me. Eventually, I believed them. Believed I was the monster they claimed.

The only light in that darkness was Liam. I’d never regret him. He saved me. Anchored me when I wanted to let go. When the loneliness suffocated me so badly I considered ending it all.

It was after his birth. The constant hatred, the relentless pain—it nearly broke me. I knew Ethan would care for him. He adored Liam the second he held him.

But I clawed my way back from that edge. Because leaving Liam would have meant leaving him to her. Isabella. I refused to let her poison my son with the same venom she spat at me.

Now, seeing the vile things she said about Liam? I’m glad I stayed. I won’t let her hurt him.

"You’re not to blame. Never," Daniel says firmly. "You were both drunk. Your parents should be ashamed for dumping all the guilt on an eighteen-year-old. Ethan was twenty—he should have taken responsibility instead of letting you drown in blame."

"But I went to him that night."

"Doesn’t matter. He gave you alcohol knowing you shouldn’t have been drinking." He pulls his hand from mine, raking it through his hair. "The more I learn about Ethan and your family, the more I despise them," he mutters, more to himself than me.

I stay silent. Because honestly? I’m starting to hate them too.

"Come on." He stands, helping me up.

"Where are we going?" I ask, reluctant to leave. The thought of returning to an empty house makes my chest ache.

"Taking you home. I don’t like watching you drown yourself in alcohol to forget."

Before I can protest, he’s guiding me through the crowd and out of the bar. The night air bites my skin, and I shiver. Without a word, he shrugs off his leather jacket and drapes it over my shoulders.

The drive is quiet, but the silence isn’t uncomfortable. My mind races—part of me clings to Daniel’s words, but the guilt still festers. Three lives ruined because of me.

Too soon, we pull into my driveway. Daniel kills the engine and walks me to the door like the gentleman he is.

I fumble with my keys, then pause. "Do you want to come in?" I ask, voice rough. "I’m not done yet. Still not drunk enough to numb the pain."

His brows knit together. "You’re planning to keep drinking just to forget?"

I nod. I just need a few hours of escape.

His gaze darkens. I see the exact moment his resolve snaps, heat flooding his eyes.

"If that’s what you need," he says, voice dropping lower, "then I’ve got a better remedy."

He steps inside, shutting the door behind him. Then his lips crash into mine, and for the next few hours, he shows me exactly how much better his remedy is.

###Chapter 37

Golden sunlight spills across my face, pulling me from sleep. For a disoriented moment, I don't recognize my own bedroom. Then the weight of Daniel's arm draped possessively over my waist brings everything crashing back.

My pulse skyrockets. I can't let him wake up now. Not when I'm this close to hyperventilating. Not when my thoughts are this tangled. Moving with glacial slowness, I slip from beneath the covers.

He shifts, mumbling something unintelligible, but remains asleep. I exhale shakily while pulling on yesterday's discarded clothes and retrieving my phone from the nightstand.

The bedroom door creaks like a betrayal when I open it. I freeze, blood roaring in my ears. Glancing back, I find Daniel still sprawled across my bed - sheets tangled around his hips, exposing those ridiculous abs, one muscular forearm thrown over his face. I bite my lip hard and escape.

Descending the stairs feels like a walk of shame despite being in my own damn house. The pleasant ache between my thighs serves as undeniable proof of how thoroughly Daniel addressed my... discomfort last night.

The kitchen becomes ground zero for my meltdown. All the panic I'd suppressed comes roaring back like a tsunami.

"Get a grip," I whisper to the empty room. "Adults do this all the time." My traitorous heart only pounds harder.

I wear grooves in the tile with my pacing. How did this happen? I swore no man but Ethan would ever touch me again. Yet here I am - not just letting Daniel kiss me, but welcoming him into my bed, my body.

Exhausted, I collapse onto a barstool. My restless foot taps a frantic rhythm against the floor. What's the protocol here? Do I make breakfast? Is this a one-time thing? Will he even want to stay?

My palm flattens against my pounding heart. I've never done casual before. Even before Ethan, I believed sex meant something.

"You don't need love," a sly voice murmurs in my head. "Just chemistry."

My vibrating phone interrupts the thought. The screen lights up with two words:

HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

My stomach drops when I see the sender: Ethan Blackwood. Shock curdles into rage.

The fucking audacity. Seven years of marriage without a single birthday wish. Countless cruel words. And now this? Today of all days? Hours after I've been with another man?

It's not fair to compare, but Daniel... God, Daniel wrecked me in the best possible way. The passion, the intensity - everything missing with Ethan. Positions I didn't know existed. Pleasure so sharp it bordered on pain.

The only time Ethan ever touched me like that was our first time - when he thought I was Isabella.

I always knew something was missing between us. Now I understand - it was desire. Because I wasn't her.

I shove the thought away violently. I can't stomach the idea that even in our most intimate moments, Ethan was holding back, wishing I was someone else.

Distraction comes in the form of more birthday texts - from Nathan, Amelia, Victoria, even Sebastian. I'll respond to Amelia later. The others can wait.

Why now? What do they want from me?

"Absolution," the voice whispers.

Forgiveness. Such a small word for such an impossible thing.

How can I forgive when they never did? How can I move on when they shattered me? Ethan was right - we both drank that night, but only I paid the price. Only I endured the names, the scorn, the isolation.

The anger builds like a storm. Hot tears threaten, and this time I let them come.

I'm so tired of being the strong one. That night cost me just as much as it cost Ethan. But no one saw my guilt. No one cared about my pain. It was always about Ethan and Isabella. Always him.

Why did I have to break to keep us together? Why was my suffering necessary for their happiness? They destroyed me, and no one even acknowledges it.

Something inside me snaps.

The scream that tears from my throat sounds feral. Glass shatters as I hurl a vase against the wall. Wood splinters when I kick a chair. Every broken thing mirrors the fractures in my soul.

I hate them. I hate Ethan most of all.

"Sophia."

Daniel stands in the doorway, shirtless and wide-eyed, taking in the destruction. I collapse to my knees, not caring about the glass biting into my skin. Physical pain is nothing compared to this.

"I gave him everything," I sob. "And he left me empty. How do I live like this, Daniel? I'm so tired of carrying this weight."

His arms wrap around me. "Let it go," he murmurs against my hair. "Just let it all out."

And I do. My nails score his skin as I pour years of anguish into his shoulder. He bears it silently, holding me together as I fall apart.

When the storm passes, he carries me upstairs like something precious. Exhaustion pulls me under, but for the first time in years, I feel... light.

However God judges my sins, I've paid my penance. The past can stay buried now. It's time to step into the light. Time to finally live.
###Chapter 38

I stood before the mirror, adjusting my tie with stiff fingers. The Hope Foundation's annual gala loomed before me like a prison sentence. As one of their major donors, my attendance was non-negotiable, no matter how little I wanted to go.

My phone buzzed. Gregory's name flashed on the screen.

I answered sharply. "What is it? I'm busy."

"We got a DNA match from the blood sample at Sophia's house."

Her name hit me like a punch to the gut. The cruel words I'd thrown at her still haunted me. I shouldn't have lashed out, but seeing her lay a hand on Isabella had ignited something primal in me.

"And?" I demanded, gripping the phone tighter.

"Not good news." His tone was grim. "The guy's alias was Victor Graves. Professional hitman. We tracked him down—only to find him with a bullet in his skull."

My jaw clenched. Dead ends. Again.

"Any leads on who hired him?"

"Nothing. And the tipster? Probably the killer. They knew we had evidence, so they silenced him before we could get answers."

The implications settled like ice in my veins.

"That means whoever's after Sophia is close to her. Otherwise, how would they know about the blood evidence?"

The media had only reported the attack—no details about forensics.

"Either that, or they've got an inside source feeding them intel," Gregory concluded.

Frustration coiled inside me. Just when I thought we were making progress, the trail went cold.

"Keep me updated," I snapped before hanging up.

I finished dressing, my mood darker than before. The last thing I wanted was to play nice at some charity event.

My limo waited outside. Isabella was my plus-one tonight, so we swung by her penthouse. She looked stunning in emerald silk, but for some reason, the sight didn’t stir me the way it once had.

"You're quiet," she remarked as we rode in silence.

"Just thinking."

"About?"

I didn’t answer. How could I tell her my thoughts were consumed by her sister?

Her lips thinned, but she said nothing, turning to gaze out the window. The tension was suffocating.

When we arrived, cameras flashed instantly.

"Mr. Blackwood! Are you and Isabella Sterling officially a couple now?"

"Is it true you only married Sophia out of obligation?"

"Where is your ex-wife tonight?"

Isabella stiffened beside me, her nails digging into my arm. I steered her past the vultures into the grand ballroom.

The venue was opulent, but my attention snagged the moment Sophia walked in.

She was radiant. Gold silk clung to her curves, her hair cascading in loose waves. At her side, Daniel Carter looked every bit the possessive escort, his hand resting possessively on her bare back.

She passed our table without a glance—except for Amelia, who received a warm smile.

Something ugly twisted in my chest when Daniel kissed her cheek.

"Guess the cop comes from money," Olivia sneered. "But Sophia? Please. She’s hardly gala material."

Amelia scoffed. "Funny, since you wouldn’t be here without Ethan’s wallet. And Isabella? Only his name got you an invite, not yours."

"Amelia—" Nathan growled.

"No. Olivia’s just bitter because she’s a glorified secretary who slept her way up. And Isabella? Nine years, and you’re still throwing tantrums over a mistake. Grow up."

The table erupted. Nathan stood, but Amelia was already storming off—only to be intercepted by security and escorted to Sophia’s table.

Then, shockingly, Olivia was ejected from the gala entirely.

Before we could process it, the hostess took the stage.

"Ladies and gentlemen, it’s my honor to introduce the founder of Hope Foundation…"

The room held its breath.

"Sophia Sterling."

Silence. Then—gasps.

My ex-wife rose gracefully, her smile luminous as the crowd erupted into applause.

And just like that, the woman I’d underestimated for years became the most powerful person in the room.
###Chapter 39
"What?" Isabella whispers beside me, her voice trembling with shock.

The entire room falls into stunned silence. Every face reflects pure astonishment. No one had anticipated this.

No one could have imagined that Sophia—quiet, unassuming Sophia—was the mastermind behind one of the largest charitable organizations in the country.

Hell, I was married to her for years, and I had no damn clue. That says everything about how blind I've been.

"Did you know about this?" Sebastian asks, his eyes wide, mouth slightly agape.

"No," I growl, frustration boiling inside me. How had I missed something so significant about her?

I watch as Sophia pushes back her chair and rises. Daniel stands with her, offering his hand with a warm smile. She places her fingers lightly in his, and he escorts her toward the stage. My jaw tightens when his palm lingers on the bare skin of her back as he helps her up the steps.

Once she reaches the podium, he steps aside. She embraces Elizabeth briefly before taking her place at the microphone.

"Hi," she chuckles nervously, clearing her throat. "For some reason, addressing a room full of rowdy teenagers is easier than speaking to a room full of adults."

A ripple of laughter spreads through the crowd.

She continues, her voice steady now. "Most of you already know me, but for those who don’t—my name is Sophia Sterling. As Elizabeth mentioned, we’re here today to celebrate all of you for your unwavering support of the Hope Foundation."

Her gaze sweeps across the room, commanding attention. "As a teacher, I’ve witnessed heartbreaking realities—children with bruises from abusive homes, kids going hungry because they can’t afford lunch, students wearing tattered clothes because their families can barely survive. And worst of all, children who have no home at all."

The room is utterly silent, every ear tuned to her words.

I’ve never seen the city’s elite so captivated by a speech before.

"Seeing their suffering broke my heart," Sophia continues. "So I started helping—one child at a time. First one boy in my class, then another, and another. Before I knew it, I was supporting dozens. That’s when the idea for the Hope Foundation was born."

She pauses, her eyes shining with emotion. "I wanted to create a safe haven for them—a place where they wouldn’t have to worry about survival. We began with the first Hope House, and by God’s grace, we’ve expanded to every major city in the country."

Pride radiates from her as she gestures to the tables filled with children of all ages. "In four years, we’ve helped thousands of kids. Some have gone on to prestigious universities like Harvard and Princeton. Others are still under our care, from infants to teenagers. We ensure they lack nothing—food, education, even allowances for the older ones."

Her voice softens. "This foundation exists to give them hope—to prove that their past doesn’t define their future. So from the bottom of my heart, thank you. Your support has changed lives."

The room erupts in applause as she steps back. People rise to their feet, clapping until she descends the stage.

Elizabeth takes the microphone. "That concludes tonight’s program. Please, enjoy the rest of your evening."

I stare at Sophia, utterly mesmerized. Who knew there was so much depth beneath her quiet exterior?

"Damn," Nathan mutters beside me, shaking his head. "I never would’ve guessed she founded the largest children’s charity in the country."

His gaze flicks between Sophia and Amelia, who remains seated while Sophia is swarmed by children. One of them—a young man—looks oddly familiar.

"No kidding," Sebastian adds, still slack-jawed.

It’s surreal. Like she had an entire secret life none of us knew about. And I never miss details.

Someone drops into the seat Olivia had vacated. I turn, ready to snap, only to find Elizabeth settling in.

"Don’t mind me," she sighs, pulling out her tablet. "Just exhausted. You’re Sophia’s family, right?"

Nathan nods numbly.

"Perfect." She starts typing without another word.

Isabella leans in. "Isn’t that Jacob Montgomery of Montgomery Tech? What’s he doing with Sophia?"

I follow her gaze to the young man now laughing with Sophia. Of course—that’s why he looked familiar.

Montgomery Tech exploded onto the scene two years ago. At twenty, Jacob became the youngest self-made CEO in the industry. His innovations have made him a formidable name, threatening to dethrone even the most established businessmen.

If I were the jealous type, I’d be worried about him overtaking my spot as the top entrepreneur in the country.

Elizabeth answers without looking up. "Jacob was one of our first beneficiaries. An orphan. Sophia recognized his talent early, encouraged him to start his own company, and funded it when no one else believed in him. Now he’s worth millions. As thanks, he made her the second-largest shareholder in Montgomery Tech."

Another bombshell. We exchange stunned glances.

Isabella scoffs. "So she’s profiting off these kids?"

That’s it. I slam my palm on the table. "Enough with the damn snide remarks."

Heads turn, but I glare them into silence. Isabella looks at me like I’ve lost my mind.

Elizabeth raises an eyebrow. "Where have you been living? Sophia doesn’t need anyone’s money. She was a millionaire long before this foundation."

Nathan frowns. "What?"

Elizabeth shrugs. "She’s private about it, but trust me—she’s loaded. If she wanted, she’d rank among the top five wealthiest women in the country."

I do the math. That would put her net worth in the billions.

"The best part?" Elizabeth continues. "She doesn’t flaunt it. No designer labels, no flashy cars. People underestimate her constantly."

A bitter realization hits me. We underestimated her. Repeatedly.

Even when I offered her that divorce settlement, assuming she’d struggle without me—God, what a fool I was.

Isabella pales. "That’s impossible."

Elizabeth smirks. "Shouldn’t her own family know this?"

Shame burns through me. We were her family. And we treated her like an outsider.

Before I can dwell on it, a commotion erupts.

Sophia is standing toe-to-toe with Penelope Harrington—the self-proclaimed queen of high society.

And from the look on Penelope’s face, this won’t end well.

###Chapter 40

"How dare you?" Sophia's voice trembled with barely contained fury.

Penelope rolled her eyes, as if the entire situation was beneath her. "It's not my fault the little brat wasn't watching where she was going. This is a limited-edition Chanel gown, and she nearly ruined it with her sticky fingers."

The tension between Sophia and Penelope was nothing new. I knew Penelope had tormented Sophia relentlessly in school, and even now, years later, the animosity lingered.

The child in question—no older than five—was hiding behind Sophia, her tiny hands clutching the hem of Sophia's dress. She was adorable, with rosy cheeks, a heart-shaped face, and dark curls cascading down her back.

For a fleeting moment, I imagined a little girl with my storm-gray eyes and Sophia’s rich chestnut hair.

I stiffened.

What the hell was that? Where had that thought come from? Shaking my head, I forced myself to focus on the scene unfolding before me. Sophia was finally standing up to Penelope, and it was glorious.

"Are you serious?" Sophia snapped, her voice sharp. "That’s your excuse for berating a child? Especially when we’re all here for them?"

Penelope huffed, stomping her foot like a spoiled toddler. "It’s not an excuse! I won’t let some orphan who’s never even seen wealth ruin a dress worth more than her entire future!"

Gasps erupted around the room. Penelope paled as she realized the entire crowd had heard her venomous words—and none of them were pleased.

"That’s not what I meant—" she backpedaled frantically.

Sophia cut her off with a chilling smile. "You know what? Leave. If this is how you treat these children, you have no place here." She signaled to one of the security guards stationed nearby.

Penelope’s jaw dropped. "You’re kicking me out?"

Sophia arched a brow. "Obviously."

"You can’t do this! I’ve donated millions to this foundation!"

Sophia’s smirk turned dangerous. She gestured to Elizabeth, who immediately pulled up the records on her tablet.

"One million, to be exact," Elizabeth announced.

Sophia turned back to Penelope, her gaze icy. "What we don’t need is someone like you—someone arrogant enough to think we can’t survive without their money." She nodded at Elizabeth. "Transfer it all back."

The room fell silent.

A moment later, Elizabeth confirmed, "It’s done."

Sophia crossed her arms. "Now that you have your money, get out. And consider yourself banned from every event I or my foundation hosts."

Penelope shrieked curses as the guard dragged her out, her heels scraping against the marble floor.

Just like with Vanessa, this would destroy Penelope’s social standing. And Sophia had orchestrated it flawlessly.

She turned to the crowd, her voice steady and commanding. "Does anyone else share Penelope’s sentiments? Because let me be clear—we are here for these children. And I will remove anyone who disrespects them."

In that moment, she looked like an avenging angel—ready to strike down anyone who dared harm those under her protection.

When no one spoke, Sophia smiled. "Good. Enjoy the rest of the evening."

My gaze locked onto her as she strode toward the balcony. Isabella said something to me, but I barely registered it. All I saw was Sophia.

I stood abruptly, ignoring Isabella’s call as I followed Sophia outside.

She stood at the railing, the wind tousling her hair as she stared at the darkening sky.

Now that I was here, I had no idea what to say. We hadn’t spoken since that day at her house. Every call, every text—ignored.

She tensed as I approached. "What do you want, Ethan?"

I moved closer until I stood beside her. "Why didn’t you tell me?"

"Tell you what?"

"About the Hope Foundation. About the fact that you never needed my money. Why let everyone look down on you?"

She scoffed, turning to face me fully. "When exactly was I supposed to tell you? You barely tolerated my presence. You went out of your way to avoid me."

Her brown eyes held something new—something fierce. And yet, something was missing.

She continued, her voice softer now. "Besides, would you have even cared? You made it clear that nothing about me mattered to you."

She was right. I’d been a cold bastard. I’d convinced myself I didn’t owe her anything—not after what she’d supposedly done to me.

But now? Now I saw the truth.

"About Isabella—" I started, but she cut me off.

"Don’t. I don’t want you, Ethan. Whatever love I had for you is dead. You killed it." She took a steadying breath. "Loving you was my biggest mistake. And I won’t repeat it."

Her words hit like a sledgehammer to the chest.

"But I’ll always be grateful for Liam," she added softly. "He’s the only good thing you ever gave me."

Then she turned, her gaze locking onto Daniel.

"I’m sorry," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "For everything. I was drunk that night. I never meant to come between you and Isabella."

Daniel turned, his lips curving into a smile as he met her eyes.

The sight made my blood boil.

"I’m staying out of your life," Sophia continued, still looking at him. "Don’t come to my house. Don’t call me unless it’s about Liam—and even then, go through our lawyers."

She finally faced me. "Goodbye, Ethan."

She walked away.

My heart screamed for her to stop.

Then she paused. "One last thing. If you want things to work with Isabella, you should ask her for the truth. A relationship built on lies won’t last."

With that, she left.

Daniel met her halfway, taking her hand and leading her into the garden.

I turned away just as he kissed her.

This was what I wanted, wasn’t it? For her to move on. For her to leave me alone.

So why did it feel like I’d just lost everything?
###Chapter 41

My entire body ached, screaming for a hot bath and the sweet oblivion of sleep.

We'd spent weeks preparing for this gala. Originally, I wasn’t even supposed to attend—Elizabeth had always been my public face. But after my emotional breakdown in the kitchen that day, I decided it was time to stop hiding.

When I told Elizabeth I’d be attending, her face lit up like fireworks. For five years, my identity had been a closely guarded secret. Not out of fear, but because I craved simplicity. I didn’t want the spotlight. I didn’t want sycophants suddenly fawning over me just because they’d discovered my wealth.

Now? I was ready. I knew who was genuine and who wasn’t.

Hell, tonight alone, I’d already caught people who’d once sneered at me—men and women who’d treated me like dirt because I didn’t have a high-paying job, because they assumed I was broke—suddenly tripping over themselves to kiss my ass.

It was infuriating. I just wanted to escape them all.

"I still can’t believe you’re the founder of Hope Foundation," Amelia breathed, her voice thick with awe. "Why didn’t you tell me?"

Hours had passed since my confrontation with Ethan. Standing beside him, laying out exactly how things would be from now on, I felt… nothing.

There was something liberating about letting go of the past. I wasn’t fully healed, but the constant ache in my chest had dulled. No anger. No bitterness. No hatred. Just numbness—and I loved it. I could finally breathe without feeling like I was drowning.

"Sophia?"

I turned to Amelia. "Yes?"

"You didn’t answer my question," she pouted.



"I kept it quiet because only Hope Foundation staff, the kids, and Liam knew," I admitted. "I asked them to keep it secret until I was ready."

She nodded, understanding flashing in her eyes. Then she fell silent, her gaze drifting toward Ethan’s table—lingering on Nathan before she forced herself to look away.

Since Ethan was our biggest donor, our tables were close. I’d heard everything—Isabella and Olivia mocking me, Amelia defending me, calling out their petty behavior. When Nathan told her to leave, I couldn’t let that happen. I’d asked Elizabeth to have security bring her to our table instead.

As for Olivia? Well, watching her slink away in humiliation was just a small taste of payback for all the cruelty she’d dished out.

"You can go to him, Amelia. It’s okay," I said, nodding toward Nathan.

He’d been stealing glances at her all night. She hadn’t noticed, but I had.

"I can’t. Not after what he did. He claims he wants your forgiveness, yet he lets Isabella and Olivia trash-talk you?" Her anger simmered just beneath the surface.

"I appreciate you standing up for me, but I don’t need anyone fighting my battles," I said softly. "You love Nathan. I see that. You’re my best friend, Amelia. That means I want you happy. If he makes you happy, I can accept that."

She stared at me, then her eyes widened. "Something’s changed."

"What do you mean?" I fought a smile.

"You’re different. What happened?"

I shrugged. "Maybe I’m just done living in bitterness. Or maybe…" I smirked. "It’s definitely the sex."

"What?" Her jaw dropped comically.



I laughed at her expression.

"You had sex with Daniel?" she repeated, as if her brain couldn’t process it.

"Yes," I purred, remembering. "Multiple times, actually."

"Define 'multiple.' One night? Or…?"

A slow grin spread across my face. "Multiple times a night. For several days."

Her mouth fell open before she grinned like an idiot. "Damn, girl! If that’s what’s putting that smile on your face, keep at it. You deserve mind-blowing sex and happiness."

This was why I loved Amelia. No judgment. Just unwavering support.

I pulled her into a tight hug. "Thank you. For being you."

She stiffened in surprise before hugging me back.

"Now go talk to Nathan," I urged.

This time, she didn’t hesitate. She excused herself just as Daniel returned, sliding into his seat before capturing my lips in a searing kiss.

"You’re addictive," he murmured against my ear.

His warm breath sent a shiver down my spine.

"Daniel…" My voice came out breathless.

"This dress is torture," he growled. "All I can think about is those legs wrapped around me while I bury myself so deep inside you, you’ll feel me for days."

My thighs clenched at the imagery.

I was utterly ruined when it came to Daniel. He’d awakened parts of me I didn’t know existed—my desires, my confidence. With him, I wasn’t afraid to ask for what I wanted.

With Ethan, I’d suppressed my needs, terrified of rejection. But Daniel? He taught me to embrace my hunger.

I was about to ask if we could slip away when my phone rang.



Victoria’s name flashed on the screen, killing the mood instantly.

"I need to take this," I told Daniel.

Recognizing Liam’s calls, he nodded with a smile.

Stepping into the garden, I answered.

"Hey, Mommy!" Liam’s sweet voice melted my heart.

"Hi, baby. How are you?"

"Bored," he grumbled. "How’s the party? I wish I could’ve come."

I’d wanted him there, but after the attack, I couldn’t risk it. The chief had called earlier—the man who’d assaulted me was dead. But that didn’t mean the danger was over.

"It’s amazing. I’ll send pictures," I promised. "Jacob and the others said hi."

Liam adored the kids at Hope House. They’d become like siblings.

"Is Jacob there?" he asked excitedly.

"Yes. I gave him Grandma’s number. He’ll call you soon."

Jacob and Liam had an unbreakable bond, despite the age gap.

"Yes!" he cheered. "I’ve missed him so much!"

"He’s missed you too," I said, smiling.

"Okay, Mommy. Bedtime. Just wanted to hear your voice."

My heart swelled. It was late—Hope House had a strict curfew.

"Goodnight, sweetheart. I love you."

"Love you too!"

The call ended, leaving me blinking back tears. God, I missed him.

Then I felt it—eyes on me.

I turned, but the garden was empty. I’d wandered too far from the hall, into the shadows where no one else lingered.

I quickened my pace.

The sensation of being watched intensified. Then—footsteps. Heavy. Deliberate.

My pulse skyrocketed. I broke into a run. Stupid. So stupid. The chief had warned me.

The footsteps matched my speed. I didn’t dare look back—not in these heels.

Panic clawed at my throat as the presence closed in. The air turned thick with menace.

I pushed harder, bursting into the hall’s golden light.

The suffocating pressure vanished. Gasping, I scanned the area—no one.

Then I collided with someone.

"Sorry," I muttered, steadying myself.

I looked up.

My blood turned to ice.

Isabella.

And the look in her eyes promised violence.
###Chapter 42

I watch as Isabella excuses herself and stands up. Normally, I wouldn’t have paid her any attention, but the fact that she left mere minutes after Sophia did set off alarms in my head.

My instincts screamed at me to follow her. Sophia’s words about Isabella had been gnawing at me, twisting my thoughts into knots. I needed answers—especially after the way Isabella had been acting all evening.

The excitement she’d shown about attending this event had evaporated the moment she realized Sophia was the one hosting it. That Sophia wasn’t the failure she’d assumed.

Everyone else seemed fine—Sebastian had even danced with a few women. Nathan, despite the longing glances he kept throwing at Amelia, appeared content now that she’d joined our table.

But Isabella? She was different.

Slowly, I rise from my seat, ignoring the questioning looks from the others.

Outside, I find Sophia and Isabella standing face to face, locked in a silent battle of wills. They’re so absorbed in each other that neither notices me.

"Do you really think founding the Hope Foundation makes you special?" Isabella sneers.

Sophia exhales, exhaustion lining her voice. "I don’t have the patience for this, Isabella. Move."

Watching them, a sickening realization creeps over me.

I’ve been wrong. So fucking wrong.

"You’re nothing, Sophia," Isabella spits. "No amount of money changes that. We all hate you—especially Ethan."

Sophia doesn’t flinch. "Are you done? Because all I hear is the same garbage you’ve been spewing since you came back." She steps forward, but Isabella grabs her wrist—hard.

I see red.

Sophia yanks her arm free before I can intervene.

"Ethan is mine," Isabella hisses. "Stay away from him. Don’t start thinking you’re his equal now."

Sophia’s expression darkens. "How many times do I have to say it? I don’t want him. You can have him. I don’t fucking care."

Her words hit me like a punch to the gut.

"Liar!" Isabella snaps. "I saw him follow you to the balcony. You ruined us once—I won’t let you do it again."

Sophia scoffs. "Is that why you lied to him? Why you play the victim while painting me as the villain? Did you tell him you were the one who started both fights?"

My hands clench into fists.

I didn’t know that.

Isabella had sworn Sophia attacked her unprovoked. And like a fool, I believed her.

"It doesn’t matter," Isabella says smugly. "Ethan will always choose me over you. He loves me. You mean nothing to him."

I close my eyes, the weight of my mistakes crashing down on me.

How many times had I taken someone else’s word over Sophia’s? How many times had I punished her for lies?

Sophia laughs bitterly. "Pathetic. You claim to love him, yet you manipulate him. What kind of love is that?"

Before Isabella can respond, Sophia adds, "What do you think will happen when Ethan finds out you lied? When he hears what you said about Liam?"

Every muscle in my body locks.

Liam.

If there’s one line no one crosses, it’s involving my son.

"He’ll never know," Isabella says confidently. "Because he’ll believe whatever I tell him. That’s how much he trusts me."

"A trust you’ve broken a thousand times," Sophia fires back. "Ethan is the last person I’d defend, but even he doesn’t deserve to be blindsided by the woman he loves."

She tries to leave, but Isabella grabs her again.

"Let go," Sophia warns, her voice icy. "Or I’ll have security throw you out like I did with Olivia and Penelope."

Enough.

I step out of the shadows. "That won’t be necessary. I’ll handle this."

Both women whip around. Sophia pulls free and walks away without a backward glance. Isabella pales, her eyes wide with panic.

"How long have you been there?" she whispers.

"Long enough," I growl. "Now. Tell me the truth. Lie to me, and I swear you’ll regret it."

She swallows hard.

"Did Sophia slap you two weeks ago?"

"Y-yes."

"Why?"

Silence.

The girl who couldn’t stop running her mouth earlier is now mute.

"Answer me!" I roar.

She flinches. "B-because…"

Tears fill her eyes, but I don’t care.

"Because I told her to keep Liam on a leash," she finally chokes out. "That I wouldn’t let him ruin us… and if I had to, I’d send him away to boarding school."

The world tilts.

I believed her. I defended her. I went to Sophia’s house and screamed at her—all because of Isabella’s lies.

Now I understand why Sophia hit her.

She was protecting Liam. Just like I would.

The woman in front of me isn’t the kind, gentle girl I fell in love with. She’s vindictive. Cruel.

"We’re done," I say coldly.

"W-what?"

"The only reason I’m not making you pay is out of respect for our past. But no one—no one—threatens my son."

"Please, Ethan!" She grabs for me, sobbing. "This was our second chance!"

I push her away gently. "Maybe. Maybe not."

I walk away, her cries fading behind me.

This time, her tears don’t move me.

Because my head is a mess.

I can’t claim to love her when my ex-wife consumes my thoughts. When the idea of Sophia with someone else drives me insane.

I thought I felt nothing for Sophia.

But what if I’ve been wrong all along?

###Chapter 43

Saturday morning dawned bright and clear, the aftermath of last night's successful dinner party still lingering in my mind. Despite the chaos, everything had gone perfectly.

I slipped out of bed and headed to the bathroom, running through my morning routine. Daniel had come home with me, but he hadn’t stayed the night—he had an early shift and didn’t want to wake me when he left.

As I brushed my teeth, my thoughts drifted back to yesterday.

When Isabella had cornered me, I’d been ready for a fight. I knew the exact moment Ethan stepped outside and found us in a heated standoff.

It was strange how I could sense his presence when she couldn’t. I’d wanted to expose her lies, to make Ethan see the kind of woman he’d been so blindly devoted to.

Every word I’d said to her had been deliberate. It was time for him to wake up.

Everyone saw Isabella as perfect—incapable of wrongdoing. Maybe that had been true once, but not anymore.

Losing Ethan years ago might have changed her. Or maybe her career as a lawyer had hardened her. Whatever the reason, she wasn’t the same person.

After my shower, I dressed in my usual jeans, t-shirt, and flats before heading downstairs to make breakfast. I had a meeting with Elizabeth at Hope House at nine—standard procedure after an event.

My phone buzzed mid-bite, pulling me from my thoughts.

Morning, gorgeous.

A smile tugged at my lips. Daniel had a way of making me feel wanted—something Ethan had never managed.

Morning, I replied, adding a heart emoji.

What’s your day looking like?

Just stopping by Hope House, then meeting Amelia later.

Sounds good. Miss you already.

I smirked, typing back. Really? Miss me, or miss something else?

The boldness sent a thrill through me. I’d never been this forward before.

Both. Fuck, just thinking about you has me hard.

Is that so?

I loved knowing I had that effect on him. With Ethan, I’d always wondered if he was imagining Isabella instead.

YES. And it’s embarrassing because I’m in a squad car. Pretty sure my partner noticed.

I laughed, warmth spreading through me. Daniel made me feel cherished—unlike Ethan, who’d made me feel like an afterthought.

Poor baby. Maybe I can help later.

You sure? I wasn’t exactly gentle last night.

I sent a wink emoji. I’ll survive.

His reply came minutes later. Guess I’ll have to try harder. Next time, you’ll feel every thrust for days.

Finishing breakfast, I left the dishes in the sink, promising myself I’d wash them later.

You’d better.

When he didn’t respond, I grabbed my keys and headed out, giddiness bubbling in my chest. For the first time in forever, life felt right.

Hope House was a masterpiece—sleek, modern, and designed to feel like home. The sprawling estate boasted floor-to-ceiling windows, lush gardens, and every amenity imaginable.

Inside, the kids greeted me with hugs.

"Sophia!" they chorused.

I smiled. "Anyone seen Elizabeth?"

Hannah, a seventeen-year-old who’d been with us since her pregnancy at fifteen, pointed toward the office. "She’s in there."

I thanked her and headed in, finding Elizabeth flipping through a magazine.

She grinned. "You’re everywhere."

The cover featured me at last night’s gala, the headline blaring: Sophia Sterling Revealed as Founder of Hope Foundation—The Nation’s Leading Children’s Charity.

I rolled my eyes. "Don’t care. Let’s focus on work."

She handed me the reports. "Donations doubled overnight."

My breath caught at one line. "Ethan donated ten million?"

She nodded. "His biggest single donation yet."

Before I could process that, my phone buzzed—Daniel apologizing for the delay.

Then Elizabeth gasped, her face paling.

"What’s wrong?" I demanded.

She swallowed hard. "Your house—it’s been set on fire."
###Chapter 44

"You're joking, right?" My voice trembles as I search her face for any sign this is some cruel prank.

Elizabeth shakes her head, her expression somber, before handing me her phone.

"SOPHIA STERLING'S HOME DESTROYED IN FIRE HOURS AFTER REVEALING HOPE FOUNDATION LEADERSHIP."

I read the headline three times, my fingers tightening around the device. The words blur as I scroll down to the video—flames engulfing the familiar structure, smoke billowing into the sky.

My stomach lurches. No matter how much I deny it, the truth is undeniable. That was my home.

Heart pounding, I shove the phone back at her and bolt from the room, my movements frantic.

"Sophia, wait!" Elizabeth calls after me, but I don’t stop.

The world blurs as I race through the building, my pulse roaring in my ears. I barely register the faces around me as I burst outside.

Slamming into my car, I peel out of the parking lot just as Elizabeth reaches the doors. She waves frantically, shouting something I don’t hear. I don’t care.

My mind is chaos—rage and terror warring inside me.

Did I leave the stove on? I can’t remember. The uncertainty claws at me.

My phone buzzes—Ethan Blackwood’s name flashes on the screen. I ignore it. I can’t deal with him right now.

More calls follow—Daniel, Amelia, even Nathan and Victoria. I silence them all. Right now, I just need to see the damage for myself.

"Watch it, bitch!" A man yells, flipping me off as I swerve to avoid hitting him.

"Sorry!" I shout, but he keeps cursing. I don’t have time for this.

Twenty minutes later, I pull into my neighborhood.

The scene is chaos—police cars, firefighters, bystanders. I park and walk numbly toward the wreckage.

My breath catches. The flames still lick at the structure, though the firefighters are making progress. But it’s too late. There’s nothing left to save.

Tears sting my eyes. That house wasn’t just walls—it was home. Liam’s and mine. Every memory we’d built there was now ash.

Why is this happening? Haven’t I suffered enough?

"Sophia."

Ethan’s voice cuts through the haze. I turn to find him behind me, his expression unreadable.

"What are you doing here?" I wipe my face roughly.

At least no other homes were damaged. That’s the only silver lining.

"You weren’t answering your phone. I was worried." He steps closer.

I want to collapse into his arms, but I know better. That comfort isn’t mine anymore.

"I’m fine," I lie, turning away. There’s nothing left to do here.

I quicken my pace when I hear him following. I need to figure out where I’m staying tonight.

Sliding into my car, I think I’ve lost him—until the passenger door opens and he drops into the seat.

"What the hell?" I snap.

"You’re not driving alone like this." He buckles his seatbelt, jaw set.

"Get out."

He doesn’t move.

"Ethan, I swear to God—"

"Drive or we sit here all night. Your choice."

We glare at each other. Finally, I give in.

"What about your car?"

"Arthur can handle it."

I start the engine.

"Home," I whisper bitterly. "I don’t have one anymore."

"It’ll be okay."

"Will it?" My voice cracks.

Something tells me this is just the beginning.

I call my realtor, who answers immediately.

"Sophia, I’m so sorry—"

"I need a place. Now."

"I have one perfect for you."

Relief floods me. "Send the address."

As I hang up, Ethan speaks.

"You know I have properties you could use."

"No thanks. I don’t need your charity."

He mutters something under his breath.

Silence stretches between us, thick and uncomfortable.

"How’d you get so wealthy?" he asks suddenly. "Last I checked, your father cut you off."

I almost ignore him, but I realize what he’s doing—distracting me.

"I knew our marriage wouldn’t last," I admit. "I didn’t want a dime from you except for Liam. So I invested my savings into a startup—Tom’s Logistics. Everyone said I’d fail."

I smile faintly. "They were wrong."

His brows lift slightly.

"And after that?"

"I invested in other startups. Never lost money."

He looks impressed.

"I wanted to tell you when I made my first million," I continue, voice hollow. "But you made it clear you didn’t care."

The memory stings. The way he’d looked at me—like I was nothing.

Ethan swallows hard. "Sophia—"

"Save it."

The silence is suffocating.

His phone rings, breaking the tension.

"Gregory wants to see us at the station," he says after hanging up.

"Why?"

"About the fire. Now."

I turn the car around without another word.

The chief’s office is grim.

"Arson," Gregory says bluntly.

My blood runs cold.

"Someone tried to kill you, Sophia."

The words don’t fully register.

If I hadn’t met Elizabeth this morning… I’d be dead.

The realization hits like a punch.

How long can I keep escaping death before it catches me?
###Chapter 45

The furniture store was overwhelming, but my mind was elsewhere.

I had just bought a new house—a perfect little haven that suited my style. Simple, cozy, and in a great neighborhood. Best of all, it was closer to Liam’s school. The moment I saw the big backyard, I knew it was the one.

"Are you even listening to me?" Amelia huffed, arms crossed.

She had been helping me pick out furniture for the past three days, and yet my new place was still empty. I didn’t even have a bed—just a makeshift setup on the floor.

"Sorry," I sighed. "I’ve got too much on my mind."

When someone’s trying to kill you, everything else fades into the background. Survival becomes the only priority—staying alive long enough to watch your child grow up.

The memory of the fire sent chills down my spine. Someone had set my house ablaze, wanting me to burn alive. What kind of monster does that?

And it wasn’t a coincidence. First, the chase after the dinner party. Then, the fire the next day.

"Is this about your house?" Amelia asked softly.

My hands clenched into fists. "Yes. And everything else. Four times, Amelia. Four times they’ve tried to kill me, and they won’t stop until I’m dead. I just want to be left the hell alone."

A few shoppers turned to stare, but I didn’t care.

I felt lost. Liam was safe, but I missed him desperately. Weeks had passed since I last held him.

"What if they succeed?" My voice cracked. "I haven’t seen Liam in three months. Video calls aren’t the same. What if I never get to hold him again?"

Amelia shifted awkwardly. "Uh… I don’t know what to say."

I wiped my eyes, laughing weakly. "You’re terrible at pep talks."

"Hell no!" She groaned. "Look, I don’t know how you feel, but don’t let them win. The second you break, they’ve got power over you."

She was right. Losing control was exactly what they wanted.

"Thanks, Amelia." I hugged her.

"Good. Now, are we done here? I’m starving."

We headed to a nearby diner, ordering burgers, fries, and milkshakes. For a moment, I forgot the danger.

Amelia groaned, rubbing her stomach. "I’m so full I can’t think straight."

"You look like you just had an orgasm," I teased.

She smirked. "I did. A food orgasm."

I gagged. "Do not finish that sentence."

My phone buzzed—a message from Daniel.

"I have to go. Daniel’s coming to help move the furniture."

We paid and left.

I didn’t see them until it was too late.

"Seriously?" Isabella’s voice cut through the air.

She stood beside Nathan in the parking lot, glaring like she wanted to murder me.

I tried to walk past, but her words stopped me.

"Are you happy now?" Her voice dripped with venom.

I turned. "Happy about what?"

"Don’t play dumb! Ethan broke things off with me. This was your plan all along, wasn’t it?"

I blinked. I hadn’t expected that.

"It doesn’t concern me," I said flatly.

"Liar!" she shrieked.

I looked at Nathan. "Control your sister before she does something stupid."

"You’re my sister too, Sophia," he murmured.

"Not for a long time."

Isabella stepped forward. "If you think you’ve won, you’re wrong. Ethan is mine. I’ll destroy anyone who tries to take him from me."

I scoffed. "Ethan isn’t property. Have him. Marry him. Just understand—I. Don’t. Want. Him."

"You expect me to believe that? You were obsessed with him!"

"And now it’s you." I turned to leave.

"You walk away, and I’ll make that bastard son of yours pay."

The world froze.

I moved before I thought.

I slammed her against a van, forearm crushing her throat.

The self-defense classes had paid off. And now, I had a gun.

I pressed it to her temple.

"Threaten Liam again, and I’ll bury you where no one will find you."

"Sophia, stop!" Nathan begged.

"If you so much as look at him wrong, I’ll destroy you," I hissed. "Am I understood?"

She nodded, trembling.

I released her.

Nathan rushed to her side. "How could you do this?"

"She’s not my sister," I spat. "Keep her away from me. Or I’ll burn everything down to protect my son."

Nathan looked shattered, but I didn’t care.

I turned to Isabella. "Ask yourself—are you still the woman Ethan fell for? Or have you become someone he could never love?"

Then I walked away, praying she’d realize what she’d become—before it was too late.
###Chapter 46

The moment I pulled into the driveway of my new house, my anger still simmered beneath the surface. Calling this place "home" would take some getting used to.

I stepped out of the truck and froze.

Ethan Blackwood—of all people—was lounging on my front porch.

I marched toward him, my glare sharp enough to cut glass.

"If you're here to lecture me about Isabella, turn your ass around and leave," I snapped, jabbing a finger at his sleek black Aston Martin.

If he thought he could come here and start trouble, I’d send him flying into orbit.

His brows furrowed. "What the hell are you talking about?"

"That conniving bitch must’ve called you with some sob story, didn’t she?" I hissed, my blood boiling just remembering her words.

I tapped my foot impatiently, waiting for confirmation. Why else would he show up right after my fight with Isabella?

"I have no damn clue what you’re ranting about," he growled, dragging a hand through his hair. "I’m not here for whatever drama went down between you two."

"Then why are you here?"

"Nathan called. Said you might need help moving furniture." He took a step forward, and I instinctively retreated.

At the mention of my brother’s name, my fury reignited. Those two were unbelievable. Sometimes I questioned how I was even related to them.

"Don’t you dare say his name to me," I spat.

He’d known Liam since birth. How could he just stand there while Isabella threatened him? And then have the audacity to scold me for reacting?

"What did he do?"

"He stood there like a damn statue while Isabella threatened Liam, then had the nerve to lecture me when I nearly put her through a wall."

I braced for his usual explosion, for him to take her side.

But he didn’t.

Instead, his voice dropped to something lethal. "She did what?"

The air crackled with tension. I swore the ground trembled beneath his rage.

I swallowed hard. This wasn’t the reaction I’d expected.

"I walked away to avoid a fight. Then she stopped me, saying she’d make Liam pay for ‘stealing’ you from her."

His eyes darkened, a storm brewing in their depths. "If she so much as looks at him wrong, it’ll be the last thing she ever does."

The threat wasn’t empty. The murderous glint in his eyes confirmed that.

"Calm down," I said cautiously. "After the warning I gave her, she won’t dare go near him."

I’d seen the fear in her eyes. She knew she’d crossed a line—one that would cost her.

Our sisterly bond had died long ago. She knew I wouldn’t hesitate to destroy her if she hurt my son.

Ethan struggled to rein in his temper, his jaw clenched so tight I thought it might crack.

Before I could say more, his gaze snapped over my shoulder. The fury in his eyes multiplied tenfold as a car door slammed behind me.

I sighed. Daniel.

Daniel despised Ethan, and judging by Ethan’s expression, the feeling was mutual.

"What’s he doing here?" they snarled in unison.

I stepped between them, watching as they squared off like two wolves ready to tear each other apart.

"Since you’re both here to help, let’s get this over with," I said, turning toward the truck before they could argue.

Unlocking it, I glanced back. Neither had moved.

"Are you two done with your pissing contest? We have work to do."

Ethan grunted and stomped forward. Daniel followed, his expression just as sour.

They worked in tense silence, carrying heavy furniture while shooting daggers at each other.

Then—crash.

I rushed inside to find them brawling on the floor like teenagers.

"Stay the hell away from her!" Ethan roared, landing a punch.

"Like hell I will!" Daniel shot back, striking Ethan’s ribs.

"STOP!" I shrieked.

They ignored me.

Grabbing a bowl of water, I dumped it over their heads.

They froze, blinking up at me like I was the crazy one.

"What the hell is wrong with you two?" I screamed.

"He started it," Daniel muttered like a petulant child.

"I don’t care who started it!" I turned to Ethan. "What’s your damn problem?"

His glare could’ve melted steel. "My problem is you dating this bastard!"

I gaped at him. Since when did he care who I dated?

"That’s none of your business. Shouldn’t you be happy he’s keeping me occupied so I’m not ‘bothering’ you?"

"If it were anyone else, I wouldn’t give a damn. But him?" He scoffed. "Wake the hell up, Sophia."

"Stop insulting him!"

"Why can’t you see he’s using you? Are you so desperate for love that you’ll ignore the truth staring you in the face?"

His words sliced through me like glass.

"Get out," I seethed. "I won’t let you disrespect me or him."

His glare turned deadly. "Fine. But mark my words—he will hurt you. And when he does, you’ll have no one to blame but yourself."

With that, he stormed out, slamming the door behind him.

Ethan was wrong.

Daniel would never hurt me.

Unlike Ethan, he actually cared.
###Chapter 47

"What the hell happened to you?" Sebastian asks, eyeing the ice pack pressed against my jaw.

"Daniel," I grunt, not in the mood for my brother's interrogation.

Fuck. I still can't believe I let that bastard get under my skin. But his words—his fucking arrogance—had been the last straw.

"The cop?" Sebastian raises a brow. "Sophia's new guy?"

At that, I snap. I hurl the ice pack across the room, watching it shatter against the wall.

"He's not her fucking guy," I snarl, surging to my feet.

My emotions are raw, too close to the surface. How can Sophia not see through him? The man reeks of deception.

I've dug into his background, but everything checks out—on paper. Yet my gut screams that something's off. He's hiding something. And my instincts have never been wrong.

"From what I hear, he is," Sebastian muses. "So what happened?"

I drag in a breath, trying to smother the fire in my veins.

"We were helping Sophia move into her new place. He told me to back off. Said she was his and he wouldn't let me ruin things."

Sebastian stares at me like I've lost my mind.

"Seriously? That's what set you off?"

"Yes!"

He sighs, dropping onto the couch. "In case you forgot, she's not your wife anymore. And if they're dating, he has every right to ask you to step back. Sound familiar? Wasn’t that exactly what you demanded of Sophia when you started seeing Isabella?"

I clench my fists. Why does no one else see it?

"This isn’t about that," I seethe. "There’s something wrong with him. Why can’t you see it?"

I pace my office, fury boiling beneath my skin. First, I find out Isabella threatened Liam and Nathan did nothing. Then I have to watch Sophia and Daniel making heart eyes at each other like lovesick fools.

She’s completely under his spell. The woman who questions everything just let him waltz into her life without a second thought.

"What are you talking about?" Sebastian asks, watching me closely.

I can’t stop moving. Sitting still is impossible with this storm inside me.

"I can’t explain it, but I don’t trust him. Something’s off."

It makes no logical sense, but I can’t shake the feeling. That’s why I’ve got my investigator digging deeper.

Sebastian stays silent for a long moment before speaking again—and I nearly punch him for it.

"Could it be you’re just jealous?"

"Fuck no," I roar. "Why the hell would I be jealous? I don’t have feelings for Sophia. Remember?"

The idea is absurd. Jealousy has nothing to do with this. She’s Liam’s mother, and I’m protecting him. That’s all.

"Look, you were married to her for nine years. It’s hard to spend that much time with someone and not feel something. Especially someone who isn’t actually a monster."

I stare at him, stunned, before shaking my head. "There’s no way. I stayed with her for Liam. My heart has always belonged to Isabella, and you know that. That’s why I never let myself feel anything for Sophia."

He’s lost his damn mind. People stay in loveless marriages all the time. Nine years didn’t change the fact that I never wanted her—not after what she did to trap me.

"Then explain why you care so much about her dating Daniel," he presses.

"I already told you! I wouldn’t give a damn if it were anyone else, but that cop is shady as hell."

We’re going in circles, and it’s only fueling my rage. I thought Sebastian, of all people, would understand. Instead, he’s spinning this into some delusion that I’m secretly pining for Sophia.

"I’ll admit what Sophia did nine years ago was wrong. We treated her like shit for it. But what if she wasn’t lying about being drunk? What if she was telling the truth?"

"Impossible."

"Is it? We all wanted you with Isabella—everyone except Sophia. After that night, we needed someone to blame. It was easier to vilify the girl who’d been obsessed with you for years than admit you both screwed up."

I freeze, staring at him. What the hell has gotten into him?

He pulls out his phone and dials a number.

"What are you doing?" I demand.

"Something we should’ve done a long time ago. I’m getting the truth about that night."

We wait in tense silence until someone answers. Sebastian orders footage from the bar and the hotel, demanding it within the hour.

After he hangs up, I scoff. "What’s the point of dredging this up? We know what happened."

"Besides the truth? Clarity. I think you’ve felt something for Sophia for years. Your anger over what you think was her betrayal has blinded you." His gray eyes—so like mine—lock onto me, daring me to argue.

I turn away, dropping into my chair. I won’t let him see how much this rattles me.

We sit in silence until his phone pings. His face shifts from shock to horror.

"Sebastian?" I say cautiously.

He looks up, haunted, and hands me his phone. My hands shake as I take it, already dreading what I’ll see.

The video plays. The truth I’ve clung to for nine years crumbles before my eyes.

Sophia had been telling the truth. We were both drunk.

For nearly a decade, she’s carried the blame for something that wasn’t her fault.

"Fuck!" I shout, the weight of it crushing me.
###Chapter 48

The walls of my penthouse feel like they're closing in on me. I can't sit still. I've tried calling that bastard Julian Cross a dozen times, but he's gone completely silent.

Ever since he torched Sophia's house, he's been a ghost. That's what terrifies me the most—not knowing what he's planning.

If I don't know his next move, I can't counter it. Not like I did with Victor Graves.

I snatch my phone and dial Dominic.

"Boss?" He answers instantly.

"Any sign of him?" My voice is tight.

I don't panic. I don't get anxious. But right now, my gut is screaming that something is about to go very, very wrong.

A cold dread coils in my chest, refusing to let go.

"Nothing. It's like he vanished." Dominic's voice is tense. "No one's seen him in days."

When I found out Victor had been caught, I knew I had to act fast.

The cops would’ve broken him eventually. So I put a bullet in his skull before he could lead them back to me.

Turns out, I was right. The police were closing in. But I got to him first.

Men like him? They don’t have loyalty. He would’ve sold me out in a heartbeat to save himself.

I couldn’t let that happen. Not after everything I’ve built.

Victor died. The cops lost their lead. And I hired Julian Cross.

"Boss." Dominic’s voice snaps me back.

"What?" My mind races.

This isn’t like me. But something feels off. Like the ground is about to crumble beneath me.

"I said we’ll keep looking. We’ll find him."

I grit my teeth. "Find him. Now."

I hang up and resume pacing. Restless. Agitated.

This wasn’t the plan. Things were supposed to be under control. But now? Now I feel like time’s running out.

"Damn it!" My fist slams into the wall.

I can feel it. Everything I’ve done—every secret, every lie—is about to unravel.

And I don’t know if I’m ready for what comes next.

I grab my phone again and dial the only person who ever calms me down.

"Hi, Mom." I sink onto the couch, forcing my voice steady.

"Sweetheart!" Her voice lights up. "I’ve missed you so much."

Just hearing her makes the tension drain from my body.

"Missed you too," I murmur, suddenly feeling like a kid again.

All the fear fades, just for a moment.

"Not that I’m not thrilled, but why the call? Shouldn’t you be working?"

How do I tell her I needed to hear her voice one last time before everything falls apart?

"Just wanted to check in," I say roughly.

"Are you okay?" Concern laces her words.

I smile faintly at the old nickname. "Just work stress. Nothing serious."

"You need a break. Take a vacation. You’ve earned it."

Pots clatter in the background. Baking, no doubt.

"I will when things settle," I lie.

With the storm coming, I doubt I’ll ever get that break.

"At least take a weekend. Clear your head."

She’s right. If I can’t track Julian down, maybe I need to step back.

"Thanks, Mom." My throat tightens. "I needed that."

"I love you, sweetheart."

"Love you too."

An incoming call flashes—Dominic.

"Gotta go, Mom. Say hi to everyone."

"Don’t be a stranger."

I hang up and answer immediately.

"Talk." All softness is gone.

Silence. Then—

"We found him. He has Sophia."

The air leaves my lungs.

I grab my gun. "Send me the location."

It’s time to end this.

Evelyn M.M

The villain’s mask slips… Who do you think it is? Drop your guesses below!
###Chapter 49

Two months have passed since my house was reduced to ashes.

For weeks, nothing happened. No threats. No attacks. Just eerie silence.

I started to believe the bastard had given up.

Chief Daniel warned me not to let my guard down. "People like this don’t quit," he said. "They wait. They plan. They strike when you least expect it."

I understood his logic, but hope crept in anyway. When danger fades, so does vigilance.

These past months? The best of my life.

Not as perfect as my moments with Liam, but close.

Because of Daniel.

Every second with him revealed something new about myself.

I love his presence. If I’m honest? I’ve fallen for him.

He’s everything Ethan Blackwood never was—kind, attentive, passionate. And the way he looks at me? It makes my heart race.

I could build a future with him. If he wants me.

Some might say it’s too soon.

But nine years wasted on a man who despised me? I’m seizing happiness now. No regrets.

My phone rings, shattering the daydream.

"Where the hell are you?" Amelia’s voice screeches through the speaker.

Our weekly meetup. I’m late. Blame Daniel and his talented mouth.

"Relax. Just parking," I say, rolling my eyes.

Amelia hates tardiness—ironic, since she’s late 80% of the time.

"Fine!" She huffs and hangs up.

Inside the club’s VIP section, I spot her instantly.

Tonight’s different. No quiet dinners. She wanted to unwind, and I agreed.

My clubbing experience? Zero. My drinking history? Twice.

Once with Ethan Blackwood. Once with Daniel.

Funny how alcohol played a role in both.

"Finally," Amelia drawls as I slide into the booth.

"Got distracted," I smirk.

She grins, understanding without details.

"Cheers to that!" She downs her drink, already tipsy.

The bartender brings my cocktail. One sip, and my eyes widen.

"Told you," she smirks.

"Damn right," I admit. Sweet, not bitter—just how I like it.

"How’s life?" I ask.

"Chaotic," she sighs. "Need extra limbs and a new brain."

I laugh. "Can’t help with that."

"Heard from Ethan?"

Silence.

Since their fight, he’s ghosted me—even about Liam. Calls ignored. Texts answered by his lawyer.

I should be relieved. I asked for this.

But it feels... wrong.

"He’s respecting my wishes," I mutter.

"Doubt it," Amelia murmurs, gaze distant.

"You know something?"

"Just a hunch."

I shake it off. "Tonight’s for fun. No drama."

"Agreed." She checks her phone. "Bathroom break. Back soon."

She vanishes before I can respond.

Five minutes pass. Then ten.

Panic sets in.

The bathroom’s empty.

"Did you see my friend?" I ask the bartender.

"She left through the back," he says.

Why? Her purse and phone are still here.

I rush outside, scanning the alley.

A sharp pain explodes at the back of my skull.

Darkness.

Consciousness returns in fragments.

Blurry vision. Throbbing head.

Then, the horror sinks in.

My wrists are bound. Chains suspend me from the ceiling.

"Struggling’s pointless," a gruff voice says.

A man steps into view—late 30s, thinning blonde hair, cold amber eyes.

"Who are you?" My voice trembles.

"Irrelevant. You know why you’re here."

My blood runs cold.

"Please," I beg. "I have a son."

Tears fall at the thought of leaving Liam.

"Sorry, sweetheart. Big payout for your head."

"I’ll pay more!"

"Not about money," he sneers. "I finish what I start."

His knife grazes my cheek.

"Pretty. But not worth my reputation."

The warehouse door creaks open.

Hope flares—until his voice shatters it.

"Boss. Mission accomplished."

Betrayal crushes me.

The last person I’d ever suspect.

How didn’t I see this coming?

###Chapter 50

I'm a goddamn coward. Plain and simple. Two fucking months, and I still can't bring myself to face Sophia—or even speak to her.

What was I supposed to say? How could I explain to the woman I accused of deceiving me when it turned out she was innocent all along?

Shame burns through me. Shame for everything I did to her. Shame for letting her shoulder the blame. Shame for standing by while everyone treated her like trash because I believed she deserved it.

I don’t know how to face her. How to look into her eyes and apologize. Hell, I don’t even know how to apologize to anyone—because I’ve never been wrong before. I’m always fucking right. Except when it comes to Sophia.

I take a sharp sip of whiskey, trying to drown the guilt. It doesn’t work. But for a few minutes, I can pretend my entire world wasn’t shattered by the truth.

"Sir, Mr. Sterling is here to see you. He seems... distressed," Rosalind, my housekeeper, interrupts.

"Let him in," I mutter, turning away.

When the truth came out, Sebastian couldn’t keep quiet any longer. He shared the video with everyone. Now both families know Sophia wasn’t lying when she said she was drunk that night.

Everyone felt guilty—except Isabella. She clung to her grudge, insisting it didn’t excuse Sophia "going after a man who wasn’t hers."

My relationship with Isabella hasn’t improved. She keeps pushing, but for some reason, I can’t bring myself to give in.

I don’t know what the hell is wrong with me. I wanted a future with her. Yet here I am, pushing her away for reasons I can’t even name.

The door opens, and Nathan storms in.

"What’s going on?" I ask, immediately noticing the panic in his expression.

"I don’t know, but I need your help." He rakes a hand through his hair. "I’m freaking the hell out."

I stand, rounding my desk. I grab a glass, pour whiskey, and shove it into his hands.

"Breathe. Then tell me what happened."

He downs the drink in one gulp. "Sophia called me out of nowhere. Before she could say anything, I heard a scream—then nothing. I tried calling back, but no answer. I called Amelia—they were supposed to be together—but I can’t reach her either. It’s been two hours, and neither of them is picking up."

My body tenses. Sophia would never willingly call Nathan. Something’s wrong.

"Do you know where they went?" I’m already pulling out my phone.

"No. Amelia didn’t tell me."

Maxwell answers on the first ring. "Track Sophia’s car. Now."

"On it."

I had a tracker installed on her car without her knowledge. After she demanded I withdraw her security detail, it was the only way to keep her safe.

Seconds later, the location pings back—near one of my clubs.

"Let’s go," I snap at Nathan.

We arrive in minutes. The bouncers let us through without question. A bartender—Samuel—recognizes them from the photo I show him and leads us to their private booth.

"Both their purses are here. So is Amelia’s phone," Nathan says, rifling through her bag.

"Did you see them leave?" I demand.

Samuel shakes his head. "They came in, ordered drinks, talked for a while. The brunette left for the bathroom, then went outside. The other girl followed. Neither came back."

Rage coils in my gut.

"You didn’t think to check on them?" I slam him against the wall.

He yelps. "I—I didn’t notice! It’s been packed tonight!"

"What the hell is happening here?" Theodore, my manager, strides over.

"What kind of idiots do you hire?" I snarl.

Theodore pales when he recognizes me. "M-Mr. Blackwood?"

"Explain it to him, Nathan. Because if I do, I’ll kill someone."

While Nathan fills him in, I storm to the back exit. The alley is empty—no sign of them. Then my shoe kicks something.

Sophia’s phone.

Nathan rushes out with a tablet. "You need to see this."

The security footage shows Sophia stepping outside—before a man strikes her unconscious and drags her into a waiting car.

Kidnapped.

But where the hell is Amelia?

"At least we have the bastard’s face and license plate," Nathan says.

I ignore him and dial Sebastian.

"Find someone for me." I send him the video.

Hold on, Sophia. I’m coming.
###Chapter 51

I can't move. My heart hammers violently against my ribs. How did I not see this coming? How could I have been so blind?

I'm paralyzed. Humiliated. Words fail me completely. My entire world is collapsing around me, shattering into irreparable fragments.

'Boss.'

That single word echoes relentlessly in my skull, pushing me to the edge of insanity and back. All this time—wondering, guessing, searching—and my enemy was right in front of me the whole damn time.

"What the hell is happening?" The furious shout yanks me back to this nightmare.

I twist around, and my breath catches.

Amelia is tied to a chair, blood trickling from a wound on her forehead. Fear and rage war in her eyes. The bastard who took us must have knocked her out too.

I'd been so consumed by my own terror, so desperate to escape, that I hadn’t even noticed her behind me. Not that I expected anyone to be there.

"Isn’t it obvious?" Our kidnapper smirks. "I took you both."

"Why drag her into this when I’m the one you wanted?" I mutter, staring at the floor.

I can’t bring myself to look at my betrayer. The pain is too raw, too suffocating.

"Wasn’t part of the plan," he admits with a careless shrug. "But then I saw her outside, enjoying the evening air. She’s connected to your family. Figured I could squeeze more ransom money out of them if I kept her."

It makes twisted sense. Amelia is Nathan’s girlfriend, and from what I know, he’s obsessed with her. He’d pay anything to get her back.

"I don’t understand," Amelia rasps. "Why is Daniel here? Is he… here to save us?" Hope flickers in her voice.

His name is a knife to my chest.

Why me?

I thought I’d finally found someone good. That my life was finally falling into place. But this? This betrayal is beyond anything I could’ve imagined.

Amelia presses again.

Our captor laughs—a cruel, mocking sound—and answers for him. Because I sure as hell can’t.

"Save you?" He barks another laugh. "He’s the one who hired me to kill Sophia!"

Amelia gasps. I squeeze my eyes shut as agony rips through me.

Hearing it out loud is so much worse than just suspecting it.

I’d hoped—prayed—there was some explanation. That maybe he had a secret twin. A doppelgänger. But his silence confirms everything.

I slump against the chains binding me. They’re the only thing keeping me upright.

How do I survive this kind of betrayal? How do I look him in the eye knowing he wanted me dead?

Were the last few months just a game to him? Toying with my emotions while plotting the perfect way to end me?

"That’s impossible," Amelia argues, voice trembling. "Daniel is one of the good guys."

I don’t want to believe it either. But the truth is staring us in the face.

Daniel played me for months. Got inside my head. My heart. All while knowing he’d never stay.

It hurts. Worse than anything I’ve ever felt. Worse than what Ethan did.

Couldn’t he have just killed me without getting close? Without making me fall for him? That would’ve been kinder than this.

This is cruelty.

How twisted do you have to be to make your target love you? He slept with me. Listened to my fears. Made me hope for a future he knew would never happen.

"Now that you’re here, Boss," the man grins, offering Daniel a knife. "Want the honors, or should I?"

I finally look at him.

But he’s not looking at me.

My breath hitches when he takes the blade.

"Why?" The word tears from my throat. "Just tell me why. Why make me care if you were just using me? Why sleep with me? Why, Daniel?"

Tears stream down my face. His eyes are ice. No warmth. No remorse.

I feel like discarded trash. Beaten. Broken.

It hurts to look at those blue eyes—the ones that hypnotized me from the moment he showed up at my door after I was shot.

Was that staged too?

The possibility guts me. That he orchestrated everything to play the hero, just so I’d trust him.

"You don’t owe her answers, Boss," the man sneers. "She’s dead either way."

I bet they laughed at me. Mocked how easily I fell for it.

Amelia screams when Daniel pulls a gun and shoots the bastard point-blank. Blood sprays across me, but I don’t flinch.

Then he turns the gun on me.

"Daniel, please," Amelia begs. "This is Sophia! You care about her—I know you do. Whatever started this, things changed. You can’t fake the way you looked at her!"

I’m too exhausted to care.

"Do it," I snarl.

"Sophia, stop!" Amelia shrieks.

But I ignore her.

Daniel doesn’t move. Just stares at me with empty eyes.

All the emotion I used to see there? Gone.

"Fucking do it, Daniel!" I scream as tears fall.

I watch, heart shattering, as his finger tenses on the trigger.

I want him to end it. Because death would hurt less than this.

I close my eyes—

A gunshot rings out.

Evelyn M.M

How many of you guessed Daniel’s betrayal? Did anyone doubt Amelia’s loyalty? Let me know your thoughts! Love you all. ❤️
###Chapter 52

"Fuck." A pained grunt forces my eyes open.

Daniel Carter clutched his bleeding shoulder, his face twisted in agony.

"Drop the goddamn gun, Daniel, or I swear to Christ I'll put a bullet between your eyes," Ethan Blackwood's voice sliced through the haze in my mind.

Of all people, he was the last I wanted to see. Shame burned through me. He'd warned me, and I'd been too stubborn to listen.

"The building's surrounded. You're outnumbered," Ethan added coldly.

Police sirens wailed in the distance, and relief washed over me.

Daniel lowered his gun slowly, placing it on the ground. His icy gaze locked onto mine, refusing to let me look away. I wanted to—needed to—but I couldn't. I deserved to remember how foolish I'd been.

"Sophia, look at me." Ethan's voice pulled me from Daniel's stare. Only then did I realize Ethan stood directly in front of me, shielding me.

Seeing him up close brought tears to my eyes. His last words to me months ago still echoed in my mind.

I kept my eyes on him as he unlocked the chains binding me. He was my anchor. If I focused on him, maybe I wouldn’t drown in this sea of pain.

"I've got you," he murmured, his voice impossibly gentle.

The moment I was free, I collapsed into his arms, too exhausted to hold myself up.

He pulled me close, and I fought back the tears threatening to spill. My gaze flickered back to Daniel. He was on the ground now, cuffed, his wound still bleeding. No one cared.

I watched as they dragged him away, my heart shattering at the loss of the future I'd foolishly believed in.

"Are you hurt?" Ethan asked, pulling back slightly.

The warmth of his embrace vanished, leaving me chilled to the bone. The cold wasn’t just on my skin—it seeped into my soul.

"Sophia?"

I shook my head, my voice trapped in my throat. Maybe if I stayed silent, this nightmare would end. Maybe I’d wake up and none of this would be real.

Nothing registered. Ethan’s lips moved, but I heard nothing. Sebastian walked in with a shell-shocked Amelia, followed by Gregory and a team of officers. None of it mattered.

I was numb. Or maybe beyond numb. Broken.

Why had he done this? Why pretend to care if he’d always planned to destroy me?

The more I thought about it—about us—the more I died inside.

I barely noticed when Ethan guided me out, his arm around my waist, holding me up. I didn’t even realize we were in a car until we hit a bump.

The ride was short. Soon, we pulled up to the police station.

Gregory met us and led us inside to give our statements. I barely remembered what I said or how long I’d zoned out.

"Sophia." Ethan’s voice was soft but firm.

I blinked, realizing we were in a stark white room. Not just us—Nathan, Sebastian, Amelia, and even Isabella were there.

Amelia had a bandage wrapped around her head. Absently, I touched my own and found one there too. I hadn’t even noticed.

"There was an ambulance at the warehouse. They checked you and bandaged the cut. You’re fine otherwise," Ethan said, as if reading my thoughts.

"Why is she here?" I pointed at Isabella.

The last thing I needed was her witnessing my downfall.

No one answered. They just stared at me with pity. I looked away, unable to bear it. Just as I was about to demand they all leave, the door opened.

Daniel and Gregory walked in.

Daniel was still cuffed, his shoulder bandaged. At least the bleeding had stopped.

"Sophia, you wanted to hear from Daniel. Here he is. Maybe he can explain why he deceived everyone—including our entire department," Gregory said wearily.

"He hasn’t talked?" Nathan asked, pulling Amelia closer. She had tears in her eyes.

I understood. I’d introduced her to Daniel. She must feel just as betrayed.

"No. He’s refused to say a word," Gregory admitted.

I turned to Daniel. His cold, emotionless gaze locked onto me, freezing me in place.

"Why?" My voice trembled. "Why did you do this?"

He stared, his eyes burning through me. Where was the warmth he’d once shown? Had it all been an act?

"I wanted the company," he said simply.

Shock rippled through me. I hadn’t expected an answer.

"What company?" I demanded.

I didn’t own a company. I invested, but I wasn’t like Ethan, with businesses under my name. The only thing I had was the Hope Foundation. Why would Daniel care about that?

"What company?" I pressed when he stayed silent.

I needed to know what had driven him to hurt me like this.

"Your grandparents' company," he said, his voice flat. "I worked for it. It should have been mine."

I laughed bitterly. "That makes no sense. I have no rights to it. If you wanted it, you should’ve gone after Nathan—it’s in his name."

Nathan glared at me, but I didn’t care. Everyone knew my family had left me nothing.

Daniel sighed. "I’m not talking about the Sterlings. I’m talking about your real grandparents."

Nathan exploded. "What the hell are you saying? Don’t listen to him, Sophia!"

I stayed silent.

"It’s not bullshit," Daniel snapped. "Tell me you’ve never doubted you were really a Sterling. Tell me you’ve never felt like an outsider."

My breath caught. I had doubted. So many times.

My family had treated me differently since I was a child. Nathan and Isabella got love, attention, gifts. I got indifference.

"You can’t deny it," Daniel said when I didn’t answer. "You know."

I looked away, unwilling to let them see the truth in my eyes.

"So you never saw us as family?" Nathan asked quietly.

"Did you ever see me as family?" I shot back. "I was always on the outside. Always looking in."

Isabella scoffed. "Oh, spare us the pity party."

"Why is she even here?" Daniel and I said in unison.

I glanced at him, then quickly looked away.

"She’s your sister," Gregory said, as if that explained anything.

"I don’t consider anyone in this room family except Amelia," I said flatly. "They can leave. Especially her."

Ethan tensed beside me, but I didn’t care.

"Can we focus on Daniel?" Sebastian cut in.

Daniel shrugged. "Let me tell you a story about a girl named Eleanor."

We fell silent as he began.

"Eleanor came from a middle-class family. Her father was a preacher, strict and devout. She was raised to follow every rule—until she met a boy. Alexander. They met at eleven, became friends, then fell in love by thirteen."

His voice was detached, robotic.

"Eleanor knew her parents would disown her if they found out. She planned to wait until college to be with Alexander openly. But then the unthinkable happened."

He paused. "She got pregnant at fourteen."

My stomach twisted.

"Alexander wanted to take responsibility. But her father lost his mind. He demanded she get rid of the baby. When she refused, they threw her out."

My chest tightened.

"Alexander’s family was wealthy. They took her in. Despite their age, they decided to keep the baby. But then Eleanor’s parents realized who Alexander was—and suddenly, they wanted the baby. They thought they could extort money."

Disgust rolled through me.

"Eleanor went into labor early. It was long, painful. When the baby was born... there was no cry." Daniel’s voice cracked. "The baby was stillborn."

I swallowed hard.

"Why are you telling us this?" I whispered.

"Because," Daniel said, his eyes locking onto mine, "Eleanor and Alexander are my parents."

He paused.

"And yours."

The room spun.

"You’re the baby they lost. The one who supposedly died."

The world shattered.
###Chapter 53

I sit beside Daniel Carter, frozen. My mind struggles to process his words. First, William and Victoria Sterling weren’t my real parents. Second, he claimed to be my brother.

"What?" I shriek as the weight of his confession crashes over me. "You slept with me knowing we were siblings? That’s vile!"

"You slept with him?" Ethan Blackwood’s voice booms, his presence suddenly suffocating the room. His aura turns lethal, darkening the air around us.

I shoot him a withering glare. "That’s not your concern."

My thoughts spiral. If Daniel’s words were true, then I had unknowingly committed incest. The bile rises in my throat. Disgust coils in my stomach. What kind of monster does that?

The more I learned about Daniel, the more I questioned if anything about him had been real.

"You’re not my sister," Daniel clarifies.

"But you just said Eleanor and Alexander Prescott are your parents," I counter.

"I told you I was adopted. That part was true. They took me in after my father died. We share no blood, so no, we didn’t commit incest." His smirk is infuriating. "Though I must say, I loved every time you moaned my name."

Heat floods my cheeks. I look away, mortified.

Even if we weren’t related by blood, his actions were still unforgivable. If he knew the truth, he never should have touched me.

Ethan tenses beside me, his fists clenched, jaw locked. I ignore him. His anger makes no sense.

Gregory clears his throat, slicing through the tension.

"If Eleanor’s baby died, why claim Sophia is that child?" he asks, dragging me back to reality.

Sebastian nods. "Yeah, that makes no sense."

It didn’t. If the doctors declared the baby dead, it was likely true. Daniel even admitted the infant was unresponsive at birth, and Eleanor witnessed it before passing.

"That’s what she believed," Daniel explains. "She held a funeral. Buried an empty casket. The grief destroyed her. She spiraled into depression, was institutionalized for months."

His voice softens. "She was never the same. Lost her will to live. Failed classes, graduated late. Alexander stood by her, but watching her suffer nearly broke him."

My chest tightens. I may not have known Eleanor, but as a mother, the thought of losing Liam would destroy me.

"With time, Alexander’s love pulled her through. They married at twenty-two. She wanted another child, but doctors revealed her traumatic first birth had left her infertile."

His expression darkens. "So they adopted me. Gave me their name, their legacy."

I recall how he once spoke of them with reverence.

"Then how does Sophia fit into this?" Ethan demands, his glare sharp enough to draw blood.

"My grandparents died in a plane crash," Daniel continues. "But I later discovered they’d been investigating their granddaughter’s disappearance. They suspected foul play but kept it from Eleanor and Alexander to spare them false hope."

His jaw tightens. "Then I found a hidden clause in their will. If Alexander retired or died, everything—including their company—would go to their granddaughter. The family lawyer knew."

He exhales sharply. "I couldn’t let that happen. I’d dedicated years to that company. So I dug deeper—and uncovered the truth. Eleanor’s parents paid off doctors to fake their granddaughter’s death."

My breath catches.

"They were ashamed of Eleanor’s out-of-wedlock pregnancy. Hiding a baby was impossible, so they staged her death and arranged an adoption."

His gaze locks onto mine. "I tracked you down. If you died, the clause would be void. When I learned how despised you were—even by your own husband—I thought I’d be doing the world a favor."

The pain is unbearable. This man, who once comforted me, had deemed me unworthy of life.

"The first attempt wasn’t mine," he admits. "But I seized the opportunity. Playing the hero was the easiest way to earn your trust."

Every word is a knife to my chest. I’d been blind. A fool.

"Why get close to me if you wanted me dead?" My voice is barely a whisper.

He shrugs. "I wanted to toy with you. Punish you for your sins. You were so trusting—it was almost too easy. And if the hitman failed, being near you made killing you simpler."

My hands clench. I had fallen for him while he plotted my ruin.

"It was supposed to be simple. Get close, then destroy you. But I didn’t count on—" He cuts himself off, something flickering in his eyes—guilt? Regret? It’s gone before I can decipher it.

I’m too broken to ask.

"But even if Sophia died, wouldn’t the company go to Liam?" Amelia asks.

"No," Daniel says coldly. "I erased all traces of her existence. And the will doesn’t mention her children."

"This is insane," Nathan snaps, standing. "You’re saying our parents knew and lied to us?"

Daniel’s lips curl. "Exactly. And after learning what kind of woman she is, I’m glad she’s not tied to your wretched family."

Nathan lunges, but Daniel sidesteps, sending him crashing into the table.

Ethan scoffs. "Says the man who wanted her dead."

Daniel’s glare shifts to me. "I called off the hitman, but he went rogue. By the time I realized, it was too late—he’d already taken you." His voice drops. "Believe that, if nothing else."

I can’t bear it. I bolt from the room, collapsing outside the station. Sobs wrack my body as betrayal consumes me.

Strong arms envelop me. Ethan’s familiar cologne surrounds me.

"Let it out, angel," he murmurs.

I pull back, tears streaking my face. "Go ahead. Say it. Tell me I was a fool."

His gray eyes soften. He pulls me close. "Never, Sophia. Never."

I shatter in my ex-husband’s arms, destroyed by the man I thought loved me.
###Chapter 54

The sun was already high in the sky when I finally stirred awake. For a blissful second, I thought everything was normal—until reality crashed down on me like a tidal wave. It wasn’t a nightmare. Daniel had truly betrayed me.

Tears pricked at my eyes again. I had cried myself to exhaustion last night, my pillow soaked with grief. I had gone to bed praying for a miracle, wishing that dawn would rewrite the truth. But nothing had changed. The pain was still there, raw and unrelenting.

I dragged myself out of bed, my limbs heavy with exhaustion. I couldn’t stay buried under the covers forever, no matter how much I wanted to.

A long, scalding shower did nothing to wash away the ache. I doubted anything ever could.

Dressed in an oversized t-shirt and leggings, I shuffled to the kitchen, my stomach hollow. Just as I reached for the eggs, the doorbell rang. I sighed. The last thing I wanted was company.

"Hi," Amelia said softly when I opened the door.

She looked as worn out as I felt—though her exhaustion was physical, while mine was a soul-deep wreckage.

"Hey," I replied, lingering awkwardly in the doorway.

I didn’t want to be rude, but I wasn’t ready to face anyone. I needed time to process the bombshells from yesterday.

"I know you probably want to be alone," she said, her voice gentle, "but can I come in?"

It still amazed me how well she understood me. We had only known each other for months, yet it felt like a lifetime.

I exhaled. "Yeah, sure."

As she stepped inside, I noticed the takeout boxes in her hands.

"Food," she explained.

I nodded, grateful. Cooking was the last thing on my mind.

We settled on the couch, eating in silence, both lost in our thoughts.

"So," Amelia finally said, setting her fork down. "How are you holding up? I’m worried about you, Sophia. This can’t be easy."

For a second, I considered lying—telling her I was fine just to end the conversation. Pretending was easier than facing the truth.

But the words died before they left my lips. I was drowning. I needed to talk.

"It’s not," I admitted. "I can’t wrap my head around the fact that Daniel isn’t who I thought he was. And the people I believed were my family… they’re not even related to me."

Which betrayal hurt more? I wasn’t sure.

I kept wondering—would my life have been different if I’d been raised by my real parents? Maybe I would’ve never met Ethan. But then I would’ve never had Liam.

The thought of losing him made my chest tighten. I missed him desperately. He had always been my anchor.

"I can’t even imagine what you’re feeling," Amelia murmured, pulling me back to the present. "I don’t even know how to comfort you."

I gave her a small smile. She wasn’t great at comforting people, but I appreciated her honesty. It was better than empty platitudes.

"I know," I said. "I just… I was finally starting to move on, you know? I thought I’d found someone who could love me. And then—before it could even begin—it was ripped away."

I blinked back tears. I refused to cry over a man who had played me.

Who was worse? Ethan, who had used me while pining for Isabella? Or Daniel, who had seduced me while plotting my death?

Amelia sighed. "I don’t want to sound harsh, but I need to be honest. If I’d realized this was how you were thinking, I would’ve stopped it sooner."

"What do you mean?"

"You can’t keep searching for men to love you," she said bluntly. "You went into this relationship with Daniel hoping he’d fill the void Ethan and your family left. But no one can do that for you, Sophia. Only you can."

I opened my mouth to argue, but she kept going.

"You’ve built this fantasy where love fixes everything. But the only person who can heal your heart is you. You have to love yourself first—and I don’t think you ever have."

I glared at her, defensive. "That’s not true."

"Isn’t it?"

I wanted to snap back. Of course I loved myself.

But then a quiet voice inside me whispered: Then why did you beg for Ethan’s love? Why did you rush into another relationship after the divorce? Why does every thought of moving on involve finding someone to love you?

I shook my head, refusing to listen.

"Sophia?" Amelia called.

"What?" I snapped, irritated.

She studied me for a beat. "Someone’s at the door."

Only then did I hear the doorbell. I had been so lost in thought that I hadn’t noticed. Guilt pricked at me for lashing out.

Exhausted, I trudged to the door—and froze.

Daniel stood on my doorstep.

My first instinct was to slam the door in his face. I reached for the handle—

"Sophia, wait," he said, blocking it.

He was the last person I wanted to see.

"What do you want?" I gritted out, torn between slapping him and breaking down.

"I know you don’t want to see me," he said carefully, stepping aside. "But there are two people I’d like you to meet."

That’s when I noticed the couple behind him.

The woman was stunning—long black hair, piercing brown eyes, an elegance that took my breath away. The man was tall, broad-shouldered, with honey-brown waves and striking green eyes.

They looked… familiar.

"Sophia," Daniel said quietly, "this is Alexander and Eleanor Prescott. My adoptive parents." He took a deep breath. "Mom, Dad… this is Sophia Sharp. Your daughter."

Their names hit me like a lightning strike.

Not only were they supposedly my parents—they were the Prescotts.

One of the most powerful families in the country.

Rumored to be even more influential than the Blackwoods.
###Chapter 55

"Please, come in," Amelia says from behind me, making me jump.

I realize I've been staring at them like an idiot, too stunned to speak.

Stepping aside, I let them pass, my mind still reeling. The Prescotts—Alexander and Eleanor—were in my house. And they might be my real parents.

"How are you even out?" I ask, turning to face Daniel the moment we're all seated.

"Bail," he mutters, his gaze fixed everywhere but on me.

Yesterday, Gregory had asked if I wanted to press charges against Daniel. He said it would strengthen our case.

I hadn’t answered.

Yes, what Daniel did was unforgivable. But he also taught me things—about myself, about life. I wasn’t sure I could destroy him.

Nathan was pressing charges. So was the police department. Daniel had faked documents to get close to me. Even if I didn’t press charges, Gregory said they’d proceed anyway—they’d opened a file on me after the murder attempts began.

"I’m sorry for what my son did to you, Sophia," Eleanor says, cutting through the tension.

I just stare.

She still calls him her son. Does that mean she condones what he did? If so, I’m not sure I want her in my life—even if she is my mother.

"You’re apologizing for him," Amelia says sharply. "And I’m guessing you’re the one who bailed him out. If what he said is true, does that mean you’re okay with what he did to your biological daughter? The daughter you supposedly mourned for years?"

Her words slice through the room.

"We are not okay with what he did," Alexander growls, his glare burning into Daniel. "It was monstrous."

"Then why bail him out?" Amelia presses. "He should pay for what he did. Playing with someone’s emotions while planning to kill them? That’s evil."

Every reminder of what Daniel did feels like salt in a wound.

"Because he’s still our son," Eleanor says, tears in her eyes. "We adopted him when he was ten. We love him."

I want to hate her answer, but I can’t.

As a mother, I’d stand by Liam no matter what. Even if he did something terrible, I wouldn’t abandon him.

I glance at Daniel.

His cold gaze meets mine, empty. No warmth. No remorse.

I look away.

"You’re here for a reason," I say bluntly. "If it’s about his case, I have nothing to do with it. If that’s all, please leave."

Their shocked expressions don’t faze me.

"We came because Daniel told us the truth," Eleanor whispers. "We came because you’re our daughter."

I want to believe her. But the family who raised me never loved me. Why would these strangers?

"How can you be sure I’m yours?" I stand. "Daniel could’ve made a mistake. I don’t look like you."

They’re stunning. I’m… ordinary.

Daniel hands me an envelope. "I took your hair. Ran a DNA test. It’s a match."

I open it.

He’s not lying.

My DNA aligns with Eleanor and Alexander’s.

"You have my hair," Alexander says softly. "And your mother’s eyes. But even without that… I know. You’re the daughter we lost."

Tears spill.

My whole life was a lie.

Every cruelty from the Sterlings—every hateful word, every wound—floods back.

They knew I wasn’t theirs.

Why keep me just to hurt me?

"It’s okay, my love," Eleanor murmurs, using the same endearment I call Liam.

She hugs me.

I didn’t see her move, but her arms feel like home. Something I never felt with Victoria.

Alexander joins us.

I sob until I’m empty.

"Better?" Eleanor asks gently.

I nod.

"You’re our daughter," Alexander says, voice thick. "We’ve loved you every day. We just want a chance to show you."

The difference between them and the Sterlings is staggering.

Before I can respond, the doorbell rings.

"I’ll get it," Amelia says.

Harsh whispers follow.

Then Nathan storms in, followed by Isabella and Tristan.

What now?

"I tried to stop them," Amelia mutters, glaring at Nathan.

"What do you want?" I’m exhausted.

"Mom wants to talk," Isabella says. "She has answers. But you’re not answering her calls."

I sigh.

The last thing I want is to hear Victoria’s excuses.

But I know I have to.
###Chapter 56

"What the hell is he doing here?" Ethan Blackwood's voice thunders through the room, his icy gray eyes locked onto Daniel Carter with lethal intensity.

I wasn't in the mood for his outbursts. Sure, he had been there for me yesterday, but that didn’t give him the right to dictate who stepped foot in my home.

Alexander Prescott—my father—clears his throat. It still felt surreal calling him that. The sound draws everyone's attention.

"Alexander Prescott?" Ethan says, surprise flickering across his face before he schools his expression. "What are you doing here?"

His gaze darts between us, connecting the dots as he looks from Alexander to Eleanor, then back at me.

"It's been a while, Ethan," Alexander says, his smile razor-sharp. "Though I can't say I'm pleased with how you've treated my daughter."

"What he means to say," Eleanor cuts in, her voice colder than I've ever heard it, "is that we're absolutely furious about the way you and your family have treated Sophia. And frankly, we no longer see the point in maintaining a business relationship with people like you."

Nathan's face pales. "How is this possible?"

Like I said—everyone knew the Prescotts. They might keep their lives private, but their name carried weight.

"Oh, sweetheart," Eleanor says, her glare sharp enough to draw blood. "In this world? Anything is possible."

I glance at Isabella, whose mouth hangs open in shock. If she wasn’t careful, she’d swallow a fly.

"Can we just get this over with so you can all leave?" I ask, staring Ethan down.

He nods stiffly, pulling out his laptop. We gather around as he dials Victoria. Her face soon fills the screen.

"We're all here, Mom," Isabella tells her.

Victoria exhales. "How are you, Sophia?"

I almost laugh. After twenty years of neglect, now she cares?

"Skip the fake pleasantries. Just say what you came to say."

She flinches, but I don’t care. Whatever redemption she was seeking—she was decades too late.

She takes a shaky breath. "You came to us when you were just weeks old, but we didn’t officially adopt you until you were fifteen months."

"What do you mean?"

"We had a housekeeper—Margaret. She’d worked for us for years. She wanted a child but couldn’t bear the thought of carrying another man’s baby. Her husband died after seven years of marriage, and she never recovered. They were about to start a family when he was killed by a drunk driver."

My chest tightens.

"Margaret decided to adopt. A month later, her mother called—said their church’s preacher had found a baby abandoned outside. She took a week off, went back home, and returned with you."

I exchange glances with Alexander and Eleanor. The preacher—was that my grandfather? This couldn’t be coincidence.

Victoria continues. "No one knew who your mother was. There was no identification. The preacher assumed you were left by a scared teenager. Margaret named you Sophia. She adored you—you brought her back to life after her loss."

My throat burns.

"If she loved me so much, why didn’t she raise me? How did I end up with you?"

Her voice wavers. "A year later, she was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer. The doctors gave her months. Before she died, she begged us to adopt you. We didn’t want to—we already had two children."

"Then why did you?"

Her eyes flicker to Nathan. "When he was two, he slipped out of the house. He nearly ran into traffic. Margaret saved him, but she was hit instead. She lost her right hand and walked with a limp ever since. We owed her. So when she died… we took you in."

I grit my teeth. "You should’ve left me at an orphanage. It would’ve been kinder."

Not a single happy memory tied to them—only pain.

Isabella scoffs. "God, you’re ungrateful. Do you know how many people would kill for your life?"

I snap. "Shut your mouth, Isabella, before I shut it for you." My voice is venom. "I slept with your boyfriend. Get over it. It’s pathetic watching a grown woman throw a tantrum like a toddler. Liam acts more mature than you."

The room goes silent. Isabella’s face burns red.

Eleanor’s hand grips mine. When I look up, she’s smirking. I’d forgotten they were here.

"I suggest you heed my daughter’s warning," Eleanor purrs. "You’ve punished her enough for a mistake made years ago. Speak to her like that again, and you won’t like what happens."

No one had ever defended me like this—except Scarlett. It felt strange. Good.

Victoria swallows hard. "I know we failed you. I’m sorry."

"Save it," I say coldly. "Your apologies mean nothing now."

Alexander stands. "Mark my words—you will pay for every tear she shed."

The threat hangs thick in the air. Crossing Alexander Prescott was a death sentence.

"Please, Mr. Prescott—" Victoria begs.

"How many times did my daughter beg?" Eleanor hisses. "You showed her no mercy. Why should we?"

Victoria falls silent.

"Get out," I tell Nathan and Isabella.

They leave, Ethan trailing behind. Daniel lingers, but I don’t look at him.

Alexander cups my face. "No one will hurt you again. Your enemies are ours now."

Eleanor kisses my forehead. "We love you, sweetheart. Always."

As they leave, I’m left with one question:

Did I want revenge?

And if I did—would they turn against Daniel for hurting me too?
###Chapter 57

“I still can’t wrap my head around the fact that Sophia is a Prescott,” Nathan mutters as we step into our parents’ house.

The news had hit me like a freight train. None of it felt real. Like my mind refused to process the bombshell that had just been dropped on us.

“Tell me about it,” I scoff.

I thought I had the upper hand against her. Discovering she was adopted had been the highlight of my year. But then Daniel had to go and ruin it by revealing her biological parents were filthy rich. I wanted her to come from nothing—some trashy family with no connections. That would’ve given me the satisfaction of knowing I was still better than her, no matter how much money she had now.

In our world, old money always trumps new money. It’s not just about wealth—it’s about legacy, influence, roots. I wanted Sophia to be the charity case, the girl who clawed her way up from nothing. Instead, she’s a Prescott. The Prescotts might not live here, but their name carries weight. Just like the Blackwoods, they’re part of the elite who pull the strings in this country.

If they publicly claim her? Her status will skyrocket. She’ll surpass me in every way. Worse—she’ll be on Ethan Blackwood’s level.

“What’s our move now? How do we even begin to fix this?” Nathan asks, snapping me out of my spiraling thoughts.

I glare at him. Is he serious right now? Why the hell would I want her forgiveness? She’s the one who should be groveling at my feet, begging for mercy after what she did to me.

“Forgiveness?” I spit the word like it’s poison. “Have you forgotten what she took from me?”

“I remember,” he says carefully. “But her parents said it’s in the past. She’s paid for her mistake. And let’s not ignore the fact that she was drunk—”

I cut him off with a sharp laugh. Drunk? Please. Sophia had been obsessed with Ethan for years. There’s no way that night was just some accident. Drunk or not, she knew exactly what she was doing.

“I will never forgive her, Nathan,” I seethe. “Never.”

This wasn’t a new decision. The bitterness had festered inside me for years, rotting everything it touched.

“Isabella, she’s our sister. You have to let go of this. Holding onto all this anger—it’s destroying you,” he says softly, stepping closer.

“How many times do I have to say it? I. Don’t. Care.” My voice rises to a shout. “Honestly, I wish that hitman Daniel hired had finished the job before he showed up to play hero.”

Without waiting for a response, I storm upstairs, slamming my bedroom door so hard the walls shake. Why couldn’t they understand? This wasn’t just some petty grudge. It was a wound that never healed, a constant ache in my chest.

Every damn day, it was there. In every breath, every thought. The betrayal had woven itself into my bones, and I didn’t know how to live without it.

I knew it was toxic. I knew it was eating me alive. But letting go meant admitting defeat. Letting her win.

Sophia stole everything from me. Ethan was all I ever wanted, and she took him. I built my entire future around him, certain we’d end up together. She ripped that away from me.

And now? Just when I thought things were finally turning in my favor, she waltzed back in and ruined it again. Ethan barely glances my way anymore. Not since that dinner. Not since he realized who she really was.

His attention is all on her now. And that? That makes me hate her even more.

Because I see it. The way he looks at her. He might not realize it yet, but it’s there. Something between them. My worst fear? That he’s in love with her.

The thought alone feels like a knife twisting in my chest.

I grab my phone and dial the only person who might understand.

“Hey, babe,” Evelyn answers on the first ring.

I collapse onto my bed, fighting back tears. “It’s all falling apart, Ev. I don’t know what to do.”

I’m exhausted. Drained. Carrying this weight for years has worn me down to nothing.

“Start from the beginning,” she says gently. “Then we’ll figure it out.”

So I tell her everything. Every painful detail since we last spoke. Reliving it all sends fresh agony through me. I can’t imagine a life where Ethan chooses her over me. We were supposed to be endgame.

“Listen, Isabella… I hate to say this, but I agree with Sophia,” Evelyn says carefully.

I freeze. “Excuse me?”

“Hear me out. I’m not Team Sophia, but threatening her son? That was low. And all those lies you fed Ethan? That’s not you. Those tactics won’t work—they’ll just push him further away.”

I open my mouth to argue, but she plows on.

“Second, none of this is Sophia’s fault. If anything, she’s backed off. I would too if the man I married was still hung up on my sister. The problem isn’t her—it’s Ethan. He’s either confused or in denial about his feelings.”

The words hit like a physical blow. The idea of Ethan having feelings for Sophia? Unbearable.

“Third, you need to heal. As long as you’re fixated on Ethan, Sophia will always be in the picture because of Liam. You two constantly at each other’s throats? That’s not sustainable. If it starts affecting Liam, Ethan will walk away for good.”

I hear her, but the words don’t sink in. Peace with Sophia? Impossible. Every time I look at her, all I see is the night Ethan told me he slept with her.

We never even had sex. I was waiting for the perfect moment. And she just… took that from me.

“Last thing,” Evelyn says, pulling me back. “You need to come clean.”

My blood runs cold. “Why would I do that?”

“Because it’s time, Isabella. Deep down, you know you’re not being fair to him. Think about it.”

She’s been saying this for years. But I’m not ready. I’ll hold onto my secret a little longer. I can’t face the fallout yet.

###Chapter 58

Have you ever felt like you're just going through the motions? Like the world around you is nothing but a blur, and everyone in it feels like a stranger? I looked it up. The internet called it dissociation—a coping mechanism for people who’ve endured childhood trauma. It’s like your mind builds a wall between you and the pain, leaving you numb.

After reading that, I realized Amelia might have been right. Maybe I did need professional help. Maybe therapy wasn’t such a bad idea. I had wounds that never healed, scars buried so deep I didn’t even know how to begin unraveling them.

With a heavy sigh, I stood and paced the room, my thoughts spiraling. I hadn’t spoken to anyone since that night when everyone crowded into my house. I ignored calls, shut out the world. I just wanted to be alone, to process everything without interference. But the weight of it all crushed me, leaving me hollow.

Then my phone rang, slicing through the silence. Gregory. Of course. Today was Daniel’s trial, and he wanted me to testify. But just like I couldn’t press charges, I couldn’t bring myself to stand against him.

I wasn’t excusing what Daniel had done. His actions were unforgivable. But every time I considered testifying, memories of the good moments flooded back—his laughter, the way he made me feel seen, the way he coaxed out a version of myself I never knew existed. And just like that, I’d retreat.

Daniel—the Daniel I thought I knew—had been kind to me. He made me feel alive, not just physically but in ways I hadn’t experienced before. That’s why his betrayal cut so deep.

With Ethan Blackwood, I always knew where I stood. Even as kids, he barely tolerated me because I was Isabella and Nathan’s sister. His cruelty hurt, but it wasn’t unexpected. His hatred was familiar, almost predictable.

But Daniel? His betrayal was a knife to the chest because I never saw it coming. I thought we understood each other. I thought his feelings were real. The pain came from the realization that none of it had been genuine.



I should’ve known better. Everyone in my life except Liam had hurt me. Now, I even doubted Amelia and my newfound parents. How could I be sure they weren’t playing me? The questions gnawed at me, driving me to the edge.

Tired of my own thoughts, I grabbed a hat, sunglasses, and my keys, then left without a destination. Somehow, I ended up at the courthouse, only realizing where I was after parking.

This is insane. I adjusted my disguise and stepped out of the car, hesitating before walking inside. I wasn’t here for justice. I was here to see him one last time.

Alexander and Eleanor Prescott had kept Daniel’s crimes out of the media—probably to protect their company’s image, though a small part of me wondered if they did it for him.

I slipped into the courtroom unnoticed, taking a seat in the back. The judge, a woman in her sixties, presided over the hearing. Daniel sat beside his lawyer, his expression unreadable. My parents were behind him. On the opposite side sat the prosecutor, along with Nathan, Amelia, and—surprisingly—Ethan.

I shouldn’t have been shocked. Ethan hated Daniel. Of course he’d want to watch him burn.

The judge asked for Daniel’s plea. His lawyer leaned in, then answered firmly: "Guilty."

Gregory testified first, explaining how Daniel had arrived months ago with forged transfer papers. No one questioned it—he seemed legitimate. Then came the other officers, Nathan, and finally Amelia, who recounted the kidnapping in chilling detail.

When the judge returned, she wasted no time. "Given the defendant’s guilty plea, I sentence Daniel Carter to two years for impersonating an officer, two for kidnapping, two for falsifying documents, and fifteen for attempted murder—with parole eligibility. Case closed."

Twenty-one years. The number echoed in my skull as I slipped out before anyone noticed.

But I wasn’t fast enough.

"Did you really think I wouldn’t recognize you, Sophia?"

I turned to find Ethan Blackwood staring at me, his grey eyes piercing.

I wiped my tears, stunned. How did he know?

"Are you okay?" His voice was softer than I’d ever heard it.

"No," I whispered.

He pulled me into his arms, his grip firm. "You’ll survive this. You’re the strongest woman I know."

I let myself cry, just for a moment, before pulling away as voices approached. "I need to leave."

Ethan studied me, then nodded. "I’ll drive you."

I handed him my keys without protest.

As I turned, I saw Daniel being led away in cuffs. Our eyes met—just for a second—before I looked away and got into the car.

It was time to say goodbye to a love that never had the chance to bloom.

Time to say goodbye to Daniel.


###Chapter 59

A month has passed since everything with Daniel went down. Am I okay? Hell no. Does it still hurt? Like a bitch. Have I moved on? Not even close.

Every day feels like I’m sinking deeper into an ocean of pain. I thought I was handling it when I decided to cut Daniel out of my life. But now I realize I was just lying to myself.

His betrayal ripped open every wound I’d ever tried to bury. Every hurt I thought I’d forgotten. It’s like I’ve been thrown back to the beginning—only now, my heart and soul are littered with fresh scars.

I move through my days in a haze. Numb. Time slips past me because I’m not really living—just surviving. One breath at a time.

Everyone else has moved on, but I’m stuck. Trapped in an endless loop of pain. My world is dark. Cold. And I’ve never felt more alone.

"Miss Sterling, are you okay?" Jacob, one of my students, asks.

Damn, I hate that name. It’s a constant reminder of the people who shattered me. I wanted to change it, but what would I even take? Not the Prescott name—I barely know them. And I haven’t spoken to them since that day at my house.

"Yes, I’m fine. Focus on your work," I mutter, staring down at my desk.

I used to love teaching. Now it’s just another chore. Every day, I count the minutes until I can escape. I crave solitude, but Amelia and Ethan keep checking on me, suffocating me with their concern.

My students notice. Classes aren’t fun anymore. I’m not the lively Sophia they knew. I’m a shell. A robot. Some have even started skipping. I don’t know how to bring back the woman I used to be.

Maybe you shouldn’t try to bring her back. Maybe you need to become someone new.

The thought lingers. Is that even possible? A new version of me—one who isn’t the broken girl, the shattered woman, the perpetual victim?

Before I can dwell on it, the bell rings. I grab my things and bolt without a word.

I keep my head down as I rush to the teacher’s lounge, desperate for a moment of quiet before my next class. Thankfully, no one stops me. I’m not in the mood for small talk.

But when I push open the door, I freeze. The room is packed. I groan and head for the farthest corner.

My phone rings. Eleanor Prescott flashes on the screen. I’ve been ignoring her calls, unsure how to face her—especially given her connection to Daniel. I go to decline, but my finger slips.

"Sophia?" Her voice is soft.

I don’t answer. Just exhale shakily.

"Please, darling, don’t shut me out. Don’t shut me and your father out," she whispers, her voice breaking.

I stay silent. My throat is too tight to speak.

"You’re my daughter. I want to be in your life. I want to be the mother I was meant to be. Losing you again… it would destroy me."

Tears burn my eyes. Damn it. I’ve been so emotional lately.

"I need time," I finally say, forcing the words out.

She exhales. "I’ll give you time. But remember—I love you. I’ve carried you in my heart every day, even when I thought you were gone. I’ll always be here when you’re ready."

It feels good to be wanted. But can I trust her? Only time will tell.

"Okay," I murmur before hanging up.

I get what she’s saying. But what if I’m just a placeholder? A way to fill the void? That’s what scares me—being used. Being second choice, like I was with Ethan.

I’m not being cruel. I’m just protecting what’s left of my heart.

"Damn, girl," Beatrice says, plopping down across from me.

I suppress a groan.

She’s a junior high teacher and the school’s biggest gossip. Always poking her nose where it doesn’t belong.

"Look at you," she tsks. "With the way you’ve been eating and how moody you are, people might think you’re pregnant." She laughs.

I freeze.

Her words echo in my skull, sending a bolt of terror through me.

She frowns. "Sophia? You know I was joking, right?"

I bolt up, panic clawing at my chest. I rush out of the lounge, blind with fear, and don’t stop until I’m in my car, speeding away.

No. No, no, no.

I try to think. To remember. But my mind is a mess.

I drive recklessly, not caring if I get pulled over. I need to know. Now.

At the store, I grab a handful of tests and nearly collide with Isabella at the checkout.

"Sophia?" she calls, startled.

I ignore her, pay, and flee.

At home, I chug water, then lock myself in the bathroom.

The result stares back at me.

No.

This can’t be happening. Not now. Not with Daniel’s baby.

"Why?" I whisper, tears streaming.

No answer comes.

I try to stand, but my legs give out. I’m drained. Empty.

Is this my fate? Unplanned pregnancies? First with Liam. Now this.

One time. That’s all it took. I forgot the morning-after pill. By the time I remembered, it was too late.

I told Daniel. He wasn’t angry—just calm. We convinced ourselves it wouldn’t happen.

I noticed changes. My period was late. But I blamed stress. My appetite? Stress-eating.

A loud bang at the door jolts me, but I don’t move. I don’t want to see anyone.

The banging continues. I curl up, covering my ears. Go away.

Silence. Then—footsteps. Heavy. Coming closer.

Before I can hide, a shadow fills the doorway.

"Sophia?" Ethan’s deep voice fills the room.

Our eyes meet.

And I break all over again.

Of all people… why him?
###Chapter 60

"What are you doing here?" I choke out between sobs.

Ethan kneels before me, his stormy eyes searching mine with an intensity I can't decipher.

"Isabella told me she saw you at the pharmacy," he murmurs, his thumb brushing away my tears. "She said you looked distraught and bought multiple pregnancy tests."

Damn Isabella and her loose lips! What did she hope to achieve by telling Ethan about this?

"She had no right to tell you. This isn’t her business—or yours," I snap.

He ignores my outburst. "Did you take the test?"

I nod, fresh tears spilling over.

"And?"

I can't bring myself to say it. The words stick in my throat like shards of glass.

When I don’t answer, his gaze sweeps the bathroom, landing on the discarded tests near the sink. He stands and picks them up. I should be furious at this invasion of privacy, but I’m too numb to care.

He returns and sits beside me, his shoulder pressing against mine.

"Congratulations," he says, his voice rough. "You’ll be an incredible mother."

I rest my head against him. "Will I? You never wanted another child with me, even though I begged for one. I thought it was because you believed I’d be a terrible mother."

The truth was worse. He hadn’t wanted a baby with me because he’d been waiting for Isabella to return. It was easier to believe he doubted my parenting than to face the reality—he simply hadn’t wanted me.

"I never thought that, Sophia," he says firmly. "You’re the best mother Liam could have. Anyone can see that." He hesitates. "Can I tell you something?"

I nod.

"I was always jealous of your bond with Liam. I still am."

My head jerks up in shock.

"Really?"



I can’t believe Ethan is here, sitting on the cold bathroom tiles with me. The Ethan I knew wouldn’t have cared enough to wipe my tears, let alone comfort me.

"Yeah," he admits.

Silence settles between us. Exhaustion pulls at me, and before I know it, I’m drifting off. I don’t remember falling asleep or how he carried me to bed. The last thing I feel is the brush of his lips against my forehead.

I wake the next afternoon to a cold breakfast on my nightstand. Probably Ethan’s doing.

After showering and dressing, I call my gynecologist. My body feels heavy, drained.

I skip the food and head to my car, driving slower than necessary, delaying the inevitable.

The clinic is filled with couples, reminding me of my pregnancy with Liam. Ethan had never attended a single appointment. The fact that he’d been present for the birth had shocked me—he’d shown so little interest before.

I push the memories aside and check in.

"Sophia Sterling," the nurse finally calls.

Dr. Bennett smiles warmly. "What brings you in today?"

"I need an ultrasound. My tests were positive, but I want confirmation."

My hands tremble as I lie on the exam table. The cold gel on my stomach makes me flinch.

"You’re definitely pregnant. About three months along," she announces as a steady heartbeat fills the room.

Tears blur my vision. She sounds thrilled. I feel nothing but dread.

After the appointment, I drive aimlessly, the ultrasound photos burning a hole in my backseat. I’d hoped the tests were wrong. But there’s no denying it now.

I park at a cliff’s edge, staring into the abyss.

How can I love this baby? It was conceived through lies, by the man who tried to destroy me. Every time I look at them, I’ll remember Daniel’s betrayal.

One step. That’s all it would take.

"Ava!" Ethan’s voice cracks like thunder behind me.

I don’t turn. The wind howls, urging me forward.

"Sophia, step back. Now."

I’m so tired. Tired of pain, of fighting.

"I can’t do this anymore," I whisper.

He yanks me back, his grip ironclad. "Think of Liam! Would you leave him motherless? And your baby—are you really so selfish you’d kill an innocent life?"

At Liam’s name, I go limp.

"You’re seeing a therapist," Ethan growls. "You’ll face this. You’ll be the mother your children deserve—or so help me, Sophia—"

He doesn’t finish. He doesn’t need to.

I collapse against him. He carries me to his car, his heartbeat erratic against my ear.

"Thank you," I murmur.

His lips brush my cheek. "I’ll always find you."

He’s right. Liam deserves better. So does this baby.

Which means I have to do the unthinkable—tell Daniel he’s going to be a father.
###Chapter 61

Fuck. I rake my fingers through my hair as I watch her sleep. The dried tear tracks on her cheeks are still visible, and seeing her like this—so utterly shattered—tears me apart.

Sophia has always been a master at masking her emotions. But today, she didn’t. Today, it was raw. Unfiltered.

Her pain was drowning her, and without realizing it, she was pulling me under with her.

I sink into the chair beside her bed, my fingers threading through her silken hair as I massage her scalp gently. How the hell had I never noticed how soft and thick her hair was? Just touching it feels like heaven.

A quiet sigh escapes her lips, her face relaxing as the tension melts away. In sleep, she finds peace—no shadows haunting her, no ghosts whispering in her ear.

I know it’s creepy, but watching her sleep has become my guilty pleasure. I did it yesterday. And here I am again.

She’s breathtaking. Even with the dark circles beneath her eyes, she’s radiant. How the hell did I ever convince myself she couldn’t compare to Isabella?

I press a featherlight kiss to her cheek before forcing myself to stand. Every instinct screams at me to climb into bed beside her, to pull her close and never let go.

But I don’t.

Because I know she wouldn’t want me there. She might have accepted my comfort tonight, but that doesn’t mean she’s forgiven me.

Hell, I haven’t even asked for forgiveness.

And I need to.

Just… not yet. Not when she’s still so fragile.

With one last lingering look, I slip out of her room and into the night. The cool air does nothing to clear my head.

I pull out my phone and dial Sebastian. He answers on the first ring.

"Meet me at the club," I say before hanging up.

I don’t wait for a response. I know he’ll be there.

Half an hour later, I’m stepping through the VIP entrance of my club, nodding at the bouncer before heading straight for my private booth. The pounding bass does nothing for my throbbing headache.

Xavier, my personal bartender, appears with my usual drink before I even ask.

Sebastian strolls in moments later, his sharp gaze assessing me. "What’s got you in such a foul mood?"

"Nothing," I mutter, slumping back into the leather seat.

But the image of Sophia on that cliff won’t leave me. That single step she took toward the edge—it nearly stopped my heart. The terror that gripped me was unlike anything I’ve ever felt.

If I’d been even a second later…

I can’t think about it.

"You forget, brother," Sebastian drawls, taking the seat across from me. "I know you better than you know yourself."

"Sophia," I rasp, her name like a blade in my throat.

"You care about her."

"Of course I fucking care about her. She’s Liam’s mother," I snap, frustration boiling over.

But it’s more than that, and we both know it.

Sebastian leans forward. "It’s always been more than that. You’re just too stubborn to admit it."

I grit my teeth. He’s been harping on this for months—that my feelings for Sophia run deeper than I’ll acknowledge.

Bullshit.

If I were in love with her, I’d know.

Wouldn’t I?

"How is she?" he asks when I don’t respond.

"She’s pregnant."

His eyes widen. "Daniel’s?"

I clench my jaw. "Who else?"

The moment I found out, something inside me fractured. Knowing she carried that bastard’s child made everything too real.

I’d been trying to ignore the fact that she’d slept with him. But now? Now there’s no denying it.

And it fucking kills me.

Which makes no sense. I wanted her to move on. I wanted her to leave me alone. I was planning to propose to Isabella, for Christ’s sake.

But knowing Sophia let another man touch her?

It feels like a part of me died.

"So what’s she going to do?" Sebastian asks, pulling me back to the present.

I stare into my glass. "I don’t know."

I consider telling him about the cliff but stop myself. That moment belongs to Sophia. I won’t betray her trust, not even to my brother.

"Sir." Xavier reappears, handing me a small envelope before retreating.

Sebastian cocks a brow. "What is it?"

I tear it open. A single slip of paper falls out.

[I don’t target children. Your son is safe. But the rest of your loved ones? That’s a different story. I’m coming for you, Ethan. And everyone you care about.]

It’s signed with Damian Slade’s insignia.

I should be afraid.

But all I feel is relief.

Because Liam is safe.

That’s all that matters.

I won’t let Sophia experience that kind of fear again. It’s time to bring Liam home.

He’s always been her lifeline.

And right now, she needs him more than ever.

###Chapter 62

I’m scrubbing the house from top to bottom, desperate to keep my mind occupied. The news still hasn’t fully sunk in—I’m pregnant.

When Ethan had shut down the idea of another child, I’d resigned myself to Liam being an only child. Now, against all odds, there’s another baby on the way, and I don’t know how to process it.

My phone rings. Normally, I’d ignore it, but not today. Pushing everyone away hasn’t helped.

"Hi, Amelia," I murmur, sinking onto the couch.

Lately, exhaustion has been relentless. I should’ve realized something was off.

"Oh my God, you actually answered!" she shrieks, her voice thick with emotion. "I thought you’d ghosted me forever. It’s been weeks!"

"I’m sorry," I exhale. "I didn’t know how to handle everything, so I pushed you away."

I’ve never been good with emotions. When things get overwhelming, I shut down. Burying feelings has always been easier than facing them—until now.

"Are you okay?" she asks softly.

"Not completely," I admit. "But I will be."

I don’t know how yet, but I will pull through.

The memory of considering ending it all—myself and this baby—makes me sick. This child is mine, just like Liam. I will be a good mother to them.

I shake off the dark thoughts. I can’t dwell on how far I fell.

"I’m pregnant," I whisper when the silence stretches.

"What?" Her gasp is sharp. "Since when?"

"A week ago."

Just like with Liam, this baby is unexpected. But that doesn’t change anything. I’ve always wanted another child. Even if I can’t stand their father right now, that’s not this baby’s fault.

"Oh, darling, congratulations," she breathes, her voice warming with joy.

"You sound happy. I thought you’d be upset, given… the father."

"I am happy. A baby is a blessing, Sophia. This little one? They’re your lifeline. They came exactly when you needed them." Her voice cracks. "You were drowning. We all saw it. This baby pulled you back when nothing else could."

Her words hit hard. She’s right. Liam and this baby are why I’m fighting to get better.

"Thank you for not giving up on me," I whisper, tears pricking my eyes.

"You’re my sister in every way that matters. I’d never give up on you."

We talk for over an hour, shifting to lighter topics. By the time we hang up, I feel more like me than I have in weeks.

I finish cleaning, collapsing onto the sofa just as the front door swings open.

I tense. Who the hell walks in without knocking?

Then I hear his voice.

"Mommy! I’m home!"

My heart soars. I bolt up just as Liam barrels into the living room.

"Liam!"

He crashes into me, and I crush him against my chest, tears streaming. He fits perfectly in my arms. I’ve missed him so much.

I cover his face in kisses, and he giggles but doesn’t pull away.

"Mom!"

"I missed you! How are you here?" I ask, still holding him tight.

We’re a tangled mess on the floor, but I don’t care. I’m just so happy.

"Dad brought me. He said you needed me. It was a surprise!"

Only then do I notice Ethan standing there. Our eyes lock. There’s something unreadable in his gaze.

"Hi," I say softly.

He’s been checking on me daily—supportive, kind. It’s unsettling. This isn’t the Ethan I know.

True to his word, he got me a therapist. Every kind act leaves me stunned.

"Hey, Sophia. How are you today?" he asks with a small smile.

"I’m… getting there," I shrug.

Liam tugs my sleeve. "Is it true? You’re having a baby?"

I glare at Ethan, who rubs his neck sheepishly.

"Yes," I admit nervously.

Liam’s never mentioned wanting a sibling. But then—

"Yes!" He punches the air. "Can it be a girl? I want a baby sister!"

His excitement eases the knot in my chest. If he’s happy, maybe everything will be okay.

"It doesn’t work like that, sweetheart," I laugh. "It could be a boy."

"No! It’s a girl. I always get what I want," he declares, looking so much like Ethan it’s eerie.

"Liam—"

"Buddy," Ethan cuts in. "Give me and your mom a minute?"

Liam nods and dashes upstairs.

"How did you know I needed him?" I ask, standing.

Ethan shrugs. "Instinct."

"But is it safe? The Reapers—"

"They won’t touch Liam," he says firmly. "That’s all that matters."

I don’t react to his vague "they." Liam’s safety is my only concern.

"Thank you. For bringing him back. For… everything."

"Anything for you, Sophia."

The words throw me. Since when does he say things like that?

Before I can overthink it, Liam’s footsteps thunder downstairs.

"Mom! My room is awesome! Even better than the video!"

I smile. Why Ethan’s changed doesn’t matter. I’ve got bigger things to face—like seeing Daniel tomorrow.

###Chapter 63

When I set my plan in motion, falling in love with her was never part of the equation. That realization hit me harder than any bullet ever could.

I thought it would be simple. Eliminate her, claim what was rightfully mine. But Sophia wasn’t just another target—she was a force of nature. The kind of woman who rewires your soul before you even realize it.

I tried resisting it. Like trying to outrun a hurricane. Futile.

By the time I admitted my feelings, the damage was irreversible. The truth would surface eventually, but instead of walking away, I clung to her like a drowning man to driftwood. Every second with her was borrowed time.

Hurting her is my greatest sin. Her pain became mine, our hearts breaking in tandem. I traded a future with her for greed, and if she never forgives me, I’d deserve it.

"Daniel, you’ve got a visitor," a guard barks.

I’ve refused my parents every visit. Shame coils in my gut like a live wire. They gave me their name, their love—and I repaid them by trying to murder their blood daughter.

Yet here they are. Again.

I almost tell the guard to send them away when something stops me. A reckless, desperate hope.

The cuffs bite into my wrists as I’m led out.

New inmates usually get tested. Not me. My reputation precedes me.

Then I see her.

Sophia sits in the far corner, hands twisting in her lap. My pulse roars in my ears.

The guard uncuffs me.

"Sophia?" My voice cracks as I sit.

I memorize her face—the curve of her lips, the gold flecks in her brown eyes. This is goodbye. Closure before she moves on.

She can’t even look at me for long. The sight of me hurts her. And God, it destroys me.

No future. No wedding. No watching her belly swell with my child.

The loss carves me hollow.

"I almost didn’t come," she whispers. "But I had to."

Her uncertainty guts me. I did this. Broke the woman who once looked at me like I hung the stars.

"What is it, Sophia?" I soften my voice, fighting the urge to reach for her.

She inhales sharply. "I—"

The words stick. My chest tightens. What’s wrong?

"Sophia—"

"I’m pregnant."

The world tilts.

Three months. Our last night together flashes behind my eyelids—her skin against mine, the way she gasped my name.

Then cold reality slams in.

"You’re here to tell me you’re terminating it." My jaw locks.

Her head snaps up, fury igniting her eyes. The old Sophia—the fighter—surfaces. "How dare you? At first, I considered it. But this baby deserves life."

Relief nearly buckles me.

"I came to ask if you want to be involved," she continues. "Or if you’d rather walk away."

The answer tears from me: "No."

Better my child never knows a monster.

She stands abruptly. I brace for the finality of her footsteps.

Then she sits back down.

"Why?" she demands. "Because I was just a pawn?"

"What can I offer from prison? By the time I’m out, they’ll be grown. I’ll miss everything. And no kid should have a father who hurt their mother like I did you."

Silence stretches.

Then—

"This baby will know you," she says fiercely. "Visits. Letters. You won’t miss a single milestone if you choose not to."

Stunned, I stare. How is she this merciful?

"Thank you," I rasp.

She slides a sonogram across the table. My throat closes. A tiny bean-shaped blur. Mine. Ours.

"I care about you," I blurt as she stands.

She freezes.

"I love you, Sophia. Deeply. Irrevocably."

A tear slips down her cheek. "It’s too late."

"I know. But it doesn’t change the truth."

"I imagined a future with you," she whispers. "It was so real. I was ready to love you—fully. Then you burned it all down."

I surge to my feet, agony shredding me. She’d begun to love me too.

The knowledge is a knife to the ribs.

"Will you ever forgive me?"

"Maybe. Not today."

I kiss her then. Desperate. Devouring. Our last.

When she pulls away, I let her go.

Some losses are permanent.

###Chapter 64

I lounged in a secluded booth, savoring a decadent slice of chocolate cake. Liam was spending the night at Ethan’s, which meant I had the rare luxury of a child-free evening.

For some inexplicable reason, my mood was lighter than usual. Seizing the moment, I’d indulged in comfort food—hence the mountain of dessert in front of me, devoured as if I hadn’t eaten in weeks.

My visit to the prison had been… unexpected. I’d braced myself for Daniel to reject the baby outright. Instead, he’d blindsided me with a confession of love.

It left me hollow. He had to understand—it was too late. After everything he’d done, reconciliation was impossible. The man had literally tried to kill me. Going back to him would be nothing short of self-destruction.

That didn’t mean I’d deny him his rights as a father. But I refused to be the one facilitating visits. Natalie could handle that. It was the bare minimum I’d concede, and not an inch more.

Men? Done. Love? A losing game. I’d chased it twice and ended up with nothing but scars. Clearly, the universe had other plans for me. Fine. I’d focus on myself—on becoming the best version of me, the best mother for Liam.

I forked another bite of cake, moaning as the rich flavor melted on my tongue.

“Aren’t you worried about gaining weight? Oh wait, too late.”

The shrill voice snapped me out of my bliss. My eyes flew open to find Cassandra smirking at me, flanked by her snickering coworkers.

I rolled my eyes. Here we go.

She was one of Ethan’s financial advisors and, as evidenced by her sneer, despised me. I never understood her obsession. Sure, I’d been married to Ethan—a man she clearly wanted—but anyone with half a brain could see he’d loathed me.

“I’m talking to you, you pathetic cow,” she spat when I ignored her.

I sipped my juice lazily. “By all means, keep talking. Doesn’t mean I’m listening.”

Back when I was desperate for Ethan’s approval, I’d endured her insults in silence. Now? Not a chance.

“Think you’re hot shit now that you’ve got money?” She leaned in, voice dripping with venom. “Let me guess—you earned it on your back.”

I laughed. “Projecting much, Cassandra? Not everyone climbs the ladder by spreading their legs.”

Her face twisted. “You bitch!” She lunged, but I stood in one fluid motion, meeting her glare with icy calm.

“Take one more step,” I warned, “and I’ll make sure you regret it. The old Sophia took your crap lying down. Push me now, and I’ll push back harder.”

She glanced at her friends for backup, but they faltered under my stare.

“Are you threatening me?” she hissed, stepping closer.

I shrugged. “If the shoe fits.”

“One word to Ethan, and he’ll ruin you,” she sneered. “We’ve played this game before. You know how this ends.”

Once, that threat would’ve sent me scrambling to appease her. Not anymore.

“Go ahead. Call him. Right now.” I smirked. “I dare you.”

The confidence I’d lost after Daniel’s betrayal was creeping back. No man would ever break me again.

“What’s going on here?”

A sharp voice cut through the tension. Natalie stood between us, arms crossed. We weren’t close—more like business associates. Her family’s construction firm handled my Hope Houses, and this restaurant was hers.

“She’s causing a scene,” Cassandra lied instantly. “We were just sitting here when she started hurling insults.”

I snorted. “Oh, please.”

Natalie’s gaze flicked to the security cameras. “Try again. I saw everything.”

Cassandra paled. “It—it was a misunderstanding—”

“Get out.” Natalie’s voice was lethal. “Now. Or I’ll have security drag you out.”

Cassandra floundered before snapping, “This place is overrated anyway.”

A blatant lie. Everyone knew Natalie’s restaurants were the best in the city.

As Cassandra stormed off, her so-called friends scurried after her, cursing her for getting them banned.

“Thanks,” I said to Natalie. “She was grating on my last nerve.”

She smiled. “Anytime.”

Before I could reply, a voice froze me in place.

“Sophia?”

I turned slowly.

Standing there, tears in her eyes, was the woman who’d once called me her daughter—and treated me like a burden.

My so-called mother.

###Chapter 65

"Sophia, can we please talk?" Victoria pleads as I turn to leave.

I stare at her, unsure what she wants. What more is there to say? Haven't we already said and done enough?

"There's nothing left to discuss, Mother," I say firmly.

Looking back, I realize how I always kept her at arm's length. While Isabella and Nathan called them Mom and Dad, to me, they were always Mother and Father. Formal. Distant. Impersonal.

I never truly accepted them as my parents because deep down, I knew the truth. Parents don’t despise their own child. They don’t neglect them or treat them like garbage. The way I addressed them reflected what they were to me—strangers who shared my blood but not my heart.

"Please, I'm begging you," she whispers, tears glistening in her eyes.

It’s surreal seeing her like this—face flushed, expression soft. This isn’t the woman I know. The one who always frowned at me, whose gaze was laced with icy indifference reserved only for me.

"Why don’t you show me to our table while they talk?" Rosalind, Ethan’s mother, suggests to Natalie, cutting off my response.

Natalie hesitates, reluctance clear in her eyes. She knows the Sterlings have never been fond of me, despite the DNA that supposedly ties us together.

Rosalind doesn’t wait. She links arms with Natalie and guides her away, leaving me alone with Victoria.

I exhale sharply and sit down. "Let’s get this over with. You won’t leave me alone until you’ve said your piece, so say it now before I change my mind," I say coldly.

Once, I adored her. When I was five or six, I believed she hung the moon. But that illusion shattered when I realized I was nothing more than a burden to her.

She hesitates before taking the seat across from me, reaching for my hands. I pull away. I don’t want her touch. The part of me that craved her affection died long ago.

"I’m sorry, Sophia. More than you’ll ever know," she whispers, voice breaking.

I stay silent. I used to fantasize about this moment—her apologizing, pulling me into her arms. I prayed for it. But now that it’s here, I feel nothing. No joy. No relief. Just emptiness.

"The way I treated you was wrong. You were just a child, and instead of loving you, I pushed you away. You loved us, and we gave you nothing but scorn. If I could go back, I’d change everything. I’d be the mother you deserved," she continues, tears streaming down her face.

"I never saw your worth. I never realized how incredible you are. It took almost losing you to understand how much you mean to me."

She’s sobbing now. The old me would’ve been moved. But not now. Her tears mean nothing.

Twenty-five years of pain can’t be erased by a few tears. It would take a miracle to undo that damage.

"Let’s skip the theatrics, okay? If this is about my mother’s threat to your company, we can discuss it like adults. No need for the emotional manipulation—it won’t work. Just tell me the real reason you wanted to talk," I say flatly.

Hurt flashes in her eyes, but I don’t care. She’s hurt me for decades. This is nothing compared to what I’ve endured.

Besides, I know why she’s here. It’s not about me—it’s about saving the Sterling empire.

"It hurts that you’d think that of me. That you’d believe my apology is just a ploy to save the company. But I have no one to blame but myself. My actions made me untrustworthy in your eyes."

Looking at her now, it’s hard to believe she’s the same woman who screamed at me for the smallest mistakes. Who made me feel invisible. This heart-to-heart is unsettling—we’ve never had one before.

"I truly want your forgiveness. I want to be your mother in every way. I want to rebuild what I destroyed."

I sigh. "I don’t mean to be cruel, but first—you’re not my mother. The DNA test in my safe proves that. Second, that ship sailed years ago. You and me? Close? Never happening. And lastly, I don’t want you in my life. In fact, I’d prefer if you and your children kept ignoring me like I don’t exist. You’ve done it for thirty years—it shouldn’t be hard to continue."

Some might call me ungrateful. Maybe I am. But the things they gave me were material. What I needed was love. Knowing what I know now, I’d have been better off in an orphanage.

"Please don’t say that. Don’t say it’s too late," she whispers desperately.

"But it is. You’re twenty-five years too late."

She wipes her tears, determination hardening her features. "I won’t give up on you, Sophia. You’re still my daughter, and I’ll do anything to earn your love back."

I rub my temples, feeling a migraine coming on.

I don’t respond as she stands. She can cling to her delusions all she wants—nothing will change my mind. The love I once had for her is dead, and it’s not coming back.

"Before I go, I want to give you this. Your father asked me to before he died. I never had the chance."

I don’t acknowledge her. She sighs and places something on the table before walking away.

Only when she’s gone do I look.

My breath catches.

It’s a piece of paper.

With bloody fingerprints.

And then it hits me.

This is the same paper I saw William handing her before his surgery.
###Chapter 66

The letter lay on my kitchen table, taunting me.

I'd been home for an hour, pacing, debating—should I read it or burn it? The envelope had felt like a live coal in my purse the entire drive back. Now, here it was.

Staring at me.

Part of me was morbidly curious. The other part? Couldn't care less. The man who wrote it despised me. What good could come from his dying words?

My fingers twitched toward it, ready to shred the paper, when that damn voice piped up.

Just read it, Sophia. What's the worst that could happen?

I nearly laughed.

Famous last words.

The worst? He could destroy me all over again. Words were weapons—far deadlier than knives. I still carried the scars from my so-called parents' cruelty. Some wounds never healed.

OPEN IT! the voice shrieked.

Before I could chicken out, I unfolded the letter.

[Dear Sophia,

If you're reading this, I didn't survive surgery. Truthfully, I don't expect to. The doctors are wasting their time—I'm already gone. I can see your grandparents beckoning. Maybe it's a dying man's hallucination, but I know hell has a special place for how I treated you.

You were such a bright little girl when Margaret left you with us. We extinguished that light. I'll regret that until my last breath.

I remember when Margaret was alive. How I'd play with you, Isabella, and Nathan in the evenings. You were so innocent then...]

I stopped reading. None of this made sense. If he'd enjoyed my company back then, why the hell had everything changed?

Hands shaking, I continued.

[I don't know what twisted inside me after Margaret died. When she begged us to take you in, something in all of us... broke. This isn't an excuse—nothing could justify our cruelty.

This is my punishment. Karma's a vicious bitch. I'm getting exactly what I deserve.

Before I go, know this: I'm sorry. For all of it. These words will never undo what I did, but they're all I have left. I'm sorry for being a monster. For being the villain in your story.

I won't ask forgiveness—I don't deserve it. Just... be there for Victoria. She'll realize her mistakes, and it will destroy her.

Remember—I loved you. Even if I failed to show it.

Goodbye, my sweet girl.]

I shoved the letter back in my bag, anger boiling in my chest.

Why did this affect me when Victoria's tears hadn't? Maybe because these were his final words. Written as death clawed at him.

I stormed to my bedroom, slamming the door. No. I wouldn't think about them. Wouldn't relive the pain. If I let those memories in, I'd drown.

Weakness wasn't an option. I'd already shattered once—I wouldn't let the darkness take me again.

I collapsed onto the bed, refusing to cry. They didn't deserve my tears.

Exhaustion dragged me under into dreamless sleep.

I woke at eleven.

Shit! I bolted upright, tumbling off the bed. I was supposed to pick Liam up at nine—Ethan had a business flight.

I showered and dressed in record time, nearly breaking my neck racing downstairs—only to freeze.

Ethan and Liam sat at the kitchen island. Ethan—in a full suit—was flipping pancakes. Since when did he cook?

"Mommy! Daddy said let you sleep!" Liam announced through a mouthful of food.

"What's going on?" I demanded.

"Making breakfast. Sit." Ethan didn't look up from the stove. "I'll finish these before leaving."

"Aren't you late for your meeting?"

"Fuck the meeting." He said it so casually, as if rescheduling multimillion-dollar deals was nothing. "You needed rest."

This version of Ethan unnerved me. Caring. Domestic. I didn't want to see it—didn't want to reconcile this man with the one who'd shattered me.

I mechanically took toast and eggs, watching him warily.

"When's your next doctor's appointment?" he asked suddenly.

I narrowed my eyes. "Next Friday. Why?"

"No reason." He turned off the stove. "I have to go."

After kissing Liam goodbye, he hesitated. Those storm-gray eyes locked onto mine, conflicted.

I held my breath, praying he'd leave. His proximity suffocated me.

"See you both tonight," he finally said, and I exhaled as he walked away.

Liam waved. "Bring me a present!"

Ethan paused in the doorway, shoulders tense. For a heartbeat, I thought he'd say something more. Then the mask slid back into place—cold, unreadable Ethan. He left without another word.

I stared at the empty doorway. Why was he acting like he cared?

A hollow laugh escaped me. Ethan didn't care. This was all for Liam's benefit. Another performance.

Had to be.

Right?
###Chapter 67
"What?" Isabella whispers beside me, her voice trembling with shock.

The entire room falls into stunned silence. Every face reflects pure astonishment. No one had anticipated this.

No one could have imagined that Sophia—quiet, unassuming Sophia—was the mastermind behind one of the largest charitable organizations in the country.

Hell, I was married to her for years, and I had no damn clue. That says everything about how blind I've been.

"Did you know about this?" Sebastian asks, his eyes wide, mouth slightly agape.

"No," I growl, frustration boiling inside me. How had I missed something so significant about her?

I watch as Sophia pushes back her chair and rises. Daniel stands with her, offering his hand with a warm smile. She places her fingers lightly in his, and he escorts her toward the stage. My jaw tightens when his palm lingers on the bare skin of her back as he helps her up the steps.

Once she reaches the podium, he steps aside. She embraces Elizabeth briefly before taking her place at the microphone.

"Hi," she chuckles nervously, clearing her throat. "For some reason, addressing a room full of rowdy teenagers is easier than speaking to a room full of adults."

A ripple of laughter spreads through the crowd.

She continues, her voice steady now. "Most of you already know me, but for those who don’t—my name is Sophia Sterling. As Elizabeth mentioned, we’re here today to celebrate all of you for your unwavering support of the Hope Foundation."

Her gaze sweeps across the room, commanding attention. "As a teacher, I’ve witnessed heartbreaking realities—children with bruises from abusive homes, kids going hungry because they can’t afford lunch, students wearing tattered clothes because their families can barely survive. And worst of all, children who have no home at all."

The room is utterly silent, every ear tuned to her words.

I’ve never seen the city’s elite so captivated by a speech before.

"Seeing their suffering broke my heart," Sophia continues. "So I started helping—one child at a time. First one boy in my class, then another, and another. Before I knew it, I was supporting dozens. That’s when the idea for the Hope Foundation was born."

She pauses, her eyes shining with emotion. "I wanted to create a safe haven for them—a place where they wouldn’t have to worry about survival. We began with the first Hope House, and by God’s grace, we’ve expanded to every major city in the country."

Pride radiates from her as she gestures to the tables filled with children of all ages. "In four years, we’ve helped thousands of kids. Some have gone on to prestigious universities like Harvard and Princeton. Others are still under our care, from infants to teenagers. We ensure they lack nothing—food, education, even allowances for the older ones."

Her voice softens. "This foundation exists to give them hope—to prove that their past doesn’t define their future. So from the bottom of my heart, thank you. Your support has changed lives."

The room erupts in applause as she steps back. People rise to their feet, clapping until she descends the stage.

Elizabeth takes the microphone. "That concludes tonight’s program. Please, enjoy the rest of your evening."

I stare at Sophia, utterly mesmerized. Who knew there was so much depth beneath her quiet exterior?

"Damn," Nathan mutters beside me, shaking his head. "I never would’ve guessed she founded the largest children’s charity in the country."

His gaze flicks between Sophia and Amelia, who remains seated while Sophia is swarmed by children. One of them—a young man—looks oddly familiar.

"No kidding," Sebastian adds, still slack-jawed.

It’s surreal. Like she had an entire secret life none of us knew about. And I never miss details.

Someone drops into the seat Olivia had vacated. I turn, ready to snap, only to find Elizabeth settling in.

"Don’t mind me," she sighs, pulling out her tablet. "Just exhausted. You’re Sophia’s family, right?"

Nathan nods numbly.

"Perfect." She starts typing without another word.

Isabella leans in. "Isn’t that Jacob Montgomery of Montgomery Tech? What’s he doing with Sophia?"

I follow her gaze to the young man now laughing with Sophia. Of course—that’s why he looked familiar.

Montgomery Tech exploded onto the scene two years ago. At twenty, Jacob became the youngest self-made CEO in the industry. His innovations have made him a formidable name, threatening to dethrone even the most established businessmen.

If I were the jealous type, I’d be worried about him overtaking my spot as the top entrepreneur in the country.

Elizabeth answers without looking up. "Jacob was one of our first beneficiaries. An orphan. Sophia recognized his talent early, encouraged him to start his own company, and funded it when no one else believed in him. Now he’s worth millions. As thanks, he made her the second-largest shareholder in Montgomery Tech."

Another bombshell. We exchange stunned glances.

Isabella scoffs. "So she’s profiting off these kids?"

That’s it. I slam my palm on the table. "Enough with the damn snide remarks."

Heads turn, but I glare them into silence. Isabella looks at me like I’ve lost my mind.

Elizabeth raises an eyebrow. "Where have you been living? Sophia doesn’t need anyone’s money. She was a millionaire long before this foundation."

Nathan frowns. "What?"

Elizabeth shrugs. "She’s private about it, but trust me—she’s loaded. If she wanted, she’d rank among the top five wealthiest women in the country."

I do the math. That would put her net worth in the billions.

"The best part?" Elizabeth continues. "She doesn’t flaunt it. No designer labels, no flashy cars. People underestimate her constantly."

A bitter realization hits me. We underestimated her. Repeatedly.

Even when I offered her that divorce settlement, assuming she’d struggle without me—God, what a fool I was.

Isabella pales. "That’s impossible."

Elizabeth smirks. "Shouldn’t her own family know this?"

Shame burns through me. We were her family. And we treated her like an outsider.

Before I can dwell on it, a commotion erupts.

Sophia is standing toe-to-toe with Penelope Harrington—the self-proclaimed queen of high society.

And from the look on Penelope’s face, this won’t end well.

###Chapter 68

My fingers drum against the armrest as I sit in the clinic's waiting area, waiting for my name to be called.

Nervous doesn’t even begin to cover it. My pulse is racing, my palms damp.

It’s like history repeating itself. My second pregnancy, and once again, I’m alone at my appointments. The only difference? This time, Ethan can’t be here—whereas with Liam, he simply chose not to come.

I’d been in denial about this pregnancy until a few days ago, when my jeans stopped fitting. The bump is undeniable now. Soon, everyone will know.

I exhale, rubbing my temples. I need to tell my parents. But how? How do I explain that I’m carrying Ethan’s child—their adopted son’s baby? The whole situation is twisted beyond words.

But there’s no undoing it. This baby is coming, whether I’m ready or not.

"Your anxiety is practically radiating off you, Sophia."

That deep, familiar voice snaps me back to reality.

I turn so fast my neck twinges. My breath catches.

Ethan Blackwood stands there, his storm-gray eyes locked onto mine. He looks unfairly handsome, his expression unreadable.

"Ethan? What are you doing here?" I blink, half-convinced I’m hallucinating.

He shrugs, the ghost of a smirk on his lips. "Support. Didn’t want you sitting here alone."

I stare. This man has never smiled at me before. Never cared enough to show up.

Something’s off.

I reach out, pressing my palm to his forehead. "Are you sick? Feverish? Because this isn’t—"

"What the hell are you doing?" He frowns, swatting my hand away.

"Checking if you’ve lost your mind."

Before I can interrogate him further, the nurse calls my name.

Ethan takes my hand, pulling me up with unsettling gentleness. He leads me to the exam room, his grip firm. I stare at his broad back, baffled.

Dr. Bennett greets us with a warm smile. "Ready to see how your little one’s doing, Sophia?"

I nod, still dazed.

"And this must be the father?" She glances at Ethan.

"No!" I cut in before he can speak. "He’s just… here."

Ethan’s jaw tightens, his fingers squeezing mine almost painfully.

"Alright then." Dr. Bennett gestures to the exam table. "You know the drill—shirt up, please."

Ethan helps me up, his gaze lingering on my exposed stomach. It’s surreal—the last time he saw me like this was over a year ago.

The cold gel makes me flinch as Dr. Bennett moves the wand.

"Hmm." She studies the screen.

"Is something wrong?" Ethan demands before I can speak.

"Everything’s perfect. Strong heartbeat, perfect growth." She turns to me. "Want to know the gender?"

"No," I say at the same time Ethan says, "Yes."

Dr. Bennett arches a brow. "Since you’re not the father, I’ll defer to Sophia. Unless you’ve changed your mind?"

I shake my head. "I want it to be a surprise, like with Liam."

She prints the sonogram, handing me two copies—one for Ethan, though I don’t say it aloud.

As we leave, Ethan surprises me again. "Lunch. Now."

"Why?"

"We need to talk."

I scan the street for a taxi. "There’s nothing to discuss."

His expression darkens. "Get in the car, Sophia. Or I’ll put you there myself."

I glare but relent, sliding into his Porsche.

The restaurant is upscale, quiet. The moment we’re seated, I snap. "What’s going on with you? You never cared before. Why now?"

His gaze is unflinching. "Because I was wrong."

The admission stuns me. Ethan Blackwood doesn’t apologize. Ever.

"I blamed you for everything," he continues, voice rough. "I let you shoulder the guilt alone. You were eighteen. Scared. And I made sure you stayed that way."

My throat tightens. "Why are you saying this now?"

"Because I can’t undo what I did." His hands clench. "But I can stop pretending I don’t regret it."

I look away, my chest aching. Forgiveness isn’t that simple.

The damage is done.

And some wounds never fully heal.
###Chapter 69

The silence between us was suffocating. Lunch had been painfully awkward, neither of us speaking a word. My mind was still reeling from Ethan’s apology. I didn’t know what he expected from me, but forgiveness was off the table—at least for now.

After we finished eating, he drove me home. The car ride was just as quiet, both of us lost in our thoughts. I didn’t know how to process this new version of him. It was unsettling, to say the least.

"Thank you," I said as we pulled up to my house. "For coming to the appointment and for lunch."

"It was nothing," he replied, attempting a smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes.

I nodded and reached for the door handle, but his hand caught mine, stopping me.

"I want you to tell me about all your future appointments," he said, his gaze intense.

I stared at him, baffled. "Why the hell would I do that?" I yanked my hand away. His touch burned, sending an unwanted shiver down my spine.

"Because I want to be there for you," he answered simply.

"And again, why? You weren’t there when I was pregnant with Liam, but now you want to show up for a baby that isn’t even yours? Do you hear how insane that sounds?"

He was messing with my head, and I hated it. I hated feeling uncertain. I hated that he was acting so out of character.

Not to mention, I didn’t need drama with Isabella. If she found out Ethan was attending my doctor’s visits, all hell would break loose.

"I just want to be there. Is that so hard to believe?"

"Actually, yes. Let’s be real, Ethan. You’ve never cared about me." I sighed. "That’s putting it mildly—you downright despised me. So this sudden concern? Unbelievable."

He didn’t respond immediately, just kept staring at me with that unnerving intensity. The longer he did, the more I fidgeted under his piercing gaze.

"Just tell me," he finally said. "Because one way or another, I’ll find out, and I’ll show up—just like today."

"Have you considered how this will affect your relationship with Isabella? How she’ll feel?"

I was using her as a shield, but right now, she was my best bet at making him see reason.

"Isabella doesn’t fucking matter right now," he growled, his eyes turning icy.

My jaw dropped. Never in a million years did I think I’d hear him say that.

"What the hell is wrong with you?" I demanded. "Do you hear yourself? How can you say she doesn’t matter when you’ve been in love with her your entire life?"

The surprises just kept coming. Every word out of his mouth felt like it was rewriting the reality I knew.

His jaw clenched, nostrils flaring at the mention of his decade-long obsession with Isabella.

"Drop it," he snarled.

So, she was still a sore subject. Not that it surprised me. Sooner or later, they’d make up. Isabella never gave up on what she wanted, and Ethan had never been able to resist her.

Done with the conversation, I pushed the car door open and stepped out. I was halfway to my front door when his voice stopped me.

"Remember what I said, Sophia. I’ll be at every appointment—whether you tell me or not."

With that, he sped off, leaving me standing there, stunned. His forcefulness was getting under my skin. Why couldn’t he just go back to ignoring me?

I was almost at my door when movement caught my eye. A man was watering his lawn across the street. He turned, as if sensing my stare, and our eyes locked.

He was undeniably attractive, but that wasn’t what held my attention. There was something familiar about him—I just couldn’t place where I’d seen him before.

Shaking off the thought, I offered him a polite smile before heading inside.

"Mommy, you’re home!" Liam shouted the second I walked in.

Since my appointment had been in the afternoon, I’d asked Gabriella, his nanny, to pick him up from school. She wasn’t live-in—she only came when I was tied up.

"How was school?" I asked, setting my bag down.

"Awesome! I aced my math test!"

"That’s my genius boy," I teased, making him blush.

"Mom," he groaned. "Stop."

"What? It’s true. I’m so proud of you."

He flashed me a mischievous grin, and I knew exactly where this was going.

"Can I play video games since I’m a math genius?"

I sighed. "Fine. One hour."

He bolted upstairs, yelling thanks over his shoulder, making me smile.

"Gabriella, you’re free to go," I called out as I walked into the kitchen.

"Are you sure?"

"Positive. Go enjoy your evening."

She smiled and gathered her things. Fifteen minutes later, she was gone, and I immediately regretted sending her away.

With Liam occupied, I was alone with my thoughts—and they were spiraling.

I was about to start dinner early when the front door swung open.

"Yoohoo! Sophia, where are you?"

Amelia’s voice brought an instant smile to my face.

"Kitchen!" I called back.

Moments later, she walked in, followed by Natalie. I blinked in surprise.

"Look who I ran into! We got here at the same time," Amelia said, plopping onto a stool.

I’d told Amelia how Natalie had defended me against Cassandra. She’d instantly taken a liking to her, saying anyone who stood up for me had her respect.

"What brings you here?" I asked Natalie.

"You gave me an opening at the restaurant, so I took it. I’ve always wanted to be your friend, so… here I am."

Part of me was skeptical, wanting to shut her out. But I pushed that instinct down. It was time to stop pushing people away.

"Welcome to my humble abode," I said with a genuine smile.

Amelia leaned forward. "Okay, but real talk—have you seen the gossip column? It went up an hour ago."

"No. Why?"

She handed me her phone. My stomach dropped as I read the headline:

[Billionaire Ethan Blackwood Spotted on Lunch Date with Ex-Wife Sophia Sterling Months After Divorce—Weeks After Rumors of Him Dating Her Sister, Isabella Sterling]

Beneath it was a photo of Ethan guiding me into the restaurant, his hand on the small of my back.

"Shit," I muttered. "This is going to cause so much drama."

Isabella would lose it. I wasn’t afraid of her, but I didn’t need the trouble. The photo made it look intimate—something it absolutely wasn’t.

"Is there something going on that I don’t know about?" Amelia asked while Natalie watched us curiously.

"Nothing. He showed up unannounced at my appointment and asked to talk over lunch." I recounted everything, including his apology.

By the time I finished, I was even more confused. None of it made sense, no matter how I looked at it.

"What if he’s genuinely sorry?" Amelia asked.

That was the question I’d been avoiding. I wasn’t ready to face it.

"I don’t know," I admitted. "Forgiveness has to be earned, and so far, he hasn’t done anything to deserve it. All he’s done is leave me with more questions."

How was I supposed to move on? For nine years, he’d made sure I knew he hated me. Now, suddenly, he was sorry? It didn’t feel real.

"What do you think, Natalie?" Amelia asked.

Natalie had been quiet, but now she spoke softly. "I think these are the actions of a man who doesn’t realize he’s in love."

I burst out laughing. "Good one. Ethan doesn’t love me."

Had they forgotten the way he’d stormed into my house, defending Isabella?

"Think about it," Natalie insisted.

Amelia nodded. "She might be right. Why else would he suddenly care? Unless he always did and just never realized. And why now, after the divorce? Maybe losing you made him face his feelings."

I didn’t want to hear it. Instead of responding, I changed the subject.

The rest of the evening was perfect. We laughed, talked, and for the first time, I felt like Natalie was truly part of our circle.

But despite the fun, their words lingered in my mind.

Ethan couldn’t possibly love me.

They had to be wrong.

Because Ethan Blackwood had only ever loved one woman—and her name was Isabella Sterling.

###Chapter 70

The morning air was crisp and refreshing. With nothing pressing on my schedule, I found myself lounging at home, savoring the rare moment of peace.

Liam had already left for school, leaving the house quiet. After my recent emotional spiral, I had made the decision to step back from teaching. My students weren’t thrilled, but they understood—I hadn’t been myself lately.

I planned to return after the baby arrived. For now, my focus was on my children and the Hope Foundation.

Processing everything that had happened in the past few weeks was still a challenge. The sudden shift in everyone’s behavior, except for Isabella’s ever-present disdain, was jarring.

But I refused to dwell on it. Instead, I grabbed my phone and dialed my mother. She answered instantly.

"Hey, Mom," I greeted, still adjusting to the word.

"Sophia!" she squealed, her voice bursting with excitement. "Alexander, darling, our girl is on the phone!"

A shuffling sound followed, then the familiar echo of speakerphone.

"Hi, Dad," I added.

Their love story fascinated me. High school sweethearts, still inseparable after thirty-five years. If I had still believed in love, theirs would have been the kind I’d chase.

But I didn’t. I had accepted that love wasn’t in the cards for me. My future was set—just me and my children.

"Sweetheart, how are you?" Dad’s warm voice pulled me from my thoughts.

"I’m good. Just wanted to check in."

I still hadn’t told them about the pregnancy. My bump was starting to show, but oversized shirts hid it well. Deep down, I knew it hurt them, though they never let it show.

As for Daniel, I understood his guilt. He was avoiding them because he felt unworthy of their kindness.

I had sent him the latest ultrasound. His response had been emotional—he couldn’t wait to meet our baby. He respected my choice to keep the gender a surprise until birth.

"Sophia?" Mom’s voice snapped me back.

"Sorry, zoned out for a second," I murmured.

"It’s fine, darling. Are you still coming this weekend?"

"Yes, but Liam won’t be there. It’s his weekend with Ethan, so it’ll just be me."

The Blackwood and Sterling families used to have monthly gatherings. I was rarely invited, and when I was, I was treated like an outsider.

Noah was the only one who ever acknowledged me. Most times, I ended up leaving early or crying in the bathroom.

The gatherings had stopped for months, but now that my parents were back, they had resumed.

"Shame he can’t make it, but we’re happy you’re coming," Dad said.

I was about to reply when a sudden noise distracted me—a bark, then scratching. At first, I thought I imagined it. Then it happened again.

"Dad, I’ll call you back. Something’s up," I said quickly.

"Alright, sweetheart."

I hung up and followed the sound to the backyard.

Chaos.

My garden—completely destroyed.

I gaped at the devastation.

"Do you have any idea how long it took me to grow those?" I fumed, glaring at the culprit—a massive, fluffy husky with striking gray eyes that reminded me of Ethan and Liam’s.

He whined, giving me puppy-dog eyes, but I wasn’t falling for it.

"Organic food was the whole point of this garden," I snapped. "And you just wrecked it."

He whimpered, but I crossed my arms.

"Oh no, those adorable eyes won’t work on me. How are you going to fix this?"

Despite my irritation, my resolve wavered. He was ridiculously cute—thick black-and-white fur, those soulful eyes.

"Never seen someone melt so fast over my dog," a deep voice remarked.

I turned so fast I nearly gave myself whiplash.

Holy hell.

The man standing there was unfairly attractive—jet-black hair, piercing green eyes, sharp cheekbones, and a jawline that could cut glass. His lips looked sinful, and his body? Pure temptation.

I knew what I was thinking: Sophia, don’t be fooled again by a pretty face.

But appreciating beauty wasn’t the same as falling for it.

"Have we met before?" The question slipped out before I could stop it. "You look familiar."

He studied me before answering. "Yeah. Same school. You were two years below me."

I wracked my brain but came up blank. Back then, I’d been too obsessed with Ethan to notice anyone else.

"Lucas Montgomery," he supplied when I still looked lost.

Recognition hit.

"Oh my God—Nerdy Lucas?" I blurted.

He groaned at the old nickname, shooting me a glare that had zero effect.

"Wow. You had one hell of a glow-up," I said, stunned.

The Lucas I remembered was scrawny, with oversized glasses and braces. His face had been a battlefield of acne, and he’d spent more time in the library than with people.

Now? He looked like he belonged on a magazine cover.

"Yeah, well, thanks," he muttered awkwardly.

"I also remember you had a massive crush on Isabella. How’d that work out for you?" I teased.

His expression darkened. "And you were in love with Ethan. How’d that go?"

"Touché," I murmured.

The old pain flickered, but I pushed it down.

I didn’t know Lucas well, but I was glad he’d escaped Isabella’s toxicity. Her love for Ethan would have destroyed him, just like Ethan’s love for her had destroyed me.

"Dad, can I watch TV?" A small voice interrupted.

I turned to see a boy with the same striking green eyes as Lucas.

"Hi, I’m Sophia," I said, unable to resist.

"Hi," he replied shyly.

"What’s your name?"

"Oliver."

"I have a son your age—Liam. You should come over and meet him when he’s back from school. If that’s okay with your dad."

Oliver looked up at Lucas, who sighed in defeat.

"Fine," he grumbled.

I studied Lucas, searching his eyes. There was something there—pain, loneliness, a wounded soul.

He shifted uncomfortably. "I’ll get someone to fix your garden tomorrow."

"Rex," he called, and the husky trotted to him.

With a nod from Lucas and a smile from Oliver, they left through a gap in the fence I’d never noticed.

I watched them go, realization dawning.

In Lucas’s eyes, I had seen the same darkness I’d been running from for years.

A kindred spirit.

And I couldn’t help but wonder—what had hurt him so deeply?
###Chapter 71

"Liam, have you finished your homework?" I call out, but there's no response.

It's Friday afternoon, and exhaustion weighs me down like lead. Pregnancy fatigue hits differently this time—every little task feels like climbing a mountain.

At least I’ve been spared the morning sickness, unlike when I was carrying Liam. Small mercies.

"Liam?" I try again, louder this time.

Silence. That’s unusual. He always answers immediately unless something has completely captured his attention.

Before I can drag myself upstairs to investigate, the doorbell rings.

I sigh. It’s not that I don’t want company—I just desperately need a break. A long, hot bath sounds heavenly right now.

My day at the Hope Foundation was grueling—piles of documents, dry eyes, and a mind fried from overwork. My entire body aches.

Reluctantly, I shuffle to the door and swing it open—only to freeze.

Lucas Montgomery and his son, Oliver, stand on my porch.

It’s been two days since our awkward encounter in the backyard. When Oliver didn’t show up to walk home with Liam after school, I assumed Lucas wanted nothing more to do with us. He’d been downright surly that day.

"Hi," I say, unable to mask my surprise.

"Hello, Miss Sophia," Oliver chirps, beaming. He thrusts a bouquet of pink roses toward me. "These are for you."

"Oh!" I take them, touched. "Thank you, Oliver. They’re gorgeous." Without thinking, I bend and press a kiss to his cheek.

When I straighten, he ducks his head, cheeks pink. Just like Liam, he’s sweet beneath the shyness.

I glance at Lucas. "Would you like to come in?"

He hesitates, but Oliver tugs his hand insistently. Lucas relents.

I lead them to the kitchen, where the scent of freshly baked cookies and cupcakes fills the air. Liam had begged for them, and exhausted or not, I could never refuse him.

"Perfect timing," I say as the oven timer dings.

I grab a vase for the roses, then set a plate of warm cookies in front of our guests.

"Liam!" I call again.

"Coming, Mommy!" His voice echoes from upstairs.

A door slams. Footsteps thunder down the hallway, then the stairs. Seconds later, he bursts into the kitchen—and skids to a halt at the sight of visitors.

"Come here, sweetheart." I beckon him over. "I want you to meet someone."

Liam edges forward, hesitant. He’s always shy at first—until he warms up. Then he’ll talk your ear off.

"Liam, this is Oliver. He lives next door. Oliver, this is my son, Liam."

I brace for awkwardness, but to my surprise, Oliver grins. "Hi!"

"Wanna see my room?" Liam blurts.

"Sure!"

Just like that, Liam shoves a handful of cookies into Oliver’s hands, grabs juice boxes from the pantry, and drags him off. "I’ve got a new game to show you!"

I blink. That was… effortless.

"Well, that went better than expected," Lucas murmurs. "Oliver never makes the first move. He’s usually reserved."

I turn to him, having momentarily forgotten he was still here. "Liam’s the same way. Takes him a bit to warm up."

"Really? Because Oliver doesn’t just warm up—he avoids people altogether. Even at school, he keeps to himself. At this point, I think Thor and I are his only friends."

My stomach twists. That’s not normal for a child his age.

If Oliver is that withdrawn, something’s wrong. And it’s not Lucas—anyone can see how much they adore each other.

Something else is hurting that boy.

"Maybe Liam can help bring him out of his shell," I murmur, handing Lucas a cupcake.

I sink onto a stool, finally off my feet, and take a bite. Bliss.

After a moment, Lucas speaks. "I owe you an apology."

"For what?"

"My behavior the other day. I was rude."

I wave him off. "You were fine. If anything, I was being extra."

But the memory of the raw pain in his eyes lingers. He’s hiding it well now, but I recognize that kind of hurt.

It’s easy to spot when you’ve been broken too.

"So, what do you do?" he asks, shifting topics.

"I’m a teacher, but I’m on leave for a few months."

I’d considered going back, but I needed this time—for the pregnancy, and for my own sanity.

"You and Ethan Blackwood, then?" Lucas nods toward the stairs where the boys disappeared. "Liam’s his spitting image."

I snort. "Half the city knows how that mess went down. It wasn’t some grand romance—just a drunken mistake."

Sometimes I curse that night, wondering how different life could’ve been. Then I remember: no that night, no Liam. So I’m left hating it and loving it all at once.

"What happened?" Lucas asks.

My skin prickles. "That’s a story for another day."

Ethan hasn’t contacted me since the doctor’s appointment three days ago. No surprise visits from Isabella either, demanding I stay away. Maybe he’s too busy smoothing things over with her.

Good. The less he’s around, the better. His recent behavior only confuses me more, and I’m tired of trying to figure him out.

"What about you?" I ask. "Where’s your wife?"

Lucas stiffens. "I don’t have one."

"Oliver’s mom, then?"

Pain flashes across his face—deep, soul-crushing agony. The kind that isn’t yours but sears you anyway.

My heart cracks. I know that pain.

"She’s… not around," he says hoarsely.

Oh God. I shouldn’t have asked.

"I’m so sorry," I whisper.

He exhales shakily. "It’s been a while. I’m… learning to live with it."

I squeeze his hand, offering silent comfort.

Later, as we talk about lighter things—like replanting the garden Thor destroyed—I realize why Oliver is the way he is.

Losing a parent that young leaves scars. Some never heal.

I don’t know them well, but right then, I make a promise to myself: I’ll help them.

Everyone deserves happiness.

And from the looks of it, Lucas and Oliver haven’t had any in a long, long time.
###Chapter 72

The monthly family gathering was in full swing today. The Blackwoods and Sterlings had maintained this tradition since Liam was barely five years old.

Our families had always been inseparable. Mostly because our mothers, Victoria and Rosalind, had been thick as thieves since their childhood days.

Naturally, their children grew up as best friends, and the bond between both families only deepened over time.

"Dad, why are you driving like a snail? We're gonna miss Grandpa's famous ribs!" Liam whined, his little face scrunched up in frustration.

If not for Liam's insistence, I wouldn't have bothered coming. I used to relish these gatherings—especially when I knew Sophia wouldn't be there. When she wasn't invited.

Back then, I considered these events my sanctuary from her. Being surrounded by people who despised her as much as I did felt like sweet relief.

Now? Now it just makes me sick with guilt. I loathe myself—and everyone else—for the hell we put her through.

"I'm driving just fine," I muttered through clenched teeth.

"No, you're not! You're moving slower than Grandma's arthritis!" he shot back, crossing his arms.

Did my eight-year-old just roast me? I shook my head with a reluctant chuckle and pressed the accelerator slightly.

The moment silence settled in the car, my thoughts inevitably drifted to Sophia.

She'd looked absolutely breathtaking when she opened her door earlier.

To me, she embodied some divine fertility deity—swathed in that flowing white dress, her cascading curls framing her glowing complexion, that subtle baby bump enhancing her ethereal beauty.

What shocked me most was my visceral reaction—the overwhelming urge to sweep her into my arms and lose ourselves in her bedroom for days.

1/5



This unfamiliar intensity terrified me. I'd never reacted to her like this before.

She's all I think about now. No matter what I do, her image is branded into my mind, distracting me from everything else.

The depth of my obsession frightens me. Countless times I catch myself wondering: What's she doing right now? Did she eat properly? Is she getting enough rest? Should I hire a housekeeper to help her?

These thoughts unsettle me profoundly. I'd always kept Sophia at arm's length. Now? Now I'm consumed by the need to care for her, and this internal conflict is tearing me apart.

"Dad?" Liam's voice snapped me back to reality.

"Yeah?"

"We're here."

I blinked, startled to find us already parked outside my parents' estate. I didn't even recall driving here—I'd been so lost in thoughts of Sophia that I'd operated on autopilot.

Reckless. Especially with Liam in the car. But I can't help it—she dominates my every waking thought.

"Come on, champ. I'm sure Grandpa saved you the best ribs," I said, forcing cheerfulness to dispel the tension.

"Dad...are you okay?" He hesitated instead of exiting the car.

The concern in his voice twisted my gut. How could I explain that my current turmoil stemmed from his stunning mother?

"Just work stuff, buddy. Nothing for you to worry about."

He nodded skeptically and unbuckled. We stepped out simultaneously.

As I locked the car, the front door swung open before we reached it.

"Grandma!" Liam sprinted toward Victoria.

"My sweet boy! I've missed you terribly," she cooed, bending to catch him in a fierce embrace.

2/5



Despite everything with Sophia, William and Victoria adored Liam unconditionally. Everyone did. Our hatred had been reserved solely for Sophia—the woman we'd wrongfully accused of betraying me and Isabella.

"Where's your mother? I sent her an invitation," Victoria asked, straightening to peer behind us.

"Oh, she's visiting Grandma Eleanor and Grandpa Alexander today," Liam announced cheerfully. "She was really excited—they missed last week's visit because of some business trip."

Liam remained oblivious, but I noticed.

I saw the exact moment Victoria's smile shattered. The flash of anguish in her eyes. This had to kill her—knowing Sophia was bonding with her biological parents while every bridge to her adoptive mother lay in ashes.

Victoria had burned those bridges herself. Hurt Sophia too deeply for forgiveness. My ex-wife wanted nothing to do with Sterlings or Blackwoods anymore.

The only reason I remained in her life? Because I'm Liam's father—and because I've been relentless. Otherwise, she'd have discarded me like everyone else.

"Perhaps next time," Victoria managed a tremulous smile.

She was barely holding it together. Liam couldn't witness his grandmother's breakdown—it would raise questions I wasn't ready to answer. Once he learned how we'd treated his mother, there'd be hell to pay.

Liam's loyalty to Sophia was absolute. If he discovered our cruelty, we'd become instant enemies in his eyes.

"Let's head inside," I interjected, steering them toward the house. "Everyone's probably waiting."

Victoria excused herself to compose herself while Liam and I proceeded to the backyard.

I suppressed a groan seeing the full attendance. Liam dashed ahead, leaving me trailing.

He greeted everyone—except Isabella. Didn't even glance her way. His open disdain for her never wavered.

"Finally decided to join us, son," William clapped my back heartily.

He knew I hated it. Did it anyway.

"Yep," I muttered, already counting minutes until I could leave.

"Nothing says 'family time' like that enthusiasm," Sebastian quipped sarcastically.

I glared at my twin. Unlike others, he never flinched—our identical genes apparently made him immune.

"Ethan, darling!" Rosalind embraced me. "I've missed you."

I returned the one-armed hug stiffly. "You too, Mom."

We separated as Victoria reappeared, eyes suspiciously red.

Liam was already devouring ribs at the table with Tristan.

Scarlett had declined Tristan's invitation—refusing to socialize with Sophia's tormentors. Her fierce loyalty was straining their relationship. Tristan walked on eggshells, terrified of losing her after his role in hurting her best friend. Only his genuine remorse kept her from walking away.

"Can we talk, Ethan?" Isabella's voice slithered into my ear.

Damn it. I hadn't noticed her approach.

"Nothing to discuss," I said flatly, turning to face her.

I'd been avoiding her. Still furious about her vile comments regarding Liam. More than that—I simply couldn't stand her presence anymore. Not when Sophia occupied my every thought.

I'd loved this woman once. Cherished her even during my marriage to her sister. I'd been convinced no one else could ever compare.

All I'd wanted was her return. I'd sworn that if she gave me another chance, I'd divorce Sophia and build a life with her.

She'd been back for months. Yet that "eternal love" I'd professed? Gone. Extinguished.

I felt like a fool. One moment declaring undying love for Isabella, the next recoiling from her touch.

These sisters were driving me insane.

"Ethan—"

"What?" I snapped, suddenly suffocating.

Tears welled in her eyes, but for the first time, I felt...nothing.

Without another word, I turned and walked away.

For years, I'd played the "what if" game. What if I finally got the woman I'd always loved? What if we married and started our own family? What if life had gone as planned years ago?

These questions had haunted me—especially after Isabella's return. I'd believed it was our second chance. How wrong I'd been.

Isabella and I were fundamentally different now. We'd never work—even if we'd gotten together years earlier, there were no guarantees.

She'll always hold a piece of my heart as my first love. But the truth was undeniable—that love was dead. Had been for years.

###Chapter 73

My mind reeled from the shocking realization. I'd always believed my love for Isabella was unshakable. Discovering it wasn't... that revelation was tearing me apart.

I moved swiftly, dropping onto the bench beside Liam. More than anything, I wanted this nightmare to end. My skin prickled with unease, my pulse erratic.

"What were you talking about with Isabella?" Liam demanded the second I sat down.

The venom in his voice was unmistakable. No one needed to be told twice—the woman I'd once vowed to spend my life with was the person he despised most.

That hatred was part of why I'd hesitated with Isabella. How could I be with her when my son loathed her? How could I consider a future when she clearly didn’t like him either?

From the things she'd said, it was obvious she resented him—for being Sophia's son, for being the reason I married her. Maybe both.

"Nothing important," I muttered, lost in thought.

Silence stretched between us until he spoke again. His words made my fists clench.

"I have a best friend now. Like you and Uncle Sebastian have Uncle Nathan," he announced.

"That's good."

I wasn’t in the mood for conversation. My mood had soured. But Liam, oblivious, kept talking.

"His name is Oliver. They moved in next door last week."

I nodded absently. It wasn’t that I didn’t care—I just had too much on my damn mind. And at the center of it all was his mother.

"You know," he paused, smirking, "his dad is really good-looking."

That caught my attention. I turned to him, finally noticing the mischief in his grin.

"They’ve been over to our house. While Oliver and I played, Mom and Mr. Montgomery were downstairs talking and eating cupcakes. He even promised to help her plant the vegetable garden."

What the hell? Who was this Lucas guy? Why would Sophia invite a stranger into her home, knowing the Slades were still a threat?

He continued, smirking triumphantly, as if he hadn’t just unleashed a storm inside me.

"He made her laugh. A lot. When we came down for dinner, they were standing close while setting the table."

Every word fueled my fury. My jaw locked to keep from snapping at my own son. My heart pounded, rage crashing over me in waves.

"I was worried about Mom when you married Isabella," he said casually. "But now that Lucas is around, you can go ahead. I still don’t like her, but you can marry her, and Mom can marry Lucas. He makes her happy, and Oliver would be my brother—bonus."

Then, with a devilish grin, he delivered the final blow.

"Maybe we can get more siblings. We’ll have to ask them first, but I’m sure they’ll agree."

I snapped.

"Liam!" I slammed my hand on the picnic table.

Everyone turned, confusion on their faces. This was the first time I’d ever yelled at him.

"What?" he asked innocently, as if he hadn’t just lit a fire inside me.

Instead of cowering, he stood, flashed me a smug grin, and walked away—straight toward my mother and Victoria.

"What was that about?" Sebastian asked, dropping beside me. Nathan joined seconds later.

I was still seething. The image of Sophia laughing with another man burned in my mind, tearing at me in ways I didn’t understand.

When I was around her, she barely smiled. If she did, it was cold. The thought of someone else making her laugh? Unbearable.

"Yeah, what did Liam say to piss you off?" Nathan asked, curious.

"Just that their new neighbor is cozying up to Sophia. Making her laugh," I ground out, fists tightening.

Sebastian and Nathan exchanged glances before laughing. I didn’t care. My mind was chaos.

I needed to hit something. All I saw was red.

A primal part of me roared that she was mine. That no other man should dare touch her.

The intensity shocked me. I’d never thought of her as mine. She was just Sophia—the woman who’d ruined my life.

"He’s trying to make you jealous," Sebastian said once their laughter faded. "He wants you and Sophia back together. Your reaction just proved you care. A lot."

I glared at him. I wanted to deny it, but I couldn’t. If I was honest, I was jealous. Brutally so.

I wanted Sophia to smile at me. To laugh with me. I wanted to be the one in her house, setting the damn table. Hell, I wanted to kneel in the dirt beside her, planting that garden.

The realization froze me. I was Ethan Blackwood. Yet here I was, willing to grovel just to be near her.

"Are you in love with Sophia?" Nathan asked seriously.

The question stunned me. I had no answer. How could I explain this confusion? These feelings were foreign, overwhelming.

Why now? Why not years ago?

The questions pounded in my skull. And I had no answers.

I stood abruptly, ignoring the questioning looks from my parents, Liam’s triumphant smirk, and Victoria’s confusion.

I needed air. Space to think.

But inside, I found no peace.

Isabella sat alone in the living room.

She jumped up when she saw me.

"Please, Ethan, talk to me. Tell me how to fix this," she begged.

I hated hurting her. But giving her false hope was worse.

"You can’t fix it, Isabella," I said, running a hand through my hair. "I don’t want to hurt you, but our love ran its course."

"Are you saying you don’t love me? That you love Sophia instead?" Her face shattered.

Just like with Nathan and Sebastian, I walked away.

As night fell, one question haunted me.

If I didn’t love Isabella... did that mean I loved my ex-wife?
###Chapter 74

The weekend had been perfect. Nothing extraordinary happened, but I cherished every moment with Eleanor and Alexander.

They were everything I'd wished Victoria and William could have been—warm, affectionate, and present. Instead, my birth parents had been distant, their love reserved only for Isabella and Nathan.

Hell, they’d even treated Sebastian and Ethan Blackwood better than me, despite insisting I was their daughter.

The more time I spent with Eleanor and Alexander, the deeper my love for them grew. Being around them made me understand why Daniel adored them so much. The way he spoke of them, with such reverence and tenderness—now I got it. They were extraordinary, and no one needed convincing.

"Where the hell is she?" Natalie huffed, snapping me out of my thoughts.

We were at a café, waiting for Amelia, who, as usual, was late. The woman worked as a secretary, yet she had zero concept of time.

"She’ll show. Probably stuck in traffic," I mumbled around a bite of my blueberry muffin.

My pregnancy cravings had officially taken over. Right now, all I wanted were muffins and cupcakes—breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Everything else tasted like cardboard.

"We agreed on two o'clock," Natalie grumbled, irritation twisting her flawless features.

I smirked at her frustration. "You’ll learn that Amelia operates on her own schedule. Accept it now, and you’ll save yourself a lot of headaches."

She exhaled sharply, clearly annoyed. Natalie was the type who’d rather arrive an hour early than a second late.

As she stewed, I devoured another muffin. Hunger gnawed at me constantly these days.

With Liam, my first pregnancy had been brutal. No anti-nausea meds worked, and I didn’t get relief until well into my sixth month.

That’s why Ethan’s abandonment cut so deep. While I was barely surviving, he was too busy pining over Isabella to notice I was wasting away.

I’d been hospitalized multiple times because my doctor feared for Liam’s and my health.

I understood he was heartbroken over losing Isabella, but seriously? Did that excuse neglecting his unborn child?

Shaking off the bitterness, I focused on Natalie. She was tapping her foot impatiently.

"What’s wrong?" I finally asked when her agitation became unbearable.

"I had a business proposal for you and Amelia, but since she’s MIA, I’ll just tell you now because I’m losing my mind," she admitted.

"Okay…?"

"It’s unconventional. Not the kind of venture people in our circles usually consider."

That piqued my interest. If Natalie thought it was unconventional, it had to be wild.

"Go on."

"I want us to start a sex toy company," she deadpanned.

I choked on my muffin. "Excuse me?"

"A sex toy company," she repeated, unfazed. "Think about it. The market’s booming. Seventy percent of women own at least one, single or not. Even men are embracing them to spice things up."

I gaped at her.

"What’s got Sophia so stunned?" Amelia’s voice chimed in as she slid into the booth.

I hadn’t even noticed her arrival—that’s how shocked I was.

Amelia glanced between us. "What did I miss?"

"Natalie just suggested we launch a sex toy line," I said flatly.

I expected Amelia to share my disbelief. Instead, her eyes lit up.

"That’s genius!" she squealed.

"Are you both insane?" I demanded.

"Name one woman who doesn’t own a pleasure toy," Natalie challenged.

"I don’t."

They both stared at me like I’d sprouted a second head.

"Seriously?" Amelia gasped.

"Never had one, never wanted one."

I’d considered it once, but my sex life with Ethan hadn’t exactly been… collaborative. For him, it was about release. For me, it was about filling the emotional void between us.

"We should do this," Amelia declared. "But since Sophia’s a newbie, she should test the top brands and give us unbiased feedback."

Natalie nodded eagerly. "Perfect. Her fresh perspective will help us innovate."

"Hold on—do I get a say in this?" I snapped.

"Not really," Amelia said breezily. "We’re about to make you filthy rich, so…"

"I’m already filthy rich."

She shrugged. "Then consider it a fun challenge. You said you wanted something new, right?"

I groaned. How bad could it be?

"Fine," I relented.

They squealed and crushed me in a hug, nearly suffocating me. Their excitement was contagious, stirring something in me I hadn’t felt in ages. Maybe this would be fun.

"Now that that’s settled," Amelia said, pulling back, "I have a question for you, Sophia."

I raised a brow. "Shoot."

"Who’s Callum Montgomery?"

I stiffened. I hadn’t mentioned him to anyone.

"My new neighbor. How do you know about him?"

"Nathan told me," she said, and my confusion deepened. "Apparently, at the family dinner, Liam mentioned him. Said Callum makes you happy and he wouldn’t mind if you married him and gave him more siblings. Nathan said Ethan looked ready to murder someone."

"No way," Natalie breathed.

"Oh, yes. According to Nathan, Ethan nearly shattered the table in jealousy."

I burst out laughing so hard my stomach cramped.

The idea of Ethan being jealous was ludicrous. If there was one man who wouldn’t care if I slept with the entire male population, it was him.

"That’s a joke, right?" I wheezed.

Ethan had only ever been jealous over Isabella. Not me. Never me.

"Nathan’s starting to question Ethan’s feelings for you," Amelia pressed.

"Why is that so hard to believe?" Natalie asked.

"Because I know him. He was probably just pissed Liam keeps pushing us to reconcile." I turned to Amelia. "And tell Nathan there’s nothing going on. When Isabella came back, he begged me not to interfere with their ‘happily ever after.’ I haven’t."

"I think he’s realizing he might’ve been wrong about you two," Amelia murmured.

I remembered Nathan’s warning at the hospital after Isabella returned. He’d been terrified I’d ruin her fairytale ending.

"The only thing Ethan Blackwood ever felt for me was hatred. Nothing will change that. What you’re suggesting is delusional."

"Not if those feelings were always there, buried," Natalie countered.

I shook my head, irritation flaring. "Drop it, Amelia. Even if Ethan magically developed feelings, it’s too late now."

Silence fell. The mood soured, and suddenly, I just wanted to go home.

Why couldn’t they let this go? Ethan was my past. He’d stay there.

My future was my children, my foundation, and this absurd new business.

Nothing would change that.
###Chapter 75

My fingers tap nervously against the desk as Harrison flips through the business proposal Natalie sent over.

I have to give her credit—the woman works at lightning speed. Less than twenty-four hours since we brainstormed the idea, and she already had a full proposal drafted.

Either she was that efficient, or she had been sitting on this idea for a while, just waiting for Amelia and me to agree.

Harrison’s expression is unreadable as he scans the document. He’s been more than just my lawyer—he’s been my most trusted advisor since I made my first million. I never sign a deal without his approval.

His track record is flawless. Every venture he greenlit has thrived, and every one he warned me against has crashed and burned. So, yeah, his opinion matters.

A lot.

“Well?” I finally ask when the silence stretches too long.

He exhales, setting the papers down. “It’s a solid concept. The market potential is undeniable.”

I know him too well. There’s a but coming.

“But?” I prompt.

His gaze sharpens. “It’s unconventional. And given your position as the face of Hope Foundation, there’s a reputational risk.”

I frown. “Explain.”

He leans forward. “Sophia, you’ve built a brand around philanthropy and child welfare. A sex toy company—even a high-end, luxury one—might not align with that image. Some donors could pull funding if they associate you with this.”

My stomach sinks.

Damn it. He’s right.

I slump back in my chair, frustration bubbling up. I’d been hesitant at first, but the idea had grown on me. Starting something bold and fun with my friends? It sounded exhilarating.

But Harrison’s words echo in my head. Reputation. Image. Donors.

I sigh. “So, that’s it? I have to back out?”

His lips quirk. “Not necessarily.”

I raise a brow.

“You could be a silent partner,” he suggests. “Invest capital, take a share of profits, but stay out of the public eye. Only the core team would know.”

A slow grin spreads across my face.

That… could work.

“I’ll talk to Amelia and Natalie,” I say, already reaching for my phone.

Harrison stands, gathering his files. “Let me know their thoughts. I’ll draft the paperwork accordingly.”

“Thanks, Harrison.”

He smirks. “You pay me enough to justify it.”

The moment he’s gone, I dial Amelia.

She answers on the first ring.

“Sophia, I—” Her voice cracks. “I’m so sorry.”

I blink. “For what?”

“For pushing you about Ethan. I just… I want you to be happy, and I thought—”

I cut her off with a sigh. “Amelia, we’ve been over this.”

“I know, but—”

“No.” My tone is firm. “I’ll say this once, and then we’re done. I loved Ethan. A part of me probably always will. But love isn’t enough when it’s poisoned by years of cruelty. I buried that feeling to survive. And it’s staying buried.”

Silence. Then a quiet sniffle.

“I’m sorry,” she whispers.

“I know you mean well. But Ethan isn’t my happiness. And frankly? I’m done with men.”

She lets out a watery laugh. “Right. Hence the sex toy empire.”

I grin. “Exactly. Speaking of which…”

I fill her in on Harrison’s suggestion. As expected, she’s immediately on board.

“Makes total sense. Natalie will agree too.”

“Good. Oh, and—did you buy the stuff we recommended?”

I groan. “I was about to head to the mall.”

“Go. Your feedback is vital.”

After hanging up, I shower, change, and drive to the upscale shopping center, my pulse racing the entire way.

This is insane.

Me? Shopping for those kinds of products?

But I follow Natalie’s directions to her favorite boutique, tucked discreetly in a quieter corner of the mall.

I hesitate outside the door, debating whether to bolt—

Then a deep, familiar voice freezes me in place.

“Sophia?”

My stomach drops.

No. No, no, no.

I turn slowly.

Ethan Blackwood stands there, looking just as stunned as I feel.

What the hell is he doing here?
###Chapter 76

I spin around, my breath catching in my throat. Ethan Blackwood stands behind me, his presence like a sudden storm on a clear day.

Could this day get any worse? I groan inwardly, my fingers tightening around the strap of my purse.

"Ethan?" My voice comes out sharper than intended. "What the hell are you doing here?"

Of all the places, of all the moments—why now, when I'm frozen in front of a neon-lit sex shop? The universe must be laughing at me.

His lips quirk, eyes flickering past me to the display window. "I could ask you the same thing."

Heat floods my cheeks. There’s no way to explain this away. The shop’s window gleams with an array of vibrators, leather cuffs, and things I don’t even want to name.

I swallow hard, forcing my gaze back to him. "I was just... shopping for maternity clothes. And baby things."

His eyebrow arches. "In this store? Unless you're planning something very creative with those silicone toys, I don’t think you’ll find what you need here."

The amusement in his tone makes my stomach twist. Since when does Ethan Blackwood tease me?

I don’t dignify that with a response. Instead, I pivot on my heel and march away. But of course, he follows, matching my pace effortlessly.

"I didn’t take you for the type to use toys," he muses, voice low.

I stop dead in my tracks.

"First of all," I hiss, whirling on him, "you don’t know anything about me. You never bothered to. And second—what’s wrong with a woman taking care of her own needs? Or is that concept too shocking for your fragile ego?"

His eyes darken, but I don’t wait for a reply. I speed-walk away, my pulse hammering.

Just when I think I’ve lost him, his voice cuts through the air. "Sophia."

I halt, gritting my teeth. "What?"

He gestures to a boutique a few feet away. "Here’s a maternity store. Since that’s actually what you’re looking for."

Damn him.

Grudgingly, I stomp toward the shop, but the second he moves to follow, I throw my arm out. "What are you doing?"

"Isn’t it obvious?" He smirks. "Helping you shop."

"I don’t need your help. Turn around and walk away."

He doesn’t. Instead, he steps so close I can feel the heat of his body. "I’m staying. And you’re going to try on every damn dress in this store. Get used to it."

My jaw drops. The audacity.

Before I can unleash my fury, a cheerful voice interrupts. "Hello! How can I help you two today?"

Ethan answers before I can. "My wife needs maternity clothes."

Wife?!

I nearly choke. "I am not—"

But the clerk, Abigail, beams. "Right this way! We just got in some gorgeous pieces."

Ethan grabs my wrist, tugging me inside before I can correct her.

Seated on a plush sofa, I glare at him. "What the hell was that?"

He leans back, infuriatingly calm. "What was what?"

"Calling me your wife! Have you forgotten we’re divorced? Or that you’re with Isabella now?"

Abigail returns with an armful of dresses. "Let’s start with this one."

It’s a stunning maxi dress. If I weren’t seething, I’d admire it.

"Go try it on," Ethan orders.

I snatch the dress and storm to the fitting room.

The moment I slip it on, my anger fades. The fabric drapes perfectly over my curves, accentuating my baby bump. I love it.

I call Abigail for the next outfit—a breezy sundress that looks just as good.

But as I’m about to try on jeans, the door creaks open.

It’s not Abigail.

Ethan steps inside, holding a blue top. I freeze, clad only in my bra and panties.

"What the hell?" I whirl, trying to cover myself with the nearest dress.

His gaze drags over me, slow and deliberate. It feels like a touch, and it makes my skin prickle.

He drops the top and moves toward me, almost trance-like.

Before I can react, he cages me against the mirror. His breath is uneven, his eyes burning with something I refuse to name.

His fingers trace my lips, then my neck, before lingering on my cleavage.

"They’re bigger than I remember," he murmurs, voice rough.

"Back off," I whisper.

He doesn’t. His hand drifts lower, pushing the dress aside to rest on my stomach.

Our breaths sync—mine shallow, his ragged.

Then I see it.

Desire. Raw and undeniable.

I shove him away, my pulse roaring in my ears.

He blinks, as if snapping out of a dream.

"Sophia—"

"Don’t." I yank my clothes on and bolt.

Outside, I gulp the fresh air, my mind reeling.

Ethan Blackwood has never looked at me like that.

So why now?

And why did it feel like he wanted to devour me whole?
###Chapter 77
Ethan

Damn it!

I watch as Sophia flees from the boutique. Every fiber of my being screams to chase after her, but I know I've crossed a line.

The terror in her eyes was unmistakable. Yet in that moment, I'd been completely hypnotized. The sight of her nearly bare form short-circuited my brain.

I hadn't realized I'd moved until she shoved me away. Hadn't realized I'd backed her into a corner like some predator.

She was my wife, for God's sake. Yet she'd never affected me like this before. I'd seen her naked countless times, but today? Today was different.

Our sex life had been... functional. But I'd always held back. Back then, I was still clinging to Isabella. Every time I touched Sophia, guilt would choke me.

The early days of our marriage were the worst. I'd drown myself in whiskey after every encounter, trying to numb the self-loathing. Eventually, I learned to compartmentalize. To take what my body needed while locking away the guilt.

Even without love, I couldn't cheat. After witnessing my parents' disastrous marriage, I took my vows seriously. Countless opportunities presented themselves over the years, but I never succumbed.

I rake my hands through my hair, gripping the strands. The intensity of my desire moments ago had nearly brought me to my knees.

Her petite frame is burned into my retinas. The way her lace panties hugged her curves. The fantasy of pushing them aside and losing myself in her warmth.

Christ, I hadn't even seen her fully naked, yet I'm harder than I've ever been in my damn life. The whole situation terrifies me.

With another curse, I storm out. I need to escape—from the memories, from this all-consuming hunger.

I never shop at malls—all my clothes are custom-made. But today...

I never expected to see Sophia. Spotted her just as I was leaving the parking lot. She looked jumpy, furtive. Curiosity made me follow.

Now I wish I hadn't. She'll probably build another wall between us after this.

The drive to my parents' estate is a blur. My knuckles whiten on the steering wheel. That image of Sophia won't leave me.

"Finally! Did you get it?" My mother looks up from her seat in the sunroom.

I nod curtly, jaw clenched.

Mothers always know.

"Something's wrong," she states.

For once, I consider opening up. But how?

How do I explain that the woman we've despised for a decade now has me tied in knots? That she's all I think about?

That if Sophia hadn't stopped me, I would've taken her right there in that dressing room? That it wouldn't have been enough—I'd have carried her home and started all over again?

"Is this about the article?" Her question snaps me back.

"What article?"

She hands me her phone. A gossip piece published an hour ago:

[Ethan Blackwood spotted with ex-wife Sophia Sterling at upscale maternity boutique. Could divorcees be expecting baby number two? Sources say...]

I nearly crush the phone. Only four people knew about the pregnancy. Sophia will lose it when she sees this.

I make two calls. First to my media contact, demanding the article's removal. Second, a warning—any outlet publishing about Sophia's private life will face financial ruin.

"What's happening between you and Sophia?" My mother's gaze bores into me.

"I don't know," I growl.

"Victoria says you've cut contact with Isabella. That you ended things. Is this because of Sophia?"

I consider lying. What's the point?

"Partly."

Her sharp inhale says everything. I can't meet her eyes.

"Did you know Sophia wasn't William and Victoria's biological daughter?"

"Yes."

"Is that why you hated her?"

"No." Her answer surprises me. "I hated what she did to you. You loved Isabella so deeply, and Sophia's obsession destroyed that. Watching my son become a ghost of himself... It broke me, Ethan. We didn't get you back until Liam was born, and even then..."

I shake my head, unwilling to revisit that darkness.

"But now?" She continues softly. "I saw those photos. The way you looked at her... Like she hung the stars."

"Sebastian proved she was telling the truth about being drunk that night," I deflect.

The weight of what I did to Sophia crushes me. All the pain I caused until she finally walked away.

"Then I owe her an apology," Mom says quietly.

Silence stretches between us.

"You need to tell her, Ethan. Nine wasted years is enough. Tell her before it's too late."

"How?" My voice cracks. "I don't even understand what I feel. She's... I can't think straight."

"Language," she chides gently. "You've hated her so long, those feelings are warring with new ones. That's the confusion. My advice? Don't push. I saw how she looked at you—that love is either gone or buried deep."

I leave more settled yet still restless.

As I drive toward my office, I finally admit the truth:

I have feelings for Sophia. Powerful ones. Now I need to figure out exactly what they are—and what to do about them.
###Chapter 78

The moment my parents appeared on my doorstep, I knew they’d seen the damn article.

Amelia had sent me the link minutes after I got home. It infuriated me more than I already was. I hadn’t been ready to share the news, and those vultures had plastered it across the entire internet.

I wasn’t worried about the public’s reaction. My only concern was my parents. I hadn’t found the right way to tell them I was pregnant. The situation was already complicated enough with Daniel still refusing to speak to them.

The article vanished just before my parents arrived. I had a strong suspicion Ethan had something to do with it.

Just thinking his name ignited a fury like no other. I shook off the memory of what happened in the changing room and focused on my parents, who were staring at me with unspoken questions.

"You saw the article, didn’t you?" I asked, stating the obvious.

The house was quiet, mostly because Liam wasn’t back from school yet.

"Yes," Dad answered, his gaze piercing.

"Sophia, we know we haven’t spent much time together lately, but why didn’t you tell us?" Mom whispered, her voice fragile. "A baby is a blessing. I thought we were past the point where you felt you couldn’t talk to us."

Her hurt cut deep. It pained me to know I’d caused them pain. They’d been nothing but incredible to me—the kind of parents I’d always dreamed of. How could I explain that I wanted to tell them, but the words just wouldn’t come?

"You have to believe me—I wanted to tell you so many times. I just didn’t know how," I murmured, staring at my trembling hands.

"Why would you struggle to tell us?" Dad’s brows furrowed in confusion. He was searching for a reason, but none seemed to make sense.

"Because of who the father is."

Mom gasped sharply. "You mean Ethan isn’t the father?"

Why did everyone assume Ethan was the one who got me pregnant? We’d been divorced, for God’s sake.

I nodded, still avoiding their eyes. Back then, I hadn’t known the truth, but the fact remained—I’d slept with my adopted brother. I was sure Daniel had never shared those details with them, which made this confession even harder. And it was even more twisted that Daniel had known the truth the whole time and still went through with it.

"Sophia, we would never judge you," Mom said softly, seeing my hesitation. "Whoever the father is, it doesn’t matter."

"Even if the father is Daniel?" The words choked out of me.

It still felt like a sin. Daniel and I weren’t related by blood, but in every other way, he was their son.

The silence that followed was suffocating. They both stared at me in stunned disbelief, mouths opening and closing without sound.

Damn it. I knew this was a mistake. What if they hated me? What if they hated Daniel? I exhaled shakily. But I couldn’t keep this secret forever.

"D-Daniel is the father?" Mom stammered, tears welling in her eyes.

"Yes. I didn’t know he was my adopted brother when we got involved."

"But he knew!" Dad roared, surging to his feet, his face flushed with anger. "Is this why he refuses to see us? I never thought he’d sink this low—seducing you when he knew you were our daughter!"

I was stunned. I’d never heard Dad curse before.

"He didn’t seduce me. I entered the relationship willingly," I said, my cheeks inexplicably heating.

Sure, I wouldn’t have gotten involved if I’d known the truth, but he hadn’t manipulated me. Everything between us had been consensual.

"He deceived you, Sophia," Mom sighed. "Your father’s right. Daniel knew the truth, but you didn’t. He took advantage of that. What he did was wrong. So wrong."

"I know," I whispered, disgust coiling in my stomach. "He won’t be in prison forever. And I did give him a chance to explain himself, but he refused. Now I have to live with this—with the fact that my child’s father is my adopted brother. How do I explain that to my baby one day?"

Mom stood and pulled me into a tight embrace. Tears pricked my eyes.

Damn hormones.

"It’s okay, sweetheart. Don’t worry. We still love you, and we’ll love this baby just as much," Dad said, joining us.

We stayed like that for a long moment before finally pulling apart.

"Another grandbaby!" Mom suddenly beamed, her entire face lighting up. "This is wonderful! I need to start shopping!"

She bounced on her toes like an excited teenager.

"Who else can say they’re a grandmother at forty-three? I’m young, stylish, and still energetic enough to chase after my grandkids!"

Dad and I laughed as she twirled around the living room like a ballerina. Dad caught her, spun her in his arms, and kissed her, making her giggle.

I smiled, but a pang struck my heart. This was the kind of love I’d always wanted. The kind of marriage I’d dreamed of. But I’d let go of those fantasies. I’d accepted that kind of love wasn’t meant for me.

They stayed a little longer before leaving. A weight had lifted from my shoulders. My biggest fear had been their rejection, but seeing their excitement soothed something inside me.

Later, Liam came home, and I busied myself helping him with homework and making snacks. I liked staying organized, so I laid out his uniform and everything he’d need for the next day.

Just as I finished, there was a knock at the door.

I trudged to answer it.

"Sophia Sterling?" the deliveryman asked.

Ugh. I need to change my last name. Sterling didn’t belong to me anymore.

"Yes?"

"Delivery for you."

I rolled my eyes. Why did they always state the obvious?

"I didn’t order anything."

"Not my problem."

Rude. Maybe he’d seen my eye roll. Before I could respond, he shoved a box into my hands and walked away.

I stared after him, memorizing the company name. I hadn’t ordered anything, but I would be leaving a scathing one-star review.

Taking the box inside, I set it on the coffee table.

"What’s that?" Liam asked, eyeing it curiously.

"No idea."

I hesitated. With the Reapers still a threat, what if it was dangerous?

Before I could overthink it, Liam snatched the box and tore it open.

"Liam!" I shrieked, my heart leaping into my throat.

If it had been a bomb, we’d be dead. Did he have no sense of self-preservation?

"You never open unknown packages!" I snapped, trying to calm my racing heart.

He shrugged. "I was curious."

Peering inside, his face twisted in disappointment. "I thought it’d be something cool. It’s just a bunch of dresses."

Wait—what?

I took the box and pulled out the contents. One by one, I recognized them—the outfits I’d loved at the maternity boutique. The ones I’d wanted to buy before Ethan ruined everything.

How the hell—?

Then it hit me. Ethan. That bastard must have bought them.

"They’re pretty, Mommy. You’ll look beautiful," Liam said, just as the thought of burning them crossed my mind.

"Thanks, sweetheart," I forced a smile. "Go finish your homework. I’ll start dinner."

Leaving the clothes, I headed to the kitchen, unsure what to do with them. I didn’t want anything from Ethan. Honestly, this was the first gift he’d ever given me.

Thinking of the clothes brought back the memory of the changing room. I still didn’t understand what had gotten into him. He’d been acting so unlike himself.

I hated the hunger in his eyes. Hated how I’d felt his hardness pressed against me. Ethan had never found me attractive. Never looked at me like he wanted to devour me. So what the hell had changed?

"Sophia."

I spun around at his voice. He stood in the kitchen doorway, watching me.

"What are you doing here? How did you get in?" My anger flared.

"Liam let me in," he said, stepping closer.

I didn’t want him in my house. In my life. He didn’t get to treat me like garbage for years and suddenly have a change of heart. That’s not how this worked.

"Get out," I snapped.

"Sophia—"

"Get the hell out of my house, Ethan."

I tried to hold back, but the memories of his cruelty surged forward.

"Listen to me—"

"Like you listened when I told you I was drunk and you didn’t believe me? Or when I begged for a chance, and you ignored me?" I took a sharp breath, forcing myself to stay calm.

"I’ve heard enough from you to last a lifetime. I left you like you always wanted. Why can’t you do the same? Haven’t I suffered enough for loving you? What else do you want from me?"

Tears burned, but I refused to let them fall. I wouldn’t give him the satisfaction.

"You’ve always thrown Isabella in my face. She’s here, Ethan. You can have the love of your life and leave me the hell alone. Don’t come to my appointments. Don’t take me shopping. Don’t buy me clothes. Just ignore me like you always have."

I slumped against the counter, exhausted. Something flickered in his eyes—pain? Regret? I didn’t care.

"Are you guys fighting?" Liam’s voice cut through the tension.

His expression was hard, lips pressed into a thin line.

"No," I sighed. "Your father was just leaving."

I glared at Ethan, silently demanding he go. Hopefully, he’d never step foot in my home again.

Liam nodded and left. Ethan turned to go but paused.

"I’m sorry, Sophia. So damn sorry," he said, his voice rough with emotion.

"Just leave. And take those clothes with you."

"No."

I clenched my fists, resisting the urge to hurl a pan at his head.

"Fine. I’ll donate them."

"Do what you want. They’re yours." With that, he walked out.

A moment later, I heard murmurs, then the front door closed. Relief washed over me as his suffocating presence disappeared.

As I cooked dinner, I fortified the walls around my heart. Whatever game Ethan was playing, I wouldn’t fall for it again. I’d be damned before I let him hurt me one more time.
###Chapter 79

The weight of the morning pressed down on me like a lead blanket. My mood was sour, and the reason was no mystery—Liam was still upset with me for sending Ethan away. I had thought my excuses were convincing, but apparently, my son saw right through them.

Sometimes, I wished we had never pretended in front of him. We thought we were protecting him, giving him the illusion of a happy family. Instead, all we did was lie.

Now, Liam was convinced that Ethan and I had once been in love—and worse, that we could be again.

How was I supposed to tell him the truth without shattering his little heart? How could I explain that everything he believed about Ethan and me was a carefully constructed lie?

My greatest fear was that he would hate us for deceiving him. But we couldn’t keep this up. We couldn’t let him cling to false hope.

With a heavy sigh, I dragged myself out of bed. I had gone back to sleep after Liam left for school, but exhaustion clung to me like a second skin. These days, my growing belly made every movement sluggish.

I shuffled to the bathroom and stepped under the shower, hoping the water would wash away the fatigue. It didn’t.

Dressing was another chore. I settled on a white spaghetti-strap sundress dotted with blue flowers, the hem brushing just above my knees. No more hiding—my parents knew about the pregnancy now, and I was done pretending.

Makeup? Too much effort. A swipe of concealer under my tired eyes was all I managed before heading downstairs.

The doorbell rang just as I reached the foyer.

I wasn’t in the mood for visitors. Not today. Not when I felt like this.

Still, I opened the door—and immediately regretted it.

Nathan stood on my doorstep, disheveled and worn.

I moved to slam the door in his face, but he caught it before I could.

"Please, Sophia," he begged, his voice ragged.

"What do you want?" My tone was ice, even to my own ears.

It was almost funny how easily my voice turned cold these days. No effort required. Just instant detachment, as if I were speaking to a stranger.

"Can I come in?"

"Absolutely not. Say what you came to say and leave."

I wasn’t going to pretend I wasn’t curious. The last time I’d seen Nathan was when Mother had dropped the bombshell about my true parentage.

He hesitated, and my curiosity sharpened. Nathan had always been arrogant, self-assured. Seeing him nervous was… intriguing.

"Spit it out already! I don’t have all day," I snapped when the silence stretched too long.

Why was I even entertaining this? I should’ve called the police the second I saw him.

"I was wondering if you could talk to Eleanor and Alexander," he finally said, so quietly I had to strain to hear.

"About what?"

"Sharp Corp." His voice cracked. "They’ve gone after us. Convinced every investor in their network to drop us. The company is sinking, Sophia. We’re losing everything—investors, clients, funds."

I exhaled slowly. Honestly, I’d thought Mom and Dad’s threat was just that—a threat. I never imagined they’d actually dismantle the Sharps for what they’d done to me.

But if there was one thing Nathan loved more than anything, it was that company. His pride. His legacy. For him to come here, practically begging, meant he was desperate. Out of options.

"You know I don’t care if that company burns to the ground, right?" I crossed my arms.

He looked exhausted. Like a man who hadn’t slept in weeks.

Amelia hadn’t mentioned any of this to me. Then again, I’d told her never to bring Nathan up in my presence.

"Please, Sophia. I’m begging you. We’re family."

That word sent a spike of fury through me.

"Family?" I scoffed. "How, Nathan? If I remember correctly, you cut me off. You said I was dead to you. You renounced me as your sister years ago. And then you proved it—every time you took Isabella’s side, every time you treated me like garbage. Every damn time you laughed when Ethan tore my heart out because I’d hurt your precious sister—did you think of me as family then?"

He said nothing. What could he say? He knew the truth. To him, to all of them, I had been nothing. An inconvenience.

"So tell me—if I wasn’t family then, why should you be now? That card doesn’t work on me anymore."

Our eyes locked. I used to study the differences between us. Nathan and Isabella didn’t look alike, but you could tell they were related. Me? I never fit. That should’ve been my first clue.

"Let’s be honest. You never cared about me. The only reason you’re here is because you think you can use me. But I won’t let you. Go home, Nathan. And don’t ever come back."

I shoved him back and slammed the door so hard the frame rattled. Leaning against it, I sucked in sharp breaths.

A few minutes later, his car roared to life and sped away.

I needed air. Needed to escape.

Grabbing my keys, I headed for the door—then paused at the sight of the clothes Ethan had bought. On impulse, I snatched them up. Maybe I’d drop them at a shelter on my way.

Within minutes, I was on the road, my mind a storm. First Ethan, now Nathan. The audacity of them, thinking they could waltz back into my life and demand things. As if the past could just be erased.

If Ethan weren’t Liam’s father, I’d have cut him out completely. Everything I did was for Liam. I’d been tempted so many times to take him far away—but his love for his father always stopped me.

I wanted to move. To start fresh. But I knew it would break Liam’s heart. Ethan thought Liam loved me more. He didn’t realize the boy adored him just as much.

Spotting an ice cream shop, I pulled over. The front was packed, so I parked in the back instead.

Comfort food. That’s what I needed.

Inside, the shop was cozy, the air sweet with sugar. I ordered a massive bowl of vanilla—my go-to when I needed solace.

My thoughts circled back to Nathan. I wasn’t sure how I felt about revenge. Part of me wanted to watch them crumble. The other part just wanted to forget they existed.

Was it wrong that the vengeful side was winning?

I finished my ice cream no clearer than when I’d started. Maybe my therapist could help me sort this out.

Decision made, I headed for my car—but never reached it.

A hand clamped over my mouth and nose.

I barely had time to struggle before darkness swallowed me whole.
###Chapter 80

"Wake up!"

I groan but keep my eyes shut. The voice sounds distant, like a fading dream—except dreams don’t usually sound this irritatingly familiar.

"Sophia, wake the hell up!"

My eyes snap open. That voice was too sharp, too real to be imagined. And why the hell would I dream about her of all people?

Blinking, my vision swims as I try to adjust. Then it hits me—the memories flooding back.

Shit. I’ve been kidnapped. Again.

My head throbs, probably from whatever chemical they used to knock me out. Chloroform, if I had to guess. My hand instinctively moves to my stomach, panic flaring. Please don’t let this hurt the baby.

I’m tied to a chair, wrists bound so tightly the ropes bite into my skin. Testing them proves useless—whoever did this wasn’t taking chances.

"Are you done?"

I freeze. That wasn’t my imagination. Jerking my head to the side, I find Isabella—also tied up, but looking far more alert than I feel.

"What the hell are you doing here?" I blurt.

Scanning the room, I take in the barren space—no furniture, no windows, nothing but concrete walls and the two of us. No clues, no hints. Just emptiness.

"Isn’t it obvious?" she drawls. "We were both taken."

I roll my eyes. "No shit. I meant why? Who the hell would want us both?"

The list of enemies wasn’t short, but Isabella was the Sharp family’s golden child. If anyone was a target, it should’ve been her alone.

"I don’t know," she mutters.

"How long have you been here?" I force my breathing to steady. Panicking won’t help.

The question drags me back to another night—another kidnapping. The night Daniel betrayed me. The parallels make my stomach twist.

"Not sure. I woke up right before they dumped you in here," Isabella says, pulling me from the memory.

"And how long was I out?"

"Fifteen, twenty minutes?"

Silence. I do the math, but it’s useless. No idea how far we are from the ice cream shop.

Then it hits me—Liam. School ends at three-thirty. What if they took him too?

Breathe. The school would call Ethan if I didn’t show. He’d keep Liam safe.

I repeat it until my pulse slows. Liam would be okay. Right now, I needed to focus.

"So it’s true," Isabella says, eyeing my stomach. "You’re pregnant."

I ignore her, turning away. My pregnancy was none of her damn business.

She huffs. "Still rude as ever."

"And you’re still insufferable. Shut up."

I twist against the ropes, ignoring the burn in my wrists. No way was I staying trapped here with her.

A deep laugh cuts through the tension. "Nothing like a good catfight."

I jerk my head up. A man stands in the doorway—tall, built, smirking like he’s enjoying the show.

"Untie me," I snap. "Then we’ll see who’s laughing."

He chuckles. "Feisty. I like that."

I glare. "Is this your hobby? Kidnapping women? Does it make you feel like a real man?"

His smirk vanishes. "Shut your mouth."

"Or what?" I taunt.

"Sophia, stop," Isabella hisses.

I don’t. "Men like you are pathetic. Drugging women? Should’ve been castrated at birth."

His fist moves before I see it.

Pain explodes across my face. My vision whites out, ears ringing. Blood fills my mouth—I must’ve bitten my tongue.

When the world refocuses, I spit the blood onto his boots. He snarls, raising his hand again—

"Enough."

A new voice. Smooth, commanding.

The brute freezes. "Boss, she—"

"I don’t care. You don’t touch them."

The newcomer steps forward, and my breath catches.

Tattoos coil over his arms, but they don’t hide the sharp cut of his jaw, the piercing green eyes, the kind of lips that belonged in a damn romance novel. Confidence rolls off him in waves—the kind that could rival Ethan’s.

Isabella’s staring too. Apparently, I wasn’t the only one struck stupid.

He turns to me, smiling. "Let’s start over. I’m Damian."

My pulse kicks.

"And you’re here," he continues, "because your ex-husband owes me. And I always collect."
###Chapter 81

"Are you planning to sulk in that chair indefinitely?" Sebastian snaps, irritation lacing his tone.

I don’t dignify him with a response. My gaze remains fixed on the whiskey swirling in my glass, replaying how things unraveled so spectacularly with Sophia.

I’m not delusional enough to think she was being unreasonable. She reacted exactly as anyone would—someone who’s been betrayed repeatedly by the people she trusted most.

A visceral need claws at me to erase her pain. To undo every wound I inflicted. But how? When I’m the one who put them there in the first place.

"You can’t keep doing this, Ethan. If she’s made it clear she wants nothing to do with you, then back the hell off! Isabella’s throwing herself at you, for Christ’s sake. It’s not like you’re short on options," he mutters, dropping into the chair across from me.

I don’t acknowledge his idiocy. Instead, I level him with a glare. "If my mood offends you, the door’s right there."

He doesn’t get it. And I have zero interest in explaining. My entire being has rejected Isabella—rejected every woman who isn’t Sophia.

I used to despise her. Used to swear I’d never want her. Famous last words, because now she’s all I think about. She’s invaded my thoughts, my fantasies, every waking moment.

Karma’s a vicious bitch. The second I admit I want her, she’s already moved on—carrying another man’s child, no less.

I used to be the only man who’d ever touched her. The only one who knew her intimately. I took that for granted. Now, someone else knows the taste of her skin, and it guts me that Daniel gave her what I denied her during our marriage.

Shoving the thought aside, I stride to the floor-to-ceiling windows of my office. The idea of another man’s hands on her is torture. Pure, unrelenting agony.

Now I understand how she must’ve felt when I flaunted Isabella between us.

Fuck. How do I make her see I don’t want to hurt her? That I want to fix what I broke?

You want to fix it, but you still won’t admit you love her? A voice mocks. When will you realize you don’t go this far for a woman unless you’re in love with her?

I ignore it. Refuse to drown in the truth.

Yes, I feel something for Sophia. I don’t know when it started or how deep it runs. But even if I confessed it now, would she believe me? After nine years of cruelty?

The door swings open. I don’t turn.

"What’s got you in such a foul mood?" Sebastian grumbles.

I don’t need to look to know he’s talking to Nathan. We’ve been friends since diapers. We know each other’s tells better than our own.

"Sophia."

Her name whips me around. My focus locks onto Nathan.

He looks hollow. Exhausted. Defeated. The weight he’s lost in recent weeks is alarming.

"What happened?" My voice is rougher than I intend.

"I went to her for help with the company. She refused." He drags a hand down his face.

I’ve offered assistance, but he’s stubborn. The Prescotts kept their word—Sterling Corp is sinking. Without intervention, it’ll collapse within months.

Our company remains stable only because we rival the Prescotts in influence. Their withdrawal and the investor exodus barely dented us.

But I’m not naive. They’ll find another way to retaliate. And I won’t fight it. I deserve whatever hell they bring for what I did to their daughter.

"That’s why you’re so wrecked? Because she said no?" Sebastian asks, sympathy softening his tone.

Nathan exhales sharply. "No. It’s what she said after. That I wasn’t family. That I meant nothing to her."

I see the pain flash in his eyes, but I feel no pity. We were monsters to her. Her rejection is kinder than we deserve.

"What did you expect?" Sebastian mutters. "I keep asking you both that."

"I know. I don’t know why I keep hoping she’ll be the same. The old Sophia is gone. The only time you see traces of her is when she’s with Liam." Nathan slumps into a chair, defeated.

My phone rings, cutting through the tension. An unknown number. I almost ignore it, but something stops me.

"Didn’t I promise I’d make you pay?" The voice is chillingly familiar.

"What the hell do you want?" I snarl, patience nonexistent.

Damian Slade—better known as Reaper—chuckles. "Don’t you want to know who I have?"

I don’t rattle easily, but Reaper’s unhinged. His confidence sends a spike of dread through me.

"Spit it out. I don’t have time for games."

My tone is steady, but panic coils in my gut. He has someone I care about. And that thought alone is enough to unravel me.

"Since you’re so eager…" He pauses, savoring the torment. "I’ve got two lovely guests. The love of your miserable life… and the mother of your child."

My heart stutters. Stops. Then slams against my ribs like a wild thing. Sebastian and Nathan go silent, sensing the shift.

"What do you want?" My body is ice.

"Simple. Choose who lives and who dies. I’ll spare one and kill the other. Generous, no? You walk away with one instead of losing both."

Fuck. This is worse than I imagined. The man’s a psychopath.

"Tick-tock, Blackwood," he sing-songs before the line dies.

"What is it?" Sebastian demands, reading my expression.

"Damian has Sophia and Isabella." I force air into my lungs. "He’s making me choose."

"Jesus Christ!" Nathan explodes, his shout rattling the walls.

This is a nightmare.

I’ll move heaven and hell to save them both. But if it comes down to it… I already know my choice.

The real question is—can I live with the consequences?

###Chapter 82

"You can't be serious," Isabella whispers, her voice trembling as much as mine.

My pulse races wildly. Fear claws at my chest, making each breath a struggle. If I thought Damian Slade—or Reaper, whatever the hell he called himself—kidnapping us was bad, I was wrong. His plan was far worse.

"Oh, I am." Damian smirks, the cold amusement in his eyes sending ice through my veins. "Your father should never have crossed me. Neither should Ethan. It's time for my revenge."

He'd called Ethan right in front of us and forced him to choose. The sickening truth still hadn't sunk in—only one of us would leave this place alive.

The weight of it crushes me. Fear twists inside me, clouding my thoughts. My face throbs from Damian's earlier blow, my lip split and swollen. I focus on that pain instead of the horror looming over us.

"Nothing to say, Sophia?" Damian taunts, his smirk never fading.

I look away. Words fail me. This wasn't my first brush with death, but Damian's madness made survival feel impossible.

I shake myself internally. No. I refuse to think like that. I have Liam. I have a baby on the way. For them, I will fight.

"Maybe you're afraid Ethan will pick your sister," he muses. "Is that what's eating at you?"

"She's not my sister!" I snap, anger flaring.

His laugh is hollow. "No matter. This will be entertaining. I want to watch your ex-husband shatter. Whoever he chooses, the other dies—and the guilt will destroy him." With that, he leaves, the door slamming shut behind him.

"What do we do?" Isabella whispers.

I don’t answer.

Because Damian was right. I was afraid. Ethan had always chosen Isabella. That wouldn’t change now.

I had to escape. My parents would move heaven and earth to find me, but I couldn’t wait. If I stayed, I was dead.

Gritting my teeth, I twist against the ropes. My wrists burn, the fibers digging deeper with every movement. Blood trickles down my skin, but I don’t stop.

"What are you doing?" Isabella stares at me like I’ve lost my mind.

"Escaping," I hiss.

"But Ethan will come for us."

I scoff. "Wake up, Isabella. If it comes down to it, he’ll pick you. I have a son and a baby to think about. I’m not waiting around to die because our father was stupid enough to sign a deal with the devil."

Her mouth falls open. "How dare you—"

"I don’t care what you think," I snap. "Just shut up and let me focus."

She glares but stays silent.

Minutes pass. My hands shake, my skin raw and bleeding. It’s no use. I need another plan.

Swallowing my pride, I turn to her. "I need your help."

Her smirk is infuriating. "Now you want my help?"

"Are you going to be useful or not?"

She hesitates, then sighs. "What do you need?"

"If we turn our chairs back-to-back, maybe we can untie each other."

She nods, shifting her weight. The chair scrapes softly against the floor. After several attempts, we manage to position ourselves.

My fingers fumble with her knots. Every second stretches, the fear of Damian returning choking me.

Finally, the ropes loosen. I yank my hands free, then quickly untie my legs. My legs wobble, numb from lack of circulation.

Isabella stands, rubbing her wrists. "Now what?"

"Now we run."

I head for the door, but she doesn’t follow.

"What if Ethan comes and we're gone?"

I whirl on her. "If they find me missing, they’ll kill you on the spot. Stay if you want. I’m leaving."

She hesitates, then hurries after me.

The door creaks as I peek outside. No guards. We slip out into a junkyard—endless hiding spots, but no clear exit.

"We need to find a way out," I mutter.

We move silently, sticking to shadows. But the blare of an alarm shatters the quiet.

My heart stops.

They know.

"Go!" I grab Isabella’s arm, dragging her forward.

We sprint blindly, fear driving us. Then—

I crash into a solid figure.

Damien’s enforcer.

His grin is vicious as he raises a gun. "Did you really think you’d get away?"

I lift my chin. "Yes."

He steps closer, the barrel aimed at my chest. "Maybe I’ll just kill you now and spare Ethan the choice."

I don’t hesitate.

My knee slams into his groin. He howls, dropping the gun. I snatch it up, flick off the safety, and fire.

Once. Twice.

His screams echo.

But so do shouts. Footsteps.

"Run!" I shove Isabella behind a wrecked car as bullets fly.

She’s shaking, her voice high with panic. "This is your fault! If I die—"

A shadow moves beside us.

I barely have time to react before Isabella shoves me aside.

A gunshot rings out.
###Chapter 83

"Fuck!" The scream tore from Isabella's lips, jolting me out of my frozen shock just in time to see the man raise his pistol.

I lunged for the gun I'd dropped, fingers scrabbling against the cold metal. A single shot rang out. The man crumpled to the ground.

I didn’t spare him a glance—alive or dead, it didn’t matter. Not when adrenaline was roaring through my veins and Isabella was bleeding out in front of me.

Her breath hitched, tears spilling over. "I'm dying, aren't I?"

Normally, I’d tell her to stop being dramatic. But not now. Not when she’d shoved me aside and taken a bullet meant for me.

"No, you're not," I snapped, my hands already moving to assess the damage.

The wound was high on her shoulder, blood soaking through her shirt. Too much blood. My stomach twisted. If she bled out before we got help, or if the bastards hunting us found us first—

"You're lying!" she hissed as I pressed down hard on the wound. "If I'm not dying, why the hell does it feel like I am?"

I ignored her, ripping the hem of my dress to tie a makeshift bandage around her shoulder. The bullet was still lodged inside. Removing it here would only make things worse.

"Damn it," she groaned, glaring up at me through pain-glazed eyes. "I should've stayed in that fucking room."

"Too late for regrets," I muttered, hauling her up. "We have to move."

Fuck. Ethan was going to murder me. Not only had I dragged Isabella into this mess, but now she’d been shot protecting me.

Logically, it wasn’t my fault. She’d made the choice. But Ethan wouldn’t see it that way. One look at his precious sister bleeding in my arms, and I’d be the one to blame.

Isabella sagged against me, her steps growing heavier. How long had we been walking? Minutes? Hours? Time blurred into exhaustion. My legs burned, my hands shook, and my head pounded. Isabella was barely conscious now, her skin pale from blood loss.

"We need to stop," I gasped.

"Yesss," she slurred, swaying dangerously. "Good... idea."

I guided her to the rusted shell of an abandoned car, lowering her carefully before collapsing beside her. This place was a labyrinth. We’d been running in circles since we escaped, and now we were sitting ducks.

"Isabella," I said, voice rough. "I don’t think we’re getting out of here."

Silence.

I turned. Her eyes were closed, lips parted. Unconscious.

Panic clawed up my throat. I shook her, catching her before she toppled over. Her pulse was weak but there—thank God.

Tears burned my eyes. We were trapped. Isabella was fading. I was exhausted. And we were still deep in enemy territory.

A cold laugh cut through the silence.

"Tired of running?" A man stepped into view, gun gleaming in the dim light. "Or is your friend already dead?"

My blood turned to ice.

I’d said I didn’t care if they found us. I lied. I wasn’t ready to die.

"Please," I begged as he raised his weapon.

He wouldn’t kill me—Damien needed us alive. But that didn’t stop the terror coiling in my gut.

The safety clicked off.

"Boss wants you breathing," he sneered. "Doesn’t mean I can’t make you wish you weren’t."

His grin was pure malice. This wasn’t just a job for him. He enjoyed this.

I squeezed my eyes shut, bracing for pain.

A gunshot cracked.

But no pain came.

I opened my eyes—and there stood Ethan, an avenging shadow, the gunman dead at his feet.

"Ethan," I breathed.

His gaze flicked from me to Isabella’s limp form.

Dread pooled in my stomach.

"She needs an ambulance," I rushed out. "She was shot, lost consciousness—"

Ethan didn’t speak. His expression was stone.

And that terrified me more than anything.

Because when Isabella woke up and told him she’d taken a bullet for me?

Retribution would come.
###Chapter 84

The terror that gripped me when I saw that bastard pressing a gun to her temple was indescribable. Sophia trembled, tears streaking down her face. Her pleas for mercy echoed in my ears, but I knew Damien Slade wouldn’t spare her.

When she closed her eyes—resigned to her fate—it nearly shattered me. If not for her exhaustion, I would’ve kept the bastard alive just to make him suffer in ways he couldn’t imagine.

"She needs a doctor, Ethan," Sophia whispered as I knelt before her.

I’d already texted Sebastian. The ambulance was minutes away. It wasn’t that I didn’t care about Isabella—I did. But Sophia mattered more.

Cradling her face, I traced the swollen cheek, the bruised eye, the split lip. Rage coiled tight in my chest.

"Who hit you? Was it Damien?" My jaw clenched.

She flinched when my thumb brushed her injury. Fuck. Her pain twisted like a knife in my ribs. I wanted to tear apart the man who’d hurt her.

"It doesn’t matter. Isabella needs help," she insisted, trying to stand.

I gently pushed her back down, ignoring her protest. Her wrists were raw, her ankles swollen and purple. Every wound fueled my fury. She shouldn’t have endured this. Not while carrying our child.

"Ethan, are you even listening?" Her voice was frayed. If she weren’t so drained, she’d have cursed me out.

"I heard you. The ambulance is coming." My tone brooked no argument. "Now tell me who hurt you."

She exhaled, slumping against the car.

"One of Damien’s men. He hit me when I talked back."

"Describe him."

I’d find him. No one touched Sophia and walked away. He’d regret breathing.

"It’s over. When I escaped, he found us first. I kneed him in the groin and shot his thighs."

A smirk tugged at my lips. I loved this fiercer version of her—unwilling to take shit from anyone.

Before I could ask why she’d risked escaping, sirens wailed. Sebastian, Nathan, and paramedics arrived. They lifted Isabella onto a stretcher.

"What happened?" a medic asked.

Sophia hesitated. "She was shot during our escape. I tried to stop the bleeding, but she lost consciousness." Her gaze stayed fixed on Isabella. "Will she be okay?"

That was Sophia—worrying about someone who’d treated her horribly. An angel, even now.

"Her pulse is weak, but she’ll recover," the medic assured.

As they wheeled Isabella away, Nathan approached. "Are you alright, Sophia?"

"Yes," she murmured, swaying as she stood. "Go be with Isabella. She needs you."

He kissed her cheek—a gesture she’d normally reject—before leaving. I signaled Sebastian to follow.

"Need help?" I asked when she stumbled.

"Just to stand, not to be carried," she muttered, lacking her usual fire.

I ignored her, scooping her into my arms. Holding her felt right, like the universe had clicked into place.

Brian intercepted us. "Damien got away."

Rage simmered. "Find him," I snarled before carrying Sophia to the car.

"Where are we going?" she yawned.

"The hospital. You and the baby need checking."

She dozed off during the drive. At the ER, nurses rushed her inside.

"Call my parents," she murmured as they took her.

I did, then joined Nathan, Victoria, and Sebastian in the waiting room.

"Any news?" I asked.

"Not yet," Nathan said.

Victoria fretted. "Where’s Sophia?"

"Being examined," I replied.

Silence fell. This place dredged up memories—of William’s death, of seeing Isabella again after years apart. Of the shootout where I’d chosen Isabella over Sophia. That moment had changed her.

Now, pacing the room, I admitted the truth: I wanted Sophia. But my past actions stood between us. The love in her eyes was gone. She only tolerated me for Liam’s sake.

A nurse appeared. "Mr. Blackwood?"

"How is she?"

"Dehydrated, but otherwise fine. The baby’s healthy."

Behind me, Victoria gasped—she hadn’t known about the pregnancy.

"Can I see her?"

The nurse led me to Sophia’s room. IV lines snaked from her bandaged wrists, stitches marred her lip.

"Is Isabella okay?" she asked immediately.

Damn her kindness.

"No updates yet," I said, fighting the urge to hold her hand.

"I’m sorry," she whispered, tears welling. "I didn’t mean for her to get hurt. I just wanted to escape."

I gave in, clasping her hands. "Why did you run?"

She stared like I’d lost my mind. "Why stay? When Damien gave you the ultimatum, I knew you’d pick Isabella. I escaped to save our baby."

Her words gutted me. How could I blame her? I’d spent years proving Isabella came first.

Gripping her hand, I forced the truth out. "I was coming for you, Sophia. You were my choice."

Her eyes widened.

"I’d have let Isabella die to save you."

The shock on her face didn’t change my certainty. She’d been my priority for a long time. She owned me—even if she didn’t know it yet.
###Chapter 85

"W-what?" I stammer, staring at Ethan in utter disbelief.

There was no way I'd heard him right. The Ethan I knew would have moved heaven and earth for Isabella. He would have sacrificed me without hesitation.

My pulse races as I search his expression for any sign of deception.

"You heard me, Sophia," he repeats, his voice steady. "If it came down to it, I would have let her die to save you."

At first, I assumed he was lying to spare my feelings. Who wants to hear that the man they loved for nearly a decade would choose another woman over them?

I thought it was just empty comfort. But the raw honesty in his eyes told a different story. Since when had Ethan ever softened the truth for my sake? He'd never hesitated to remind me of my place before.

I exhale sharply and pull my hands from his grasp. The warmth of his touch was too much—too confusing. My mind was already spinning. I didn’t need his fingers tangled with mine making it worse.

"You don’t mean that," I say after a tense silence. "Isabella is the woman you've loved since you first understood what love was. You’ve been obsessed with her for years. How can you stand there and claim you’d sacrifice her for me?"

His jaw tightens. He opens his mouth to argue, but I cut him off.

"I’ve never meant anything to you. Remember? You hate me, Ethan. You’ve hated me for years. So what’s changed? How do you wake up one day and decide I matter more than your precious Isabella? None of this makes sense. You can’t just flip a switch and stop hating me."

I sink back against the pillow, exhausted. Every word I’d spoken was the truth. A decade of bitterness doesn’t vanish overnight.

People don’t change that easily. Not when the emotions run this deep. I knew that better than anyone. Hadn’t I spent years trying to suffocate my love for him? It didn’t just disappear.

He starts to speak, but I’m done. I don’t want to hear it. No pretty lies. No sudden revelations. I just want things to go back to the way they were—when their contempt was predictable.

Some might wonder why I’d prefer that. Isn’t this what I wanted? For them to realize their mistakes? To beg for forgiveness?

The truth is, I don’t know how to handle this version of them. Part of me wants to let go. The other part doesn’t trust it. Maybe it’s the years of rejection, but I can’t shake the feeling that this is another game—that the rug will be pulled out from under me any second.

"No, Ethan," I interrupt. "Thank you for saving me. But leave. Go to Isabella. That’s where you belong. You’ve waited years to be with her—don’t throw it away now. What we had meant nothing. It was a mistake. We made each other miserable for nine years. It’s time we both moved on. Your happiness has always been with her. And mine… mine is with my children now."

His stormy eyes darken, a silent argument brewing. I brace myself for his anger, but it never comes.

Instead, he exhales and leans back in the chair. "Fine. I’ll leave you alone… for now." His voice is rough as he stands.

I expect him to walk out, but he surprises me. He bends down, pressing a soft kiss to my forehead before I can react. Then he’s gone, the door clicking shut behind him.

I stare after him, stunned.

It’s not that I’m not relieved he left. I am. But Ethan never backs down. He does what he wants, when he wants. Yet he walked away because I asked—even when every line of his body screamed resistance.

As my strength returns, I replay his words. Believing him is impossible. This is Ethan. The same man who told me I’d never compare to Isabella. The same man who made sure I knew my place in his life.

How does he expect me to trust this sudden change?

For nine years, he—along with everyone else—made sure I knew I was nothing to him. Now he expects me to believe I matter?

The questions gnaw at me, but I push them aside. Whatever’s going on in his head isn’t my problem. We’re done. I don’t owe him my confusion.

Exhaustion pulls me under before I can dwell on it further.

When I wake, my parents are there, each holding one of my hands. The sight of them—their love so tangible—sends emotion surging through me.

This was what I’d craved from Ethan and the Sterlings. And now that I had it, the weight of it nearly undoes me.

"Ava," Mom whispers, her voice thick. "How are you feeling?"

Tears well up before I can stop them. "I love you both so much. Thank you… for being everything I ever needed."

Mom’s eyes shimmer. "Oh, darling. You have no idea how long I’ve waited to hear you say that."

"We love you, sweetheart," Dad murmurs. "More than you’ll ever know."

I let the tears fall, soaking in their embrace.

The nurse enters soon after, smiling. "Ready to be discharged, Sophia?"

Relief floods me. My baby was safe. The drugs hadn’t harmed them.

"Yes. I need to see my son," I say, my voice breaking.

Ethan had told me Liam was with his parents. I’d pick him up on the way home. The thought of holding him again makes my chest ache. Today could have ended so differently.

Once the nurse leaves, Mom helps me change. Dad insists on handling the paperwork, refusing to let me lift a finger.

As I wait, I spot the Sterlings—Nathan, Victoria, Sebastian… and Ethan.

Drawing a steadying breath, I approach them. It feels like high school all over again—the outcast walking toward the elite.

"I just wanted to ask about Isabella," I say, shifting uneasily.

Silence. Then Victoria stands and pulls me into a hug.

I freeze.

She’s never hugged me before. It’s so foreign that my arms stay stiff at my sides.

"She’s okay," Nathan says quietly. "Just out of surgery."

I nod, unsure what else to say.

Victoria releases me when she realizes I’m not reciprocating. Her eyes are wet as she reaches for my face, but I step back.

"I’m so glad you’re safe, Sophia. So grateful both my girls are okay," she whispers.

The words sting. I’m not your girl. But before I can say it—

"Darling?" Mom’s gentle voice calls from behind. "It’s time to go home."

Victoria flinches, but I don’t have the energy to care.

My gaze sweeps over them before landing on Ethan. I look away just as fast.

"Tell Isabella thank you… for what she did."

Then I turn and walk to my parents. Dad’s arm wraps around me, Mom’s hand slipping into mine.

I feel eyes burning into my back as we leave. I don’t need to guess whose they are.

My mind churns, but I refuse to look back. I won’t analyze the emotion I’d seen in Ethan’s gaze—the one that looked dangerously like love.

Because that’s impossible.

Ethan only loves one woman.

And her name is Isabella.
###Chapter 86

Two days had passed since Isabella and I were taken. The police had searched for Damian Slade, but he'd vanished again. His captured men refused to talk, leaving us with no leads.

Fear had become my constant companion. I couldn’t bear the thought of being targeted again—especially for something I had no part in.

"Mom, can I play video games?" Liam's voice pulled me from my thoughts.

I'd busied myself with chores to keep my mind occupied. Folding laundry was my current distraction. Once done, I’d have nothing left to do.

"Sure. What time did Hunter say he’s coming?"

Those two were inseparable now. They did everything together, even at school. Their bond reminded me of the one Ethan, Sebastian, and Tristan had shared since childhood.

"Around three."

"Okay. I’ll make snacks for you both."

He kissed my cheek. "You’re the best."

Then he was gone, leaving me alone with my thoughts again. For days, my mind had been a storm of confusion—especially about Ethan.

He’d called a few times, but I’d handed the phone to Liam each time. I wasn’t ready to face him or his sudden change of heart.

His behavior these past months made no sense. How could I matter to him now after nine years of rejection? What had changed?

Nothing. I was still Sophia. The same woman whose love he’d pushed away.

If this shift had happened years ago, I would’ve leaped at the chance. But now? Too much had been said and done. Some wounds never fully heal. Words couldn’t be unsaid. Actions couldn’t be undone.

But isn’t this what you always wanted? a voice whispered. For him to see you, want you?

I couldn’t deny it. Once, I’d dreamed of Ethan craving me. But that fantasy belonged to a naive girl who believed in love’s power. The woman I was now knew better.

Love wasn’t enough. People you loved could shatter you. And some things, once broken, could never be fixed.

Falling for Ethan’s games would be foolish. He’d destroyed me once. I wouldn’t let it happen again.

Protecting my heart and being there for my children was my priority now. That had to be enough.

A knock at the door startled me. Glancing at the clock, I realized it was nearly three. I’d been lost in thought for over an hour.

Sighing, I stood. It was probably Hunter. I’d make their snacks, then take a much-needed nap.

Opening the door, I froze. Hunter stood there—with his father, Lucas.

"Hey," I greeted awkwardly after hugging Hunter.

He didn’t wait for an invitation, darting inside and up the stairs the moment we finished greeting each other.

Lucas and I stood in uncomfortable silence.

I hadn’t seen him since his last visit. Hunter came almost daily, and Liam sometimes went to their house, but Lucas had been avoiding me.

"Do you want to come in?" I asked, watching him shift uncertainly.

"Yeah, if you don’t mind."

I stepped aside. He hesitated before crossing the threshold.

Leading him to the kitchen, I gestured for him to sit while I prepared snacks.

"I heard what happened to you," he said after a pause. "Just wanted to make sure you’re okay."

News traveled fast in this city. Someone had leaked it, and by evening, Isabella and I were all over the news. No one knew I was a Prescott, and I preferred it that way. The scrutiny that name brought wasn’t something I was ready for.

"Uh—thanks," I replied, the awkwardness thickening.

"How’s the face?"

"Better."

The swelling had gone down, leaving only a dark bruise.

Silence settled between us. I wished he’d leave. Awkward situations made me sweat.

"I’m sorry," he said suddenly, his voice cutting through the tension.

"For what?"

"How I’ve treated you. It wasn’t fair. You’ve been nothing but kind to me and my son. I just..."

I stared, stunned. This wasn’t what I’d expected.

"You have to understand—I haven’t had the best experiences with women. Trusting them... it’s hard for me."

Realization dawned. "So it wasn’t because Hunter’s mother died. She hurt you."

The pain flickering across his face said it all. Whoever she was, she’d wrecked him—and still was. He was drowning in it.

"Yeah, but I don’t want to talk about it. It’s too fucking painful," he whispered, struggling to mask the agony.

My heart ached for him. Maybe because he looked so lost. Maybe because I saw myself in him. Either way, I wanted to help.

"I get it, Lucas. More than you know. So I’ll accept your apology—and offer you my friendship."

He eyed me doubtfully before nodding, albeit reluctantly.

I didn’t know much about him, but one thing was clear: he had no support system. He needed someone to pull him from the darkness.

Hadn’t that been me once? Amelia and Daniel had shown me there was more to life than pain.

"Friends?" I extended my hand.

"Friends." He gave a small smile.

As we shook hands, unease prickled in my chest. I didn’t sense danger from him—but something told me Lucas was here for a reason. He had secrets. And when they came out, everything would change.
###Chapter 87

The boredom was crushing me. Absolutely suffocating. Weekends were bearable with Liam around, but weekdays? Pure torture.

Scarlett and Natalie were busy running their businesses all day. My parents were occupied too. I'd hired Elizabeth to manage The Hope Foundation's daily operations. Even if I dropped by, there'd be nothing for me to do except sign a few documents.

Over the past week, we'd grown close with Lucas Montgomery. He owned a thriving construction company, started just two years ago. Naturally, he was also unavailable during the day.

I was so bored that returning to work crossed my mind. At five months pregnant, I still had time before the baby arrived. Instead, I grabbed my phone and dialed.

"Mrs. Delaney, how are you?" I asked.

We lived in the same neighborhood, and she'd called me days ago. Her high school daughter was failing biology, and she'd asked if I could tutor her.

"I'm wonderful, dear! So glad you called. How are you holding up?" Her cheerful voice made me smile.

"Great, thanks." I hesitated. "I was calling about the tutoring. Are you still interested?"

I prayed she hadn't found someone else. Even if she had, other parents had reached out too.

"Oh, absolutely! It's been stressing me out. I admit, I prayed you'd change your mind."

When she first asked, I'd just started my leave. I'd refused, not realizing how mind-numbing staying home would be.

"Perfect. How about after school? She can come to my place."

Afternoons worked for me. Maybe I could even help with the adult toy business discreetly.

"That sounds wonderful. Weekly or per session?"

"Free of charge," I said. "I need something to do during this leave."

Silence. For a moment, I thought she'd hung up.

"Are you... sure?" she finally stammered.

"Positive. Send her over today, and we'll start immediately."

Money wasn't an issue. My liquid assets alone could sustain three generations comfortably.

Teaching was a passion, not a paycheck.

"O-okay. Thank you! She'll come straight after school." Her shock was palpable.

"You're welcome."

After hanging up, I called three more parents who'd requested tutoring. Their reactions mirrored Mrs. Delaney's—stunned disbelief that I wouldn't charge.

By the third call, I realized they knew nothing about me beyond my teaching background. Living in a middle-class neighborhood shielded me from the gossip that plagued the elite. These people were too busy working to care about tabloids.

That anonymity thrilled me. I wanted to be treated normally, not like some wealthy pariah.

After the calls, I sank onto the couch, grinning. For the first time since everything fell apart, I felt purposeful. Light. Hopeful.

A sudden urge to dance hit me. No reason—just pure, bubbling joy.

I showered, letting the hot water ease the last of my tension. Then I rifled through my closet—new clothes, purchased after purging everything Ethan had bought.

A cream bodycon dress caught my eye. Slipping it on, I admired my reflection. Pregnancy had blessed my curves, especially my backside.

I did my makeup—soft nudes—and curled my hair instead of leaving it straight. Ballet flats completed the look.

Just as I grabbed my purse, my phone rang. Unknown number.

"Hello?"

"Sophia. It's Daniel."

His gruff voice sent a jolt through me. I'd have recognized it anywhere. Those months of delirious happiness had etched his tone into my memory—every tender word, every lie.

I shoved the ache aside.

"Daniel. How are you?" My voice stayed steady.

We hadn't seen each other since his arrest. Just letters—mostly pregnancy updates from me.

"Fine." Silence stretched.

Once, we could talk for hours. Now, every second was suffocating.

"Have you spoken to Mom and Dad?" I asked, desperate to break the tension.

It felt strange calling them that to him. They'd raised him. They were his parents too. Now we were having a child. The absurdity wasn't lost on me.

"No."

"Why? They're desperate to see you. Don't they deserve that?"

They hid it well, but I saw their pain. Furious as they were at his betrayal, twenty years of love didn't vanish overnight.

"You know why."

"Your reason is bullshit," I snapped. "You're hurting them. Haven't you done enough? Do you even love them?"

Silence.

"Just talk to them. Please. I've never asked you for anything else. Watching them pretend they're okay kills me."

A sigh. "You know I can't refuse you. I'll see them."

"Thank you." I smiled, relief warming my chest.

"That's not why I called."

"Okay..."

"I heard what happened. Are you and the baby alright?" His voice softened, dragging up memories I'd buried.

God, if only he hadn't lied. We could've had a future.

I didn't ask how he knew. This was Daniel. He had eyes everywhere.

"We're fine. I have an appointment today—was just leaving."

"Is it weird that I already want to hold her?" For the first time since everything collapsed, he sounded... happy.

"Her? You think it's a girl?"

"Yeah. I'm sure of it." Sheepish now. I could picture him rubbing his neck.

I laughed. "Guess Liam isn't the only one rooting for a girl."

"Guess not. Do you want another boy?"

I considered it. "Gender doesn't matter. I already love this baby."

And it was true. When I'd first found out, I'd been a wreck. But I'd fallen in love. Ethan's sins didn't change that. Rowan had hurt me worse, and I still adored Liam.

"I should go. Don't want to be late. I'll write after the appointment."

"Sophia—about Damien Slade. Don't worry. He won't touch you. You're safe from his revenge. Take care."

He hung up before I could respond.

As I headed out, his words haunted me. Safe from his revenge? What had Daniel done? Threatened him? Killed him?

The questions followed me all the way to the clinic.
###Chapter 88

My fingers drum against the clinic bench as I wait for Sophia. The sterile scent of antiseptic fills the air, but all I can focus on is the ticking clock. She’s going to be furious—I know it. But this gnawing need to be here, to stand by her, won’t let me stay away.

She’d deliberately kept her next appointment date from me. Typical Sophia. So, I did what I do best: took matters into my own hands. Some might call it overbearing. I call it necessary.

The memory of my first time being this nervous slams into me. Thirteen years old, fumbling in the backseat of my dad’s car, clueless and embarrassingly quick. The girl had glared at me like I’d committed a crime.

The clinic door swings open, snapping me back to the present.

"Ethan?" Sophia’s voice is sharp, laced with disbelief. "What the hell are you doing here?"

I turn, and my breath stutters.

Sunlight spills through the windows, catching the gold flecks in her brown eyes. She’s wearing a simple blue dress that hugs her curves, her dark hair loose around her shoulders. No makeup, just faint shadows under her eyes from sleepless nights. And yet—she’s breathtaking.

Isabella would’ve spent an hour contouring her face before stepping out. Sophia? She just exists, and it’s enough to unravel me.

"I told you I wouldn’t miss this," I say, standing.

Her jaw tightens. Storm clouds gather in her gaze. She’s seconds from unleashing hell—

So I cut her off.

My hand cups her cheek, pulling her close before she can protest. My lips brush her forehead, lingering longer than necessary. Her skin is warm, soft. She freezes, her breath hitching.

For a heartbeat, it’s just us. No past. No pain. Just this.

Then she shoves me back, eyes blazing. "What the hell was that?"

I smirk. "Felt like it."

Before she can retaliate, a nurse calls her name. Sophia shoots me a glare that could melt steel and storms off. I follow, my gaze locked on the sway of her hips.

Inside the exam room, Dr. Bennett greets us warmly. "Sophia! And Mr. Blackwood—good to see you both."

Sophia forces a smile. I nod, my attention snagging on the ultrasound machine. This doctor delivered Liam. Now she’ll bring our second child into the world. The thought twists something in my chest.

Sophia changes into a gown, then lies back on the table. Dr. Bennett explains the transvaginal scan first, and my stomach knots. "Is there a problem?"

"Routine check," the doctor assures. "Just ensuring everything’s healthy."

I watch as Sophia tenses, her fingers gripping the edges of the table. My gut churns. I should’ve been there for Liam’s appointments. Should’ve known.

When the scan finishes, Dr. Bennett smiles. "Everything looks perfect. Much smoother than your first pregnancy."

My head snaps up. "What happened the first time?"

Sophia sits up abruptly. "It doesn’t matter."

"Like hell it doesn’t."

Dr. Bennett hesitates, but Sophia cuts in, her voice brittle. "Drop it, Ethan."

I don’t.

Her composure cracks.

"You want to know?" she snaps, eyes glistening. "I was eighteen. Alone. Scared. My blood pressure spiked constantly. Your family hated me. You hated me. Dr. Bennett warned me my baby might not survive because I was so stressed." Her voice breaks. "But hey, Liam’s fine now, right? So who cares?"

The words gut me.

She grabs her things and bolts. I chase her to the parking lot, my chest burning.

"Sophia—"

"Save it," she spits, yanking her car door open. "You don’t get to play the concerned husband now."

The engine roars to life. Tires screech as she peels away.

I stand there, fists clenched, the weight of my failures crushing me.

My phone rings. It’s Vanessa, my new secretary. "The Shanghai investors arrived early. They’re demanding a meeting."

"Tell them to wait or get out." I hang up, still staring at the empty road.

Sophia’s right.

I don’t get to pretend now.

But damn if I won’t try.
###Chapter 89

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Sophia stirred awake.

Her phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand.

She reached for it, blinking against the brightness of the screen.

A message from Daniel.

Her breath hitched.

"We need to talk."

Three words that never meant anything good.

Sophia sat up, her fingers trembling as she typed a reply.

"About what?"

She waited, heart pounding.

The dots appeared, then disappeared.

Then—

"Not over text. Meet me at the café near the precinct. Noon."

Sophia exhaled sharply.

This couldn’t be good.

She glanced at the clock—10:37 AM.

Enough time to overthink.

She threw back the covers and headed for the shower.

The hot water did little to ease the tension coiling in her stomach.

What could Daniel possibly want to discuss?

Their last conversation had been strained, but nothing catastrophic.

Unless…

Her stomach dropped.

Had he found out about Ethan’s latest threats?

Or worse—had Ethan made good on them?

She shut off the water and wrapped herself in a towel.

Her reflection in the mirror looked pale, shadows under her eyes.

She needed to pull herself together.

By the time she dressed—black jeans, a cream sweater, boots—her nerves were frayed.

She grabbed her keys and headed out.

The café was only a fifteen-minute drive, but it felt like an eternity.

Daniel was already there when she arrived, seated at a corner table.

His expression was unreadable.

Sophia slid into the chair across from him.

"You look like hell," he said bluntly.

She snorted. "Thanks."

A waitress appeared, and Sophia ordered a latte.

Daniel didn’t touch his coffee.

Silence stretched between them.

Finally, Sophia couldn’t take it anymore.

"What’s going on, Daniel?"

He leaned forward, his voice low.

"I got a call last night. From an old contact."

Sophia frowned. "And?"

Daniel’s jaw tightened.

"Ethan’s not just making threats, Sophia. He’s moving."

Her blood ran cold.

"What does that mean?"

Daniel’s gaze locked onto hers.

"It means he’s coming for you. And this time, he won’t stop until he gets what he wants."

Sophia’s latte arrived, but she couldn’t bring herself to drink it.

Her hands were shaking too badly.

Daniel reached across the table, covering her fingers with his.

"I won’t let him hurt you," he said quietly.

Sophia swallowed hard.

But the question lingered between them—

How?

Because Ethan Blackwood didn’t play by the rules.

And neither did the storm that was coming.

Ethan Blackwood had clearly been working all day. So had my parents. I'd hired Elizabeth to keep me updated about Sophia's next doctor's appointment, but when she hesitated, I took matters into my own hands. I know that makes me an insufferable bastard—always pushing boundaries—but I’ve never been one to back down. Right now, all I want is to be there for her.

If it were up to me, I would’ve picked her up myself. Instead, I chose to wait at the clinic, already defying her wishes.

I haven’t felt this nervous in years. The last time my stomach twisted like this was when I lost my virginity at thirteen—clueless, fumbling, and embarrassingly quick. The memory makes me grimace.

Shaking off the thought, I focus on the clinic door. I arrived early, knowing I’d have to wait.

"Ethan? What are you doing here?" Her voice snaps me out of my thoughts.

I hadn’t even noticed her approach. How long had I been sitting here, lost in my head?

Turning to face her, my breath catches. She was breathtaking. Effortlessly stunning. How had I never seen it before? How had I ever believed she couldn’t compare to Isabella?

Some might call it the pregnancy glow, but I disagree. Isabella spent hours perfecting her appearance before stepping outside. Sophia, though? She didn’t need makeup. I’d seen her exhausted, dark circles under her eyes, and she still looked perfect to me.

Clearing my throat, I answer, "I told you I’d be at every appointment."

A shadow crosses her face. She’s furious—rightfully so. I brace myself for the explosion, but strangely, it doesn’t faze me.

My gaze drifts over her figure. The dress she’s wearing hugs her curves in all the right places.

When my eyes meet hers again, I know she’s about to tell me to leave. Before she can, I stand, cup her face, pull her close, and press a kiss to her forehead.

She freezes, stunned.

My lips linger. I know I should let go, but this feels right. Like she was always meant to be in my arms—if only I hadn’t been so damn stubborn.

Reluctantly, I release her. Her eyes are wide, lips parted in shock.

"What the hell, Ethan?" she snaps when she recovers. "Why would you do that?"

"Because I wanted to," I say with a shrug.

Before she can respond, her name is called. She glares at me before storming off. I follow, smirking, my gaze fixed on the sway of her hips.

Inside the exam room, everything is set up.

"Good to see you, Sophia," Dr. Bennett says warmly before nodding at me. "Mr. Blackwood."

"You too, Dr. Bennett," Sophia replies while I simply nod.

I was surprised to learn Dr. Bennett had delivered Liam and was now overseeing this pregnancy too.

"You know the drill, dear. Change into this, and we’ll check on your little one," the doctor says.

Sophia takes the gown and disappears into the changing room. Minutes later, she returns and lies on the exam table.

"Today, we’ll do a transvaginal scan first," Dr. Bennett explains.

"Is something wrong?" Sophia asks, concern flickering in her eyes.

"Not at all. It’s routine—just to ensure your cervix is healthy." The doctor smiles reassuringly. "I’ll insert this now. Let me know if it’s uncomfortable, okay?"

Meanwhile, back at home, I was bored out of my mind.

With Natalie handling the day-to-day operations of The Hope Foundation, there was little for me to do besides sign documents.

Lucas Montgomery, our new neighbor, had become a good friend over the past week. He owned a construction company and was just as busy as I was during the day.

I was so restless that I considered returning to work—even at five months pregnant. Instead, I picked up my phone and dialed.

"Mrs. Delaney? How are you?" I ask.

We lived in the same neighborhood, and she’d called days ago, asking if I could tutor her struggling high schooler in biology.

"I’m wonderful, dear! So glad you called. How are you?" Her cheerful voice makes me smile.

"I’m well, thank you," I say, pausing. "I was calling about tutoring your daughter. Are you still interested?"

I hoped she hadn’t found someone else—though others had reached out too.

"Oh, absolutely! I’ve been praying you’d reconsider!"

When she first asked, I’d just started my leave and declined. Now, I was desperate for something to do.

"Perfect. How about after school? She can come to my place," I suggest.

Afternoons worked for me. Maybe I could even help with the sex toy business—discreetly, of course.

"Wonderful! Will you charge per session or weekly?"

"It’s free," I say. "I’m just looking for ways to fill my time."

Silence. Then, hesitantly: "Are you sure?"

"Positive. Have her come by today, and we’ll start immediately."

Money wasn’t an issue. My assets could sustain generations. Teaching was a passion, not a paycheck.

After hanging up, I called three more parents who’d asked for tutoring. Each reacted the same—shocked I wouldn’t accept payment.

By the third call, I realized they knew nothing about me beyond being a teacher. Living in a middle-class neighborhood meant no gossip columns. And I loved that.

No special treatment. Just normalcy.

Satisfied, I leaned back, smiling. For the first time in months, I felt like things were falling into place.

Giddy, I headed to the shower, letting the hot water relax me further.

Afterward, I rifled through my closet—now filled with clothes I’d bought after donating everything Ethan had given me.

I chose a cream bodycon dress, admiring my reflection. Pregnancy had done wonders for my curves.

Today, I did my makeup—soft and natural—and curled my hair. Slipping into ballet flats, I was ready.

Then my phone rang.

An unknown number.

I answered.
###Chapter 90

I stood frozen at the door, my knuckles hovering inches from the wood. What the hell was I doing here? Sophia needed space—that much was obvious. But damn it, I couldn’t stay away. There was something about her that pulled me in, an invisible force I couldn’t fight even if I wanted to.

I knocked, my impatience growing with every second that passed. When the door finally swung open, Liam’s bright eyes greeted me.

"Dad!" He launched himself into my arms, and I caught him effortlessly, his small frame fitting perfectly against mine. "I thought I had to wait until Saturday to see you!"

I held him tighter, the tension in my shoulders easing. "Hey, buddy."

How had I ever resented Sophia? The thought clawed at me. She’d given me the greatest gift—Liam. I should’ve cherished her instead of punishing her. That night, the one I’d spent years regretting, had brought me the one thing I’d never trade.

I’d been too blind to see it then. Too wrapped up in my own bitterness. But now? Now it was crystal clear. Sophia had been right. I’d spent so long hating that night, not realizing that without it, there would be no Liam. And I would never regret my son.

"Come in," Liam said, pulling back. "Mom’s in the shower. She said she needed to soak her tired bones."

He led me to the kitchen, hopping onto a stool and pointing to the food. Without hesitation, I grabbed a plate and piled it high.

I’d taken so much for granted when we were married. Now, the simple taste of her cooking hit me like a punch to the gut. I’d missed this. Missed her.

"So… Mom’s kind of a catch, huh?" Liam said between bites, his tone far too innocent.

I raised a brow. "Yeah."

"A lot of guys think so," he continued, feigning nonchalance. "Just the other day, some guy came by to see her. Wonder who’ll end up marrying her."

The smirk he tried to hide didn’t escape me.

"What guy?"

I fought to keep my voice steady, but jealousy burned through me like wildfire. The urge to roar that Sophia was mine nearly choked me.

"Don’t remember his name," Liam mused. "Mom said he was a new friend. Scary-looking, but cool. Tattoos everywhere. Women love that, right? Plus, he had abs."

I glared. He chuckled.

Little shit. He was baiting me, and it was working.

"Liam, who was at the door?" Sophia’s voice cut through the tension before I could respond.

She stepped into the kitchen, wrapped in nothing but a robe, her damp hair curling at the ends. No makeup, just her—flawless. The robe clung to her curves, and every instinct in me screamed to rip it off.

"Ethan?" Her expression shuttered, walls slamming into place. "What are you doing here?"

I hated that. Hated how she hid behind indifference now. Once, I could read her like an open book. Now? She was a locked vault.

"Ethan?" she repeated when I didn’t answer.

What could I say? That I missed her? That I just needed to see her?

"I’m out," Liam announced, sliding off the stool. "Don’t forget to say goodbye, Dad."

He bolted before either of us could stop him, leaving us alone in the thick silence.

"Who’s the guy Liam mentioned?" I demanded, closing the distance between us.

She stepped back, but the counter trapped her. "What guy?"

"The one in your long line of suitors," I bit out, jealousy turning my voice rough.

Her eyes flashed. "I have no idea what you’re talking about. And it’s late. You should go."

"Why? So you can entertain one of your admirers?"

I was pushing. I knew it. But I didn’t care. Not when the thought of another man touching her made me see red.

"What is wrong with you?" she hissed.

I moved closer, my hands finding her waist, pulling her against me. Her body molded to mine, soft and warm. The hardened peaks of her breasts pressed into my chest, and I groaned.

This wasn’t just want. It was something deeper. Something terrifying.

"Get your hands off me," she snapped, shoving at my chest.

I didn’t budge. Couldn’t. She felt too damn good.

"Not happening, Sophia. You’re mine."

"The hell I am!" She twisted, but I held firm. "Let me go before Liam sees us and gets the wrong idea!"

"Liam would be thrilled," I growled. "And you are mine. I’m not letting you whore yourself out to other men when you belong to me."

Her hand moved faster than I expected. The slap stung, shocking me enough that I released her.

"Whoring myself?" she seethed. "First of all, I was a virgin when we first slept together. Second, I can sleep with whoever I want. I’m free, Ethan. Free to be with men who actually want me—not men who fantasize about another woman while they’re inside me!"

The words were a knife to the gut. I’d brought this on myself.

"Sophia—"

"No!" Her voice cracked. "What do you want from me? You made it abundantly clear that I was just a stand-in for Isabella. That I’d never be the woman you loved. So why are you here? Why won’t you leave me alone?"

I opened my mouth, but the words lodged in my throat. How could I explain something I barely understood myself?

"I want you," I admitted, my voice raw. "So damn much."

Her laugh was hollow. "Why now? After nine years of marriage? How can you suddenly want me when you spent nearly a decade ignoring me?"

She had a point. But how could I explain the storm inside me?

"Is it so hard to believe I want you?"

"Yes," she spat. "You hated me. So yes, it’s impossible to believe you suddenly want me."

The truth hovered on my tongue. The emotion I’d been too blind to name.

"Please leave," she whispered. "You’re confused. Even if you think you want me, it doesn’t mean anything."

"It does," I insisted, desperation clawing at me. "It means we have something to fight for."

"No, it doesn’t." Her voice broke. "Not when I can still hear you telling me I was just a replacement for Isabella."

I wanted to argue, but the exhaustion in her eyes stopped me. She was done.

"Fine," I relented. "Call Liam so I can say goodbye."

She nodded stiffly and left. When Liam returned, I ignored his questioning look, ruffled his hair, and left.

This wasn’t over. Not even close.

As I drove away, the realization hit me like a truck. I had to pull over, my hands shaking on the wheel.

Because suddenly, I knew.

I loved her.

Fuck. I loved Sophia.

And I’d destroyed any chance she’d ever believe me.

Karma was a vicious bitch.

###Chapter 91

A groan escapes my lips as I spill myself onto her back. This was exactly what I needed—the perfect way to unwind after a long day.

She turns her head, eyes gleaming with satisfaction. "So, when’s the next time? Tomorrow?"

I can see the relaxation in her posture. Maybe she needed this just as much as I did. I grab a towel and wipe my release off her skin, but I don’t answer. She knows how this works. I call the shots, not her.

By the time she’s dressed, it’s past ten. I need sleep before my packed schedule tomorrow.

Like always, she doesn’t linger. No sleepovers. No cuddling. Just sex. Nothing more.

"Sebastian?"

She’s the only one who dares to use my full name. I hate it. It reminds me of some damn saint when I’m anything but.

"Enough. You don’t get to decide when this happens again," I snap, irritation flaring at her question.

Hurt flickers across her face, but I ignore it. She knew the rules when she signed up for this.

"So, I just wait until you’re bored with your other women?" she murmurs.

I’ve never hidden the fact that she isn’t the only one. I like variety. Tonight, I wanted her. Tomorrow? Who knows.

"Yes," I say coldly.

The light in her eyes dims. She fights to keep her emotions in check, but I see it—the pain I’ve caused.

Damn it.

I hate when they catch feelings. Two years of this arrangement, and now she’s ruining it.

She didn’t have time for relationships, and I don’t do relationships. This was supposed to be simple. Besides, she’s just my secretary. Even if I did date, she wouldn’t fit into my world.

"I thought you could handle this," I say, voice sharp. "Clearly, I was wrong. This is the last time. You’ll keep working for me like nothing ever happened. Understood, Vanessa?"

Her gaze locks onto mine, sharp and unyielding.

"I can’t do this anymore," she whispers, tears welling. "I love you, but you’ll never love me back. You’ve shut yourself off, and I can’t keep pretending this is enough."

She’s a damn good secretary, but I won’t let emotions ruin this.

"Guess it’s time for your resignation letter, then," I smirk, mocking her.

She doesn’t respond. Just shakes her head and walks out. I don’t stop her. Instead, I unlock the gates remotely and let her go.

Once she’s gone, I collapse onto my bed.

She’s right. I have closed off my heart. Love? No thanks. My parents have a fairytale marriage, but that’s one in a million.

I’ve seen what love does. How it destroys.

It nearly killed Ethan when he lost Isabella. He was a walking corpse for months until Liam was born. Drowning himself in alcohol, barely functioning.

Why would I ever give a woman that kind of power over me?

Ethan was wrecked when things fell apart with Isabella. And now? Now I’m terrified of the same thing happening to him.

He doesn’t realize it yet, but he loves Sophia. When it finally hits him, it’s going to destroy him—knowing he’s hurt her over and over again.

I exhale sharply and head to the shower. Ten minutes under scalding water, and I’m still restless. Something’s wrong. And I have a sinking feeling it’s Ethan.

I dry off and pull on sweats, reaching for my phone—just as my security system disengages. Only one other person has access.

Ethan.

I make it downstairs just as he stumbles through the door, reeking of whiskey.

"Ethan? What the hell?" I grab him before he faceplants.

He’s drunk. Really drunk. That alone sets off alarms. He hasn’t been like this since his darkest days.

I haul him to the couch and drop beside him. "What happened?"

His voice is raw. "You were right. Again. I fucked up. How the hell do I fix what I broke?"

The pain in his words guts me. He’s my twin. His suffering is mine.

"Explain," I demand.

He looks wrecked. Like his world just imploded.

"I love her, Seb. Fuck, I love her," he chokes out.

"Who?"

"Sophia!" he shouts. "It hit me today."

And it hit him hard. This is exactly what I feared. The realization is destroying him.

"Why didn’t I see it sooner?" His voice cracks. "She’ll never believe me now. I spent years making her pay for that night. I hurt her so damn much."

A tear streaks down his face. His gray eyes—mirrors of my own—are filled with agony.

"How do I fix this? How do I mend a heart I shattered?"

I pull him into a rough embrace. Ethan never shows weakness. Not even when Isabella left.

His shoulders shake as he fights to hold himself together.

Nine years of pain won’t be undone easily. Sophia isn’t the same woman she was. She’s stronger now. She won’t let him close.

"I don’t know," I admit. "But you’re Ethan fucking Blackwood. You don’t quit. You’ll fix this."

He straightens, staring blankly ahead. "What if she doesn’t take me back?"

This isn’t my brother. The doubt in his voice proves how much power Sophia has over him. More than Isabella ever did.

What he felt for Isabella was young love. Easy. Fragile.

What he feels for Sophia? It’s deeper. Stronger.

"You’ll fight," I say quietly.

We sit in silence until he passes out. I carry him to the guest room and watch him for a moment, even in sleep, he’s tormented.

I want to believe he’ll win her back. But nine years is a long time to hurt someone.

If Sophia gives him another chance, it’ll be a miracle.

All I can do is hope. Hope that her love for him isn’t completely gone.

Because I’m not sure he’ll survive losing her.
###Chapter 92

My eyelids fly open. Sunlight assaults my vision, making me wince. A dull throbbing pulses through my skull—like some asshole decided to use my head for drum practice all night.

It takes a full minute to recognize my surroundings—Sebastian's guest room. We've always done this. He keeps a room at my penthouse, and I have one in his brownstone.

Groaning, I drag myself to the bathroom. The shower's spray hits my back as I brace against the tiled wall, trying to piece together last night's fragments. Nothing but hazy memories of whiskey and regret.

Christ. How did I end up here? How the hell did I fall for Sophia without even realizing it?

The moment the truth hit me, I'd bolted to the underground club beneath my office building. I don't get drunk—made that promise after Liam was born. But last night? Last night demanded obliteration.

There's no cure for this. No fucking antidote. How do you process loving the woman you've spent nine years destroying?

I emerge from the steam feeling decades older. Dressed in yesterday's wrinkled shirt, I descend to find Sebastian nursing coffee at the marble breakfast bar.

"Where's Margaret?" I rasp, reaching for the carafe.

"Left for the farmers' market at dawn." Sebastian's lips twitch. "You know how she feels about supermarket produce."

His housekeeper treated grocery stores like biological warfare—insisted on sourcing everything from local vendors.

"You look like hell."

"Feel like I got trampled by a polo team."

When the realization struck, I'd nearly driven to Sophia's apartment at 3 AM. Only sheer willpower stopped me. Too soon. She'd never believe me now.

I've faced boardroom coups and death threats without flinching. But this? This terrifies me. Is this how she felt all those years? Loving someone who despised her?

"Thought you swore off drinking after Liam," Sebastian remarks, pushing a plate of toast toward me.

"Needed the numbness." My knuckles whiten around the mug. "You can't imagine realizing you've spent years torturing the woman you love."

I pretend not to see her flinch when I pick up Liam. Ignore the hatred in her eyes when our hands accidentally brush. I'll take any scrap of attention—even disgust—just to be near her.

What she dishes out is nothing compared to my sins. Yet every glare still feels like a knife twist. How did she endure nine years of this?

She wants me gone. Deserves that peace. But I can't fucking let go.

"How?" Sebastian's brow furrows. "Last week you were certain about Isabella."

"You're the one who insisted I had feelings for Sophia."

He'd badgered me for months, even when I swore I felt nothing. Bastard always sees what I refuse to acknowledge.

"I believed it," he admits. "But your denials made me doubt myself."

I scrub a hand down my face. "You were right. I just wish to Christ I'd realized before destroying everything."



The memories choke me—countless ways I broke her. Chipped away at her soul until nothing remained.

"Wouldn't trade places with you," Sebastian whistles. "But answer this—when did it happen?"

"Fuck if I know." My chair screeches as I stand. "Maybe during the marriage. Maybe recently. All I know is I'm drowning in it now."

My fingers knot in my hair. Fear and frustration coil in my gut. Worst possible fucking timing.

"It was always there," Sebastian muses. "Probably after Liam. You clung to Isabella's memory like a lifeline—first love doesn't mean true love. Nine years together? You felt something, Ethan. You wouldn't have touched her otherwise."

"Biology," I mutter, bile rising. "Sometimes I pretended she was Isabella."

The admission tastes like poison.

"Really?" Sebastian's gaze sharpens. "Or were you using Isabella as an excuse? Something to keep you from enjoying intimacy with Sophia? Because liking it would've felt like betraying your precious memories?"

The stool clatters as I sit, stunned.

Hadn't considered that. The attraction was undeniable—why else would my body respond so easily? Maybe Sebastian's right. Maybe Isabella was just a shield.

In my twisted logic, I'd already betrayed my "true love" once. Couldn't risk doing it repeatedly by wanting Sophia. Made sense then. Now I see the truth—Isabella was never my fucking destiny.

"Christ." My palms slam the countertop. "I'm so goddamn screwed."

"Do you love Isabella?"

The headshake comes instantly.

"Sure? No lingering feelings?"

I exhale slowly.

"Yes. When she reappeared, I thought it was fate. But something felt...wrong. Wouldn't even let her kiss me." My jaw clenches. "Should've been my first clue. That and wanting to murder Daniel whenever he touched Sophia."

The mere thought of them together still ignites something primal in my chest.

"Took losing her to wake you up," Sebastian observes. "Seeing her happy with another man forced suppressed feelings to surface. You clung to Isabella because your story felt unfinished."

His words ring true, but they're no comfort. The damage is done. Words can't be unspoken. Wounds don't vanish.

"What now?" he asks quietly.

I stare at my distorted reflection in the polished ebony table. "She's stunning, Sebastian. Brilliant. Fiercely loving. Any man would be lucky to have her."

My gut twists remembering how Daniel's eyes softened around her. That bastard actually changed for her. A woman who inspires that kind of transformation? She's goddamn miraculous. And I threw her away.

Sebastian grips my shoulder. "You'll figure it out."

I wish I shared his confidence. Because the crushing truth is this—after everything, I don't deserve her. And my greatest terror? Watching her find someone who does.
###Chapter 93

The phone vibrates in my hand as Victoria's cheerful voice comes through. "How are you holding up, sweetheart? And how are Liam and the baby?"

Once again, my parents were overseas for business. It didn’t surprise me—they had their own private jet, just like Ethan. He owned one, and there was also a family jet. I’d never stepped foot inside his. We barely traveled together.

When my fortune skyrocketed, I briefly considered buying my own jet. But the thought vanished as quickly as it came. What would I even use it for? I rarely traveled far enough to justify the expense. If I needed to go somewhere, I either chartered one or flew business class.

"Sophia?"

"Sorry, Mom. We're all good. Just missing you both like crazy."

And it was true. They’d been gone for a week and wouldn’t return for another. Liam and I missed them more than I expected. It was strange how quickly they’d become such an integral part of our lives.

"We miss you too. Your father says hi, by the way. He’ll call you tonight when he’s less swamped."

"That’s fine."

"Have you bought anything new for the baby yet? Four months isn’t long—soon, he or she will be here." Her voice sparkled with excitement, as always, when she talked about the baby.

"How am I supposed to buy anything when everyone else already has? This baby will have more than enough options." I laughed.

The nursery was overflowing. I thought my parents, Scarlett, and Natalie were excessive—until Damien entered the picture.

Since I allowed him into the baby’s life, he’d been sending adorable gifts. I had no idea where or when he shopped, given he was in hiding. Every single item he’d sent was pink. Like Liam and Daniel, he was convinced it would be a girl.

My smile faded at the thought of him. I’d made a promise, but I couldn’t shake the guilt. I might not have had the best relationship with my father, but he still raised me.



"I can’t wait for the baby to arrive. I missed Liam’s birth, so I’m making up for it with this one," Mom said, pulling me from my dark thoughts.

"Can I call you back? Scarlett and Natalie are here for lunch."

It might not have been them yet, but my mood had already plummeted.

"Of course. Talk later. Love you, Sophia."

"Love you too, Mom." I hung up and sighed, setting the phone down.

The second it left my hand, my conflicting thoughts attacked.

Father wasn’t the only problem tied to Damien. There was also Ethan. He wasn’t my favorite person, but he was Liam’s father. Damien was hell-bent on revenge, and losing Ethan would destroy Liam.

There was also the risk he’d target those Ethan loved—people Liam adored too (except for Isabella, of course). I didn’t know what to do. Part of me regretted giving Damien a chance, while the other half insisted I trust my instincts—and my instincts said it was the right choice.

"What’s got you so deep in thought?" Natalie’s voice startled me.

"Jesus, you scared me!" I pressed a hand to my chest, as if that would slow my racing heart.

"Sorry. I thought you saw me coming," she said sheepishly.

I’d been so lost in my head that I hadn’t noticed them slipping into the private booth.

"It’s fine… just a lot on my mind."

"Care to share?" Scarlett asked, sliding into her seat.

I shook my head. "Not really."

It wasn’t that I didn’t want to—I just didn’t know how. How do you tell your best friends that the most wanted criminal is your baby’s uncle? That we’ve been in contact, and worse, I’ve allowed him into my child’s life?



"Is this about Ethan again?" Scarlett leaned forward, eyes oddly bright. "Nathan mentioned he called a few days ago, completely wasted."

I frowned. I couldn’t remember the last time Ethan got drunk. He’d cut back after Liam was born. Plus, he’d gone radio silent since showing up unannounced at my house that night.

I still couldn’t believe I’d punched him. It felt incredible—something I’d wanted to do for years.

"Why was he drunk?" Natalie asked, curiosity dripping from her words.

Scarlett shrugged. "Nathan and I have no idea, but I bet Sebastian knows. And I double bet Sophia has a clue."

They both turned to me, expectant. I shifted uncomfortably.

"Spill," Scarlett demanded.

"Honestly, I don’t know. The last time I saw him, he showed up at my house uninvited. His behavior was… off. So I told him to leave."

"Define ‘off,’" Natalie pressed.

"He got jealous when Liam mentioned—" I caught myself before saying Damien’s name. "Liam mentioned something about suitors, and Ethan lost it. Said I belonged to him and he wouldn’t let me ‘whore myself’ to other men."

Even now, the memory made my blood boil. Belonged to him? Since when? I wasn’t some object—I was a person.

"Ooh, possessive. Never thought I’d see the day Ethan Blackwood got territorial over you," Scarlett sighed dreamily.

I stared at her like she’d lost her mind.

"You can’t be serious. This is Ethan we’re talking about. The same man who spent nine years telling me I meant nothing to him. That he’d never love me because he hated my guts."

The pain had faded, replaced by anger. All that heartbreak—for what? He was still a thorn in my side.

"I think he’s finally realized he wants you. Why else would he—"

"Even if that’s true—which I doubt—it doesn’t matter. It’s too late. I gave him countless chances during our marriage, and he wasted every one. All he gave me was pain. I don’t see this the way you do."

They fell silent, staring at me like they wanted to argue but didn’t know how. Right now, I just wanted to drop the Ethan issue. I had enough on my plate without adding him to the mix.

"Look, I know you want me happy, and for some reason, you think that’s with Ethan. But you’re wrong. Our relationship was doomed from the start. We’re toxic. I loved and hated him simultaneously—he only hated me. I tried changing myself to make him love me, and it didn’t work. Even if I tried now, it wouldn’t. The love I had is buried under pain, resentment, and bitterness. So please, drop it."

You can’t force the heart to want what it doesn’t. That’s what Scarlett and Natalie were trying to do—manufacture feelings that didn’t exist. They wanted my fairytale ending to be with Ethan. Why couldn’t they understand that wishing for it didn’t make it real?

Sure, Ethan was acting different. But I believed it was temporary. Men wanted what they couldn’t have. He wanted me now because I was out of reach. Once the chase lost its thrill, he’d return to his true love. If I gave in, I’d be left heartbroken—again—when he realized I wasn’t what he wanted.

"Let’s focus on why we’re here," I said after the silence stretched too long.

"Fine," Scarlett grumbled.

"Alright," Natalie agreed.

I exhaled in relief, grateful they’d let it go—for now. I knew Scarlett would bring it up again, but I’d handle it then.

"Can we go somewhere else? This pretentious place is grating on my nerves with all these snooty waitstaff," Scarlett announced suddenly.

"We could go to my restaurant," Natalie suggested.

I didn’t point out they should’ve thought of that earlier. Instead, I stayed quiet.

"Nah. Have you ever been to a fast-food joint or an ice cream shop?" Scarlett turned to Natalie, whose eyes darted nervously.

She shook her head. "Not really."

"Perfect. Today’s your lucky day. We’re having lunch at a burger place, then frozen yogurt, then your office to discuss business."

I smirked at Natalie’s deer-in-headlights expression. It was time she experienced the real world—far better than the stuck-up circles we usually moved in.

Scarlett yanked Natalie up while I stood.

"What if I get food poisoning? I’ve heard those places aren’t hygienic," Natalie protested, trying to wiggle free.

"So what? You’ll spend a few days glued to the toilet, then bounce back. Trust me—greasy food beats this fancy crap any day," Scarlett declared.

Laughing, I followed them, enjoying their bickering. It was refreshing.

I was just thinking how grateful I was for friends like them when a venomous voice shattered my joy.

"Well, well. Look who it is—the pregnant slut."

I turned to see Olivia glaring at me, hatred burning in her eyes. And as if that wasn’t bad enough, Isabella stood beside her.

I closed my eyes and exhaled. Why does the universe hate me so much?
###Chapter 94

"Sophia, how are you?" Mom's voice filters through the phone, warm and familiar. "And how are the baby and Liam?"

Once again, they were overseas for business. It didn’t surprise me that they had their own private jet—Ethan did too. He owned one, and there was also a family jet. I’d never stepped foot inside his. Probably because we never traveled together.

When my wealth skyrocketed, I briefly considered buying my own jet. But I dismissed the idea immediately. What would I even use it for? I rarely went anywhere that required such luxury. If I needed to travel, I either chartered one or flew business class.

"Sophia?"

"Sorry, Mom. We’re all good. Just missing you like crazy."

And it was true. They’d been gone for a week and wouldn’t return for another. Liam and I missed them more than we expected. It was surprising how quickly they’d become such an integral part of our lives.

"We miss you too. Your dad says hi, by the way. He’ll call you tonight when he’s less swamped."

"That’s fine."

"So, have you bought anything new for the baby? Four months isn’t long. Soon, he or she will be here." As always, excitement laced her voice when she talked about the baby.

"How am I supposed to buy anything when everyone around me already has? This baby will have more than enough options." I laughed.

The nursery was overflowing. I thought Mom, Dad, Amelia, and Natalie were excessive—until Damian entered the picture.

Ever since I allowed him to be part of the baby’s life, he’d been sending adorable little gifts. I didn’t even know where or when he shopped, given he was in hiding. Everything he bought was pink. Like Liam and Daniel, he was convinced it would be a girl.

My smile faded as thoughts of him resurfaced. I’d made him a promise, but I hadn’t gotten along with my father, despite him raising me.



"I can’t wait for the baby to be born. I missed Liam’s birth, so I’m making up for it with this one." Her voice pulled me from my dark thoughts.

"Mom, can I call you back? Amelia and Natalie are here for lunch, and I see them pulling up."

It probably wasn’t them, but my mood had already plummeted.

"Of course. Talk later. Love you, Sophia."

"Love you too, Mom." I hung up and sighed, setting my phone down.

The moment I did, my conflicted thoughts attacked.

Father wasn’t the only issue with Damian. There was also Ethan. He wasn’t my favorite person, but he was Liam’s father. Damian was hell-bent on revenge, and losing Ethan would destroy Liam.

There was also the possibility he’d target those Ethan loved—people Liam loved too, except for Isabella. I didn’t know what to do. Part of me regretted giving Damian a chance, while the other urged me to trust my instincts, which told me it was the right decision.

"What’s got you so deep in thought?" Natalie’s voice startled me.

"Jesus, you scared me." I pressed a hand to my chest, as if that would slow my racing heart.

"Sorry. I thought you saw me." She looked sheepish.

I’d been so lost in my head that I hadn’t noticed them entering the private booth.

"It’s fine. Just… a lot on my mind."

"Care to share?" Amelia asked, taking her seat.

I shook my head. "Not really."

It wasn’t that I didn’t want to—I just didn’t know how. How do you tell your friends that the criminal the entire city is hunting is your baby’s uncle? That we’ve been in contact, and worse, I’ve allowed him into my child’s life?

"Is this about Ethan again?" Amelia leaned forward, eyes oddly bright. "Nathan mentioned he called a few days ago, completely wasted."

I frowned. I couldn’t remember the last time Ethan got drunk. He’d cut back after Liam was born. Plus, he’d gone radio silent since showing up unannounced at my house that night.

I still couldn’t believe I’d punched him. It felt good—I’d wanted to do that for years.

"Why was he drunk?" Natalie asked, curious.

Amelia shrugged. "Nathan and I have no idea, but I bet Sebastian knows. And I double bet Sophia does too."

They both turned to me expectantly. I shifted uncomfortably.

"Spill," Amelia demanded.

"Honestly, I don’t know. The last time I saw him, he showed up at my house late at night acting weird, so I told him to leave."

"Define ‘weird,’" Natalie pressed.

"He got jealous when Liam mentioned—" I caught myself before saying Damian’s name. "Liam mentioned something about suitors, and Ethan lost it. Said I belonged to him and he wouldn’t let me ‘whore myself to other men.’"

Even now, his words pissed me off. Belonged to him? Since when? And I wasn’t some object—I was a person.

"Ooh, possessive. Never thought I’d see the day Ethan Blackwood got possessive over you," Amelia said dreamily.

I stared at her like she’d lost her mind.

"Are you serious? This is Ethan. The same man who told me repeatedly that I meant nothing to him. That he’d never love me because he hated me."

The pain had mostly turned to anger. All that heartbreak—for what? He was still a thorn in my side.

"I think he’s finally realized he wants you. Why else would he—"

3/5



"Even if that’s true—which I doubt—it doesn’t matter. It’s too late. I gave him nine years of chances, and he wasted every one. All he gave me was pain. I don’t see things the way you do."

They fell silent, staring at me like they wanted to argue but didn’t know how. Right now, I just wanted to drop the Ethan topic. I had enough on my plate without adding him to the mix.

"Look, I know you want me happy, and for some reason, you think that’s with Ethan. But you’re wrong. Our marriage was doomed from the start. We’re toxic. I loved and hated him simultaneously, while he only hated me. I changed myself trying to make him love me, and it didn’t work. Even if I tried now, it wouldn’t matter. Any love I had is buried under pain, resentment, and bitterness. So please—drop it."

You can’t force the heart to want what it doesn’t. That’s what they were trying to do—manufacture feelings that didn’t exist. They wanted my fairytale ending to be with Ethan. Why couldn’t they understand that wanting him to love me didn’t make it real?

Sure, Ethan was acting different, but it was just a phase. Men always wanted what they couldn’t have. Soon, he’d get bored and return to his true love. If I gave in, I’d be left heartbroken all over again.

"Let’s focus on why we’re here," I said after the silence stretched too long.

"Fine," Amelia grumbled.

"Alright," Natalie agreed.

I sighed in relief. For now, they’d let it go—though I knew Amelia would bring it up again later.

"Can we go somewhere else? This pretentious place is getting on my nerves with all these snobby waiters," Amelia said suddenly.

"We could go to my restaurant," Natalie offered.



I didn’t know why they hadn’t thought of that earlier. Instead of commenting, I stayed quiet.

"Nah. Have you ever been to a fast-food place or an ice cream shop?" Amelia turned to Natalie, whose eyes darted nervously.

She shook her head. "Not really."

"Perfect. Today’s your lucky day. We’re having lunch at a burger joint, then froyo, then we’ll head to your office to discuss business."

I smirked at Natalie’s deer-in-headlights expression. It was time she experienced the real world—which, in my opinion, was far better than the stuck-up circles we usually moved in.

Amelia tugged Natalie up while I stood.

"What if I get food poisoning? I’ve heard those places aren’t hygienic," Natalie protested, trying to wiggle free.

"So what? You’ll spend a few days glued to the toilet, then be fine. Trust me—greasy food beats this fancy crap any day," Amelia said.

Laughing, I followed them out, listening to their bickering. It was refreshing.

I was just thinking how grateful I was for them when a venomous voice shattered my joy.

"Well, well. Look who it is—the pregnant slut."

I turned to see Olivia glaring at me with pure hatred. And standing right beside her?

Isabella.

I closed my eyes and exhaled. Why does the universe hate me so much?
###Chapter 95

The moment Sophia stepped into the dimly lit hospital corridor, her pulse quickened.

The sterile scent of antiseptic filled the air, sharp and unforgiving.

Her fingers trembled as she clutched the strap of her bag.

Liam had been rushed here after the accident.

She had barely processed Ethan’s frantic call before racing to the hospital, her mind a whirlwind of fear.

Now, standing outside the emergency room, she forced herself to breathe.

The door swung open, and Dr. Bennett emerged, her expression unreadable.

Sophia’s heart lodged in her throat.

"Mrs. Blackwood," the doctor began.

Sophia flinched at the title she no longer carried.

But she didn’t correct her. Not now.

"Liam is stable," Dr. Bennett continued. "He has a concussion and a fractured wrist, but he’ll recover."

Relief crashed over Sophia like a wave.

Then the doctor’s gaze darkened.

"But there’s something else."

Sophia stiffened.

"During the examination, we found traces of a sedative in his system."

Sophia’s blood ran cold.

A sedative?

Liam hadn’t been given anything—unless someone had slipped it to him.

Her mind raced.

Who would do this?

And why?

Before she could voice her thoughts, heavy footsteps echoed down the hall.

Ethan Blackwood strode toward them, his face a mask of fury.

His sharp eyes locked onto Sophia.

"What the hell happened?" he demanded.

Sophia recoiled at the accusation in his tone.

"I don’t know," she said, her voice steady despite the storm inside her.

Ethan’s jaw clenched.

"You were the last one with him before the accident."

Sophia’s breath hitched.

That wasn’t true.

She had dropped Liam off at school.

Unless…

Unless someone had taken him after.

Her stomach twisted.

Ethan stepped closer, his presence suffocating.

"If anything happens to my son—"

"Your son?" Sophia cut in, her voice icy. "You didn’t even want him until now."

Ethan’s expression darkened.

Before he could respond, a nurse hurried over.

"Mr. Blackwood, your mother is on the phone. She’s insisting on speaking with you."

Ethan exhaled sharply, then turned away, pulling out his phone.

Sophia watched him go, her thoughts racing.

Someone had targeted Liam.

And she would find out who.

No matter the cost.

She turned back to Dr. Bennett.

"I need to see him."

The doctor nodded.

"Follow me."

As Sophia stepped into Liam’s room, her heart shattered.

Her little boy lay still, his face pale against the white sheets.

She moved to his side, gently brushing his hair back.

Then she noticed something clutched in his hand.

A small, crumpled note.

Carefully, she pried it free and unfolded it.

The message was short.

But it sent a chill down her spine.

"You should have stayed gone."

Lucas had called the moment he saw my missed call. His voice was apologetic as he explained he’d been in a meeting, his phone silenced.

He wanted to rush home immediately, but I assured him everything was under control. That Hunter was fine now—no more tears, no more sadness.

For me, that was enough.

He hesitated but finally agreed to stay when I reminded him his meeting would run late.

Now, here I was, preparing dinner while my mind raced. It felt like my thoughts were a storm I couldn’t escape—especially the new ones about Hunter.

What was it about him that unsettled me so much?

“What’s for dinner, Mom?” Liam asked, sliding onto a stool at the kitchen island.

“Yeah, what? I’m starving,” Hunter added, flashing me that smile again.

That damn smile.

It wasn’t that I hated it. I could never hate any expression from Hunter. But something about it bothered me. There was a familiarity I couldn’t place.

“Not sure yet,” I admitted. “Let’s see what my cravings decide.”

Liam grinned and nudged Hunter. “Mom’s cravings are wild. Sometimes amazing, sometimes… questionable.”

Hunter chuckled. “Can I help?”

“Of course. Want to handle the chicken?”

Liam was a disaster in the kitchen, so he usually stayed out unless it was foolproof. I handed Hunter the marinated chicken breasts and seasoned flour, watching as he eagerly took them.

One thing I’d learned? The boy loved cooking. Some woman would be lucky to have him one day.

“Liam, you’re on dessert duty,” I said.

“At least that’s hard to mess up,” he joked, making us both laugh.

I loved his self-awareness.

“Hunter, careful with the marinade—don’t rub your eyes. The Tabasco will burn,” I warned.

He nodded, and we fell into an easy rhythm, chatting and laughing. My heart swelled seeing him like this—happy.

I couldn’t erase his pain, but I could give him moments like this.

He was such a sweet boy. Shy at first, but once he opened up? Pure sunshine.

Which made it worse that his mother wanted nothing to do with him.

From what little I’d gathered, she’d walked away. Whether by choice or circumstance, it didn’t matter—it hurt him. The last thing I wanted was for him to grow up broken, like me.

“This is what I’ve always wished for,” Hunter murmured suddenly.

“What?” Liam asked.

Hunter took a deep breath. “This. Having a mom beside me, cooking together. Dad’s amazing, but… he’s not her.”

My heart shattered.

If I could, I’d give him the world. But some things were impossible—like Liam wishing Ethan and I would reunite.

“You okay, sweetheart?” I asked softly.

He smiled up at me. “Yeah. I have you, Liam, and Dad. That’s enough. You’re not my real mom, but… you feel like one.”

I abandoned the food and pulled him into a hug, pressing a kiss to his forehead.

“Damn,” Liam muttered.

“Language!” I scolded.

He sighed. “Sorry, Mom. I’ve been pushing you and Dad without realizing how lucky I am to have you both. Will you forgive me?”

I opened my arms, and he stepped into them. “Forgiven.”

“I’ll still hope,” he whispered. “But I’ll stop pushing.”

“Thank you.”

We finished cooking, set the table, and devoured dinner—almost everything. I saved leftovers for Lucas, knowing he’d come home exhausted.

After baths and bedtime, an idea struck me.

I had a five-bedroom house. One was a nursery, but the last spare room?

It could be Hunter’s.

A place for him to stay, to feel safe. Excitement bubbled as I grabbed a notepad, scribbling down everything he’d need.

I’d ask Lucas, but I was sure he’d agree. He knew Hunter best—he could help design it.

The doorbell rang as I finished my list.

Lucas stood there, exhaustion lining his face.

“Hey,” I said.

“Hey,” he replied with a tired smile.

We moved to the living room.

“They’re asleep?” he asked.

“Yeah.”

I hesitated, then broached the subject carefully. “About today… Hunter was upset about his mother.”

His expression turned to ice.

“Don’t mention her,” he hissed. “She’s done nothing but hurt us. What kind of woman abandons her child? I accepted that she’d never love me, but him? That’s unforgivable.”

His voice was raw, pain bleeding through.

Unrequited love. A familiar agony.

“Every call she ignores kills me,” he continued. “He’s perfect, and she doesn’t want him. I tried shielding him, but he knows now. And I—God, I hate her, but I can’t stop loving her.”

His words mirrored my own to Ethan. Regretting her means regretting Hunter.

“Just love him,” I said softly. “Make sure he never doubts he’s enough.”

He nodded, silent.

“Thank you, Sophia. For being there for us.”

“Always.”

He left with a sleeping Hunter and the food I’d saved.

Hours later, in bed, Hunter’s smile still haunted me.

There was something I was missing.

If only I could figure out why it unsettled me so much.

###Chapter 96

My sneakers pound against the pavement as I push myself harder. Normally, I run at dawn, but tonight, I needed the burn. The evening air was thick, the sky painted in shades of twilight.

I increase my pace, muscles screaming in protest. I wasn’t just running—I was fleeing. Fleeing from the guilt gnawing at my soul. Fleeing from the ache in my chest.

Fleeing from my own damn stupidity.

The weight of how I’d hurt Sophia was crushing me. Consuming me. I hadn’t been able to face her since realizing the truth—that I was in love with her.

Every time I looked in the mirror, all I saw was a man who didn’t deserve her. A man who had taken her love for granted.

I used to think I was honorable. A man who loved fiercely, who never let go. I prided myself on holding onto my feelings for Isabella. I thought it proved my devotion.

But all it really proved was how blind I’d been.

While clinging to a ghost, I’d broken the heart of the woman I truly loved.

“Damn it!” I curse under my breath.

How the hell had I let things get this bad?

I push harder, passing the gas station near my estate. Slowing down wasn’t an option. If I stopped, the memories would swallow me whole.

Every time I closed my eyes, I saw Sophia’s face—months ago, right before she asked for the divorce. I couldn’t even remember what cruel words I’d thrown at her. But I remembered the way her eyes had dimmed. The way she’d whispered, I hate you.

I’d scoffed.

Now, I’d give anything to hear her say she loved me again.

I’d ruined everything. And I had no idea how to fix it.

My phone buzzes, yanking me from my spiraling thoughts.

“Yeah?” I answer without checking the caller ID, my breaths ragged.

“Dad! It’s me!” Liam’s excited voice crackles through the line.

We’d spoken on the phone, but I hadn’t visited. Not when seeing him meant facing her.

“Hey, buddy. What’s up?”

“I’m so excited!” he practically shouts.

Curiosity claws at me, even though a part of me knows I’ll regret asking.

“Why? What’s got you this hyped?” I force a chuckle.

Talking to him was the only thing keeping me sane right now. The only anchor in this storm.

“Okay, so you remember my best friend, Oliver?”

“Yeah.”

“Well, he’s been kinda down lately, so I talked to Mom, and she agreed—we’re all going to the amusement park tomorrow! Mom, me, Oliver, and his dad!”

Jealousy coils in my gut like a venomous snake. The thought of another man near her—touching her—made my blood boil.

I’d told myself she deserved better.

But hell if I’d let her move on without a fight.

“That so?” My voice turns sharp.

“Yeah! Aren’t you happy for me?” His excitement falters. “Dad… you okay? You sound weird.”

I pivot, stalking back toward my house. Every step fueled by fury—at myself, at this Lucas Montgomery, at the world.

What if she fell for him? What if she let him into her life? Into Liam’s life?

The possibilities made me sick.

“Where’s this amusement park?” I ask tightly.

“The next town over,” he says. “Dad, seriously—are you okay?”

“Fine. Perfect,” I lie through my teeth.

“O…kay.” He sounds skeptical. “Anyway, just wanted to let you know I won’t be home tomorrow. In case you wanted to visit. Night, Dad.”

“Night, Liam.”

I end the call, my grip on the phone dangerously tight.

The run had been pointless. Instead of clearing my head, I was angrier than ever.

By the time I reach my estate, my nerves are frayed. I want to storm into Sophia’s house, claim her, demand she cancel this damn outing.

But I had no right.

Not yet.

“Mr. Blackwood,” Winston, my butler, greets me as I step inside. “You have a visitor.”

Before he can elaborate, her voice cuts through the foyer.

I turn, jaw clenched.

Isabella.

Of all the damn times.

“What do you want, Isabella?” I snap as Winston discreetly exits.

She studies me, her beauty as striking as ever—but it did nothing for me now. The fire I’d once felt for her was ash.

“I missed you, Ethan,” she says softly.

I don’t have the patience for this.

“Cut the crap. Why are you here?”

Her face falls. “I came to talk about us.”

A cold laugh escapes me. “There is no ‘us.’ How many times do I have to say it?”

She flinches but doesn’t back down. “You love me. You always have. Don’t tell me that’s changed.” Tears glisten in her eyes. “Is this about Sophia?”

The mention of Sophia’s name makes my chest tighten.

“Yes,” I say bluntly. “But it’s more than that. I don’t love you, Isabella. Maybe I did once. Not anymore. Stop wasting your time.”

Her tears spill over. “You love her?”

The pain in her voice tugs at something in me—old instincts, old loyalties. But I smother them.

“Yes. And I’m going to fight for her. So don’t get in my way.”

She lets out a broken laugh. “She’ll never take you back.”

I rake a hand through my hair. “Maybe not. But I’m not giving up.”

Isabella lifts her chin, defiance flashing through her tears. “Then neither will I. I lost you once, Ethan. I won’t lose you again.”

Before I can respond, she spins on her heel and storms out.

I head upstairs, shoving the encounter to the back of my mind.

None of it mattered.

Only Sophia did.

And it was time I proved it.
###Chapter 97

"Mom, are you almost done?" Liam's voice echoes through my bedroom door. "We're going to be late!"

"Just one more minute!" I call back, slipping into my sundress. The thin straps and knee-length hem make it perfect for today. Comfortable sandals complete the look—essential for all the walking we'll be doing.

My hair is swept into a loose ponytail, a few curls framing my face. Minimal makeup—just enough to look presentable without the effort.

Honestly, I wasn’t thrilled about today. Fatigue has been my constant companion lately, and I didn’t want to crash too soon. But the sheer excitement on Liam’s and Oliver’s faces changed my mind.

After last week’s ordeal, Oliver needed this. He needed joy, love, and new memories to overwrite the pain his mother left behind.

Purse in hand, I open the door to find Liam waiting impatiently.

"Finally! Let’s go!"

A car horn blares outside. Lucas and Oliver must already be in the driveway. We decided to ride together—Lucas’s SUV had more space, and he volunteered to drive.

"I’ve been counting down the days!" Liam tugs me gently down the stairs, careful of my condition. "I even called Dad last night. He sounded... off, but I told him I wouldn’t be home today."

My stomach twists at the mention of Ethan. Liam usually tells me before calling him. Why keep it a secret this time?

Pushing the unease aside, I focus on the present.

Outside, Liam bolts for the car while I lock up. Sliding into the passenger seat, I smile at Lucas and Oliver.

"Hey, you two!" I chirp, forcing brightness into my voice.

"Sophia!" Oliver bounces in his seat, grinning.

Lucas offers a quiet "Hey" before starting the engine.

Thirty minutes in, the boys haven’t lost an ounce of energy. They’re practically vibrating, listing every ride and snack they plan to conquer.

"They’re obsessed," Lucas murmurs, eyes flicking to me before returning to the road.

I laugh. "That’s putting it mildly. Liam barely slept. Woke me up at dawn like the world was ending."

Lucas chuckles—a real, deep sound that catches me off guard. I stare.

"What?" he asks when the laughter fades.

"Nothing. Just... I’ve never heard you laugh like that. It’s nice. You should do it more."

His smile vanishes, walls slamming back up.

The rest of the drive is quiet, save for the boys’ chatter. Their synchronicity is uncanny—finishing each other’s sentences, sharing inside jokes. Lucas finds it hilarious.

Finally, we arrive. The amusement park gates loom ahead, crowds swarming.

"Rides first!" the boys declare in unison, eyes sparkling.

"Rides it is," I agree, taking their hands as we dive into the chaos.

Two hours later, my feet ache, but my heart is full. I collapse onto a bench, watching Lucas, Oliver, and Liam play.

Rubbing my sore soles, nostalgia hits hard. This was what I’d wanted for my family—Ethan, Liam, and me. But Ethan always refused.

"I’ll spend time with my son—just not with you ruining it."

The memory stings. Aside from one forced vacation, we were never a trio. Just fragments.

A voice slices through my thoughts.

"I don’t like another man playing dad to my son."

Ice floods my veins.

Ethan.

Of course. I knew he’d show up.

This was about to be a disaster.
###Chapter 98

I turned slowly toward the familiar voice, my breath catching in my throat. There he was—Ethan Blackwood, sitting beside me as if my thoughts had summoned him. But that wasn’t the most shocking part. For the first time in all the years I’d known him, he wasn’t dressed in one of his signature tailored suits. Instead, he wore a fitted black V-neck and dark jeans, looking unfairly good.

“What are you doing here?” I managed to choke out, my voice barely above a whisper.

He shrugged, his expression casual, as if his presence here wasn’t completely absurd. “Liam mentioned you’d be here. So, here I am.”

I couldn’t take it. Without another word, I stood and walked away, ignoring him when he called my name.

The bathroom was my refuge. I splashed cold water on my face, trying to steady my racing heart. Why now? After all this time, why was he suddenly acting like this? Just when I had finally decided to move on, he decides to change? Life didn’t work that way.

I steeled myself. Whatever his reasons, it didn’t matter. We were over before we even began.

When I stepped back out, I collided with someone—someone whose cologne was unmistakable. I jerked away as if burned, my traitorous body reacting before my mind could catch up.

“Sophia,” Ethan murmured, his voice rough and deep.

“What do you want, Ethan?” I snapped. “What game are you playing now?”

I didn’t understand him, and part of me didn’t want to. All I knew was the pain he’d caused me. I refused to go through that again.

“No games,” he said, uncharacteristically hesitant. “I just need to talk to you. There’s something important I have to say.”

That caught my attention. Ethan Blackwood was many things—arrogant, ruthless, infuriating—but hesitant? Never.

I studied him. His gray eyes held mine with an intensity I’d never seen before. Something was different. Something had changed.

And then I noticed it—the way he shifted his weight, the slight tension in his jaw. He was nervous. Ethan Blackwood, nervous.

“What is it?” I folded my arms, tapping my foot impatiently.

Before he could answer, Lucas Montgomery appeared beside me, his stance protective as he glared at Ethan.

“Sophia, is he bothering you?” Lucas demanded.

Ethan sneered. “Of course it’s you. Always sniffing around what’s mine. First Isabella, now Sophia. Stay the hell away from her.”

Rage flared inside me. I wasn’t his. Never had been.

“You’re unbelievable,” Lucas snarled, fists clenched. “She’s not some damn trophy you can claim.”

The tension between them was suffocating. Lucas looked ready to lunge, while Ethan’s eyes burned with something dangerously close to jealousy.

“Stay out of this,” Ethan growled. “This is between Sophia and me.”

Lucas shoved him. Hard. Ethan barely stumbled, but the action was enough to ignite the fire between them.

“Guys, stop!” I pleaded, but neither listened.

A small crowd had gathered, phones already out, capturing the spectacle.

“Don’t touch me,” Ethan warned, stepping forward until they were nose to nose.

Lucas didn’t back down. “I’ve had enough of you controlling my life. Why don’t you just disappear?”

The venom in his voice stunned me. This wasn’t the Lucas I knew.

Ethan smirked. “Wishful thinking. Isabella never loved you, and Sophia won’t either. Her heart belongs to me.”

That did it. Lucas swung, his fist connecting with Ethan’s jaw. Ethan retaliated instantly, and within seconds, they were brawling like teenagers.

Security arrived, dragging them apart. We were escorted out, the boys trailing behind, their faces crestfallen.

“Come on, let’s go home,” I said softly, taking Liam and Oliver’s hands.

“Why were they fighting?” Liam asked, his voice small.

“Adults sometimes forget how to act like adults,” I muttered, my patience fraying.

Outside, Ethan was arguing with the manager, his arrogance in full display. “Do you know who I am? I could buy this damn place and fire every single one of you!”

Lucas paced nearby, glaring daggers at him.

I stepped in before things escalated further. “Enough!” I snapped. “You both embarrassed yourselves—and your sons—today. Was this really worth ruining their day?”

Ethan had the audacity to smirk at me. “I like this side of you. It’s—” He cut himself off, glancing at the boys.

I was done.

“I’m leaving,” I announced, turning away.

“Where are you going?” Ethan called after me.

“Anywhere far from the two of you.”

I hailed a cab, ushering the boys inside. The fare didn’t matter. I just needed to get away.

“Can we get ice cream?” Oliver asked quietly.

I exhaled, forcing a smile. “Of course.”

Anything to erase the disaster of today.
###Chapter 99

My head felt like it was about to explode, scattering fragments of my sanity across the living room. Peace? Nonexistent.

Thoughts raced through my mind like a relentless storm. Unstoppable. Unyielding. It was driving me to the brink of madness.

"Alright, Elizabeth, focus on the dichotomous key and the insects we're studying," I instructed one of my tutoring students. "Mastering this means paying attention to both."

I'd hoped teaching would distract me. I was wrong. My mind kept drifting, no matter how hard I tried to anchor it.

Elizabeth nodded, signaling she understood.

"The first characteristic—large wings versus small or no wings. What’s the answer?"

She studied the textbook, hesitating at first before finally speaking. "Only the butterfly has large wings here, so it goes under that category."

I smiled, relieved she grasped it. "Good. The rest fall under small or no wings. Since there are many, we'll subdivide further. What should the next categories be?"

Her gaze flickered between the book and me, nervous.

"Take your time," I reassured her softly.

Patience was key in teaching. Not every student learned at the same pace, and that was perfectly fine.

"I'm not sure if I'm right," she admitted.

"That’s okay. If you’re wrong, we’ll figure it out together."

She exhaled. "Long rear legs or short rear legs?"

"Excellent. Now, which insects belong where?"

Her confidence returned, and she answered flawlessly. I clapped, praising her effort—everyone deserved recognition for progress.

"Thank you, Sophia," she beamed at the door after our session. "You make Biology so much clearer."

"Anytime, sweetheart."

Once she left, I collapsed onto the couch, my mind still restless. Gardening. Maybe that would help.

Liam was at Hunter’s house, so I was alone.

I changed into old clothes and headed to the backyard, kneeling in the soil with carrot and tomato seeds. The rhythmic motions usually soothed me, but today, my thoughts refused to quiet.

Gunner’s mother. Lucas’s cryptic words to Ethan. Something about it all gnawed at me.

"You seem lost."

I startled, looking up to find Lucas standing before me. How long had he been there?

"Yeah… just a lot on my mind. Thought this might help," I admitted, brushing dirt off my jeans.

"Anything I can help with?"

"Probably not."

He was always tight-lipped about Hunter’s mother. Married? Divorced? Just a fling? I doubted he’d ever willingly share. And every mention of her seemed to either anger or pain him.

"That’s fine. I usually process things alone too," he said, then gestured to the garden. "But I can help with this."

"Thanks." I handed him gloves, and he knelt beside me.

"What are the boys up to?"

"Video games. It’s surreal how close they’ve become. Inseparable. Never thought I’d see the day, considering how much I despise Ethan."

I frowned. He couldn’t even say his name. Why?

"Why the hatred? Whatever happened was years ago. Shouldn’t you have moved on by now?" I asked, referencing his high school obsession with Isabella.

He’d been infatuated, trailing after her like a lovesick puppy—letters, flowers, gifts. It had infuriated Ethan endlessly.

"It’s nothing," he muttered, but the lie was obvious.

I let it drop.

"Regardless, you need to set it aside. Our sons are best friends. You’ll see Ethan occasionally. No more picking fights."

I made a mental note to have the same talk with Ethan. They needed to grow up.

"This isn’t about you or Ethan. It’s about Hunter and Liam."

Thinking of Hunter summoned an image I couldn’t shake. A smile. His smile.

My blood ran cold.

It couldn’t be. She would’ve said something. Told her family. But the resemblance was undeniable.

"Sophia?" Lucas called, but I was trapped in the realization.

Hunter’s smile was identical to hers as a child.

"Isabella," I whispered, the name tearing from my lips.

Lucas went rigid beside me. His reaction confirmed it.

"I have to go." I stood shakily.

He grabbed my arm, searching my face. "You know."

I nodded, tears welling. Wrenching free, I hurried inside, grabbed my keys, and left.

I couldn’t believe it. Not her.

The Isabella I knew would never abandon her child. She wouldn’t be this cruel.

I needed answers. Now.
###Chapter 100

"Is Liam coming?" my mother asks me.

"Not today, Mom. I forgot to tell Sophia, and I didn’t want to drop this on her unexpectedly," I reply as I step into Victoria’s house.

It was our monthly family gathering. Just like last time, I didn’t want to be here. The only reason I showed up was because I’d promised Mom I would.

"I’ve missed him so much, and so has Victoria. She was really looking forward to seeing him." She hesitates. "Now that she and Sophia aren’t speaking, these gatherings are the only chance she gets to see Liam."

I should feel sorry for her, but I don’t. Maybe that makes me a jerk, but I believe we’re all getting what we deserve. This is our punishment for how we treated Sophia.

"Maybe next time," I mutter, brushing past her.

Mom and Victoria have been best friends for decades. She’d do anything for her. The last thing I need is to stand there for half an hour listening to how Victoria is suffering.

I have enough of my own suffering to deal with.

She trails behind me as I head to the backyard. I know this house like my own. They’ve lived here forever. This is where Sophia and I got married. Where she tried to run when she found out she was pregnant with Liam.

I stop abruptly.

Mom, who was right behind me, bumps into my back.

"What the hell, Ethan?" she snaps, but I don’t turn around. I can’t.

She steps in front of me when I don’t respond. My gaze is distant, unfocused.

"Ethan? What’s wrong?"

I swallow hard, struggling to speak.

"I just remembered the day I caught Sophia trying to leave. Looking back now… I don’t know what my life would’ve been like if she’d gotten away."

"Ethan, sweetheart, don’t dwell on that. It didn’t happen, and we should be grateful."

I sigh, remembering how stupid I’d been.

"Sophia was eighteen and terrified, Mom. She begged me to let her go because she knew—somehow, she knew—that staying would destroy her. And I did. I broke her heart over and over. Now, I don’t know what to think. Part of me wishes I’d let her leave. Maybe she wouldn’t be this broken. The other part is glad I stopped her because I wouldn’t have Liam. Or gotten to know the incredible woman she is."

The crushing guilt hits me every time I remember what I put her through. I should’ve tried harder. Maybe then I wouldn’t be drowning in regret.

"You’re carrying too much blame, Ethan. Yes, you hurt her, but we all did. Both families played a part in breaking her. You’re not the only one responsible for the damage." Mom grips my arm, trying to comfort me.

"Your mother’s right." I turn to see my father standing by the sliding doors.

"We all hurt Sophia. We forgot she came into our lives as a baby. We forgot the joy she brought. We forgot she needed love. That’s on us. We were the adults. You kids followed our lead. We pushed her away, and you did the same. If anyone’s to blame, it’s us. We failed her." He clamps a firm hand on my shoulder.

Their words are meant to comfort me, but they don’t. The others ignored Sophia. I did worse. So much worse. And that’s entirely on me.

I force a small smile. I don’t want to linger on this.

Mom must take the hint because she tugs my hand.

"Come on, let’s go before everyone wonders where we are," she says, pulling me along as Dad follows.

I internally groan when I spot Isabella. I knew she’d be here, but knowing and seeing are two different things.



"Hey, Ethan. I’m glad you came." Victoria kisses both my cheeks.

"Yeah," I reply flatly, because I’m not glad to be here.

She gets distracted by my parents, giving me the perfect chance to slip away.

I head straight for Sebastian.

"How’s it going?" he asks after we exchange greetings.

"Terrible," I mutter, thinking about my fight with Lucas last weekend.

Not my finest moment, but he reminded me too much of how he used to chase Isabella. It scared me because I thought he might do the same to Sophia. Lucas is a good guy—that’s what terrifies me the most. It means he actually has a shot if he tries.

"Any progress?" he asks.

"None. Unless you count pissing her off even more."

Sebastian sighs. "What did you do?"

"I got into a fight with Lucas. Turns out he’s Hunter’s father."

I don’t need to explain who Hunter is. Liam talks about him constantly. He’s his new best friend.

"Wait, who’s Lucas?" Sebastian looks confused.

"Nerdy Lucas. Remember him?"

It takes a second, but then it clicks.

"You’re kidding me!" he exclaims. "That nerdy Lucas? The one who followed Isabella everywhere?"

"The same one."

I still can’t believe it. The coincidence is insane.

"What’s going on?" Nathan asks as he joins us.

I glance behind him, relieved Isabella isn’t following. In fact, now that I think about it, she’s been keeping her distance. If that means she stays away from Sophia, I’m fine with it.



"Just found out nerdy Lucas is Hunter’s dad, and Ethan got into a fight with him," Sebastian answers.

"Seriously?" Nathan turns to me. "Why? Because of Isabella?"

Before I can respond, the front door slams open. Moments later, Sophia’s furious voice echoes through the house.

"Isabella!" she shouts, storming into the backyard.

"What’s going on?" I ask Nathan.

"No idea."

We move closer, watching as Sophia marches toward Isabella, who’s standing with our parents. Before anyone can react, Sophia slaps her so hard she stumbles to the ground.

"What the hell, Sophia?" Nathan yells, rushing to help his sister.

Isabella, like everyone else, is stunned. Sophia, on the other hand, looks furious. Like she’s ready to tear someone apart.

"Shut the fuck up, Nathan," she hisses through clenched teeth.

"Sophia, what’s going on? Why would you attack your sister like this?" Victoria asks, tears in her eyes.

She’s torn. She doesn’t know which daughter to defend, so she’s waiting to see if Sophia has a valid reason.

This is how much she’s changed. The old Victoria would’ve taken Isabella’s side instantly.

"That’s what I want to know," Sophia snarls, glaring at Isabella. "I want to know why you’d abandon your child. Your own son."

We all freeze. Maybe we heard wrong. Maybe Sophia’s mistaken. There’s no way Isabella has a child. She would’ve told us.

"That’s bullshit. Isabella doesn’t have a kid, and she’d never abandon one," Nathan defends.

Sophia laughs, like she’s lost her mind.

"That’s what I thought too. But I’m not wrong."

Isabella clings to Nathan, trembling, tears streaming down her face. But she doesn’t deny it.

Sophia stares at her like she’s filth.

"You’re Hunter’s mother, aren’t you, Isabella? Or are you going to keep pretending?"

The final blow lands. One none of us saw coming. One none of us were ready for.

###Chapter 101

The air in the penthouse was thick with tension.

Sophia's eyes burned with a fire I hadn't seen in years.

She stood before me, her fists clenched, her breathing ragged.

"You had no right," she spat, her voice trembling with barely contained rage.

I remained silent, watching her.

The accusations in her glare were sharper than any blade.

"Did you think I wouldn't find out?" she demanded.

Her words sliced through the quiet like a whip.

I exhaled slowly, bracing myself.

This storm had been brewing for weeks.

"You kept him from me," she continued, her voice cracking. "My own son!"

The pain in her voice was raw, unfiltered.

Liam.

The name hung between us like a ghost.

I had my reasons.

But none of them would justify this betrayal in her eyes.

"You don't understand," I began, but she cut me off.

"Understand?" she laughed bitterly. "You stole years of his life from me!"

Her tears fell freely now, but her anger didn't waver.

I took a step forward.

She recoiled as if burned.

That small movement shattered something inside me.

"I was protecting him," I said quietly.

Her laugh was hollow. "From what? From me?"

The accusation stung more than I expected.

"No," I said firmly. "From everything else."

She shook her head, disbelief written across her face.

"You don't get to decide that," she whispered.

The silence that followed was deafening.

Then she turned on her heel and walked out.

The door slammed behind her with finality.

I stood there, staring at the empty space she'd left behind.

The weight of my choices pressed down on me.

This wasn't over.

Not by a long shot.

But for the first time, I wondered if I'd gone too far.

And if she'd ever forgive me.

“Is Liam coming?” my mother asks me.

“Not today, Mom. I forgot to tell Sophia, and I didn’t want to spring this on her last minute,” I say as I step into Victoria’s house.

It was our monthly family gathering. Just like last time, I didn’t want to be here. The only reason I showed up was because I’d promised Mom I would.

“I’ve missed him so much, and so has Victoria. She was really looking forward to seeing him.” She hesitates. “Now that she and Sophia aren’t speaking, these gatherings are the only time she gets to see Liam.”

I should feel sorry for her, but I don’t. Maybe that makes me a jerk, but I believe we’re all getting exactly what we deserve. This is our punishment for how we treated Sophia.

“Maybe next time,” I mutter, brushing past her.

Mom and Victoria have been best friends for decades. She’d move mountains for her. The last thing I need is to stand there for half an hour listening to how Victoria is suffering.

I have enough suffering of my own to deal with.

She trails behind me as I head to the backyard. I know this house like my own. They’ve lived here forever. This is where Sophia and I got married. Where she tried to run when she found out she was pregnant with Liam.

I stop abruptly.

Mom, who was right behind me, bumps into my back.

“What the hell, Ethan?” she snaps, but I don’t turn around. I can’t.

She steps in front of me when I don’t respond. My gaze is distant, unfocused.

“Ethan? What’s wrong?”

I swallow hard, struggling to speak.

“I just remembered the day I caught Sophia trying to leave. Looking back now… I don’t know what my life would’ve been like if she’d gotten away.”

Mom sighs. “Sweetheart, don’t dwell on that. It didn’t happen, and we should be grateful.”

I shake my head.

“Sophia was eighteen and terrified, Mom. She begged me to let her go because she knew—somehow, she knew—that staying would destroy her. And I did. I broke her heart over and over. Now? I don’t know what to think. Part of me wishes I’d let her leave. Maybe she wouldn’t be this broken. But the other part? The selfish part? I’m glad I stopped her. Because I wouldn’t have Liam. I wouldn’t have known the incredible woman she became.”

The weight of my regrets crushes me every time I think about what I put her through. I should’ve tried harder. Maybe then I wouldn’t feel this suffocating guilt.

“You’re carrying too much blame, Ethan. Yes, you hurt her, but you’re not the only one. Both our families played a part in breaking her. You’re not solely responsible for her pain.” Mom squeezes my arm, trying to comfort me.

“Your mother’s right.” I turn to see Dad standing by the sliding doors.

“We all failed Sophia. We forgot she came into our lives as a little girl. We forgot the joy she brought. We forgot she needed love. That’s on us. We were the adults. You kids followed our lead. If anyone’s to blame, it’s us.” His grip on my shoulder is firm.

Their words are meant to comfort me, but they don’t. The others ignored her. I did worse. So much worse. And that’s entirely on me.

I force a small smile. I don’t want to linger on this.

Mom seems to take the hint. She tugs my hand.

“Come on, let’s go before everyone wonders where we are.”

I groan internally when I spot Isabella. I knew she’d be here, but knowing and seeing her are two different things.



“Ethan! I’m so glad you came.” Victoria kisses my cheeks.

“Yeah,” I reply flatly.

She’s quickly distracted by my parents, giving me the perfect chance to slip away.

I head straight for Sebastian.

“How’s it going?” he asks after we exchange greetings.

“Terrible,” I grumble, thinking about my fight with Lucas last weekend.

Not my finest moment, but hearing about how he used to chase Isabella scared me. Because what if he’s doing the same to Sophia? Lucas is a good guy. That’s what terrifies me—because it means he actually has a shot with her.

“Any progress?” he asks.

“None. Unless you count pissing her off even more.”

Sebastian sighs. “What did you do?”

“Got into a fight with Lucas. Turns out he’s Hunter’s father.”

I don’t need to explain who Hunter is. Liam talks about him nonstop. Calls him his new best friend.

Sebastian blinks. “Wait—Lucas? As in Nerdy Lucas? The one who followed Isabella around?”

“The very same.”

I still can’t believe it. The coincidence is insane.

“What’s going on?” Nathan asks, joining us.

I glance behind him, relieved Isabella isn’t following. Honestly, as long as she stays far away from Sophia, I don’t care.



“Just found out Nerdy Lucas is Hunter’s dad, and Ethan got into a fight with him,” Sebastian explains.

Nathan’s eyes widen. “Seriously? Was it because of Isabella?”

Before I can answer, the front door slams open.

A second later, Sophia’s furious voice echoes through the house.

“Isabella!” she shouts, storming into the backyard.

Nathan and I exchange glances.

“What’s happening?” I ask.

“No idea.”

We move closer, watching as Sophia marches toward Isabella, who’s standing with our parents. Before anyone can react, Sophia slaps her—hard. Isabella stumbles back, falling to the ground.

“What the hell, Sophia?” Nathan yells, rushing to his sister’s side.

Isabella looks stunned. Sophia? She looks furious. Like she’s ready to tear someone apart.

“Shut up, Nathan,” she snaps, teeth clenched.

Victoria’s eyes fill with tears. “Sophia, what’s going on? Why would you hit your sister?”

She’s torn. The old Victoria would’ve taken Isabella’s side immediately. But now? She’s waiting to hear Sophia’s side first.

That alone shows how much she’s changed.

Sophia glares at Isabella. “I want to know why you did it, Isabella. Why would you abandon your own child? Your son?”

The backyard goes silent.

No one moves. No one breathes.

This can’t be real. Isabella would never—

“That’s bullshit!” Nathan defends. “Isabella doesn’t have a kid. She’d never do that.”

Sophia laughs, but it’s hollow. Unhinged.

“That’s what I thought too. But I’m not wrong.”

Isabella clings to Nathan, trembling. Tears streak down her face. Fear fills her eyes.

But she doesn’t deny it.

Sophia stares at her like she’s trash.

“You’re Hunter’s mother, aren’t you? Or are you going to keep pretending?”

The bombshell drops.

None of us saw it coming.

None of us were ready.

###Chapter 102

Victoria collapses into the chair after my confession. The devastation in her eyes is unraveling me.

Nathan, who had been holding me, releases me as if I’ve scorched him. He steps back slowly, putting distance between us.

I know the others are stunned, but their reactions don’t matter right now. Not when my own family is staring at me like I’m a stranger.

"Tell me this is some twisted joke," Victoria pleads, her voice trembling. "Tell me you didn’t hide a child from us all these years."

I wish I could lie. Just to erase the heartbreak in their eyes. But the truth is out now. There’s no escaping it.

"I’m sorry," I sob, stumbling toward her. "I wanted to tell you, but I was so ashamed."

I reach for her hand, but she flinches away.

This is exactly what I feared. Sophia was right. I was the golden child—the one who never faltered, the one who thought before acting.

Except for that one mistake.

Now they see me for what I truly am. Flawed. Human. The advantage I held over Sophia is gone.

I’m just like her now.

"How?" Nathan demands, pacing angrily. "When did this happen? Did Dad know?"

"No. Only Lucas and Evelyn knew." I can’t bring myself to meet Victoria’s gaze.

"Start from the beginning," Victoria snaps, her voice sharp. "I want to know why you kept my grandson a secret."

I don’t want to relive this, but I have no choice.

"After Ethan married Sophia, I was shattered. I pretended to be fine—for you, for Dad, for Nathan. But I was drowning. When I went back to school, I fell into depression."

I sink onto the grass, feeling as small as I did the day I learned Ethan had slept with Sophia.

"I stopped eating. Stopped sleeping. Barely left my room. Evelyn noticed. She threatened to call you if I didn’t get help. I couldn’t let you see me like that. I couldn’t let Sophia know she’d broken me."

The bitterness I felt toward Sophia back then was suffocating.

"Eventually, I got better. Evelyn became my anchor. My grades improved. I stopped crying over Ethan." I take a shaky breath. "Then I ran into Lucas again. We went to the same university. He was Evelyn’s project partner."

"We barely spoke. I tolerated him for Evelyn’s sake. When he didn’t act obsessed like in high school, I relaxed. We coexisted."

This is agony. I want to stop, but they won’t let me.

"Things were okay for a while. Then Evelyn called to tell me Sophia had given birth to a boy. That Ethan adored his son the moment he saw him." My voice cracks. "Everything shattered. All the pain I’d buried resurfaced."

"I was furious. At myself for rejecting Ethan’s proposal. At Ethan for sleeping with Sophia. At Sophia for marrying him. At the baby for existing."

A sharp inhale comes from Ethan. I don’t need to look to know it’s him.

"I wanted to hurt Ethan. I knew he hated Lucas for liking me, so I seduced him. I wanted word to get back to Ethan. I wanted him to feel what I felt."

I don’t tell them it was also how I lost my virginity. I’d saved myself for Ethan. Instead, I gave it to a man I didn’t love.

"I regretted it the next morning. I told Lucas it was a mistake. I snuck out, thinking that was the end."

But fate had other plans.

"My period was late. A test confirmed it. I was pregnant."

It was the worst moment of my life. I’d always believed Ethan and I would reconcile. A baby would ruin that.

"Why didn’t you take the morning-after pill?" Victoria asks.

"I was naive. It was my first time. I didn’t think once was enough." My cheeks burn. "If I’d told Evelyn, she would’ve made me take it. But I was too ashamed."

"You and Ethan never…?" Nathan asks, stunned.

Ethan groans. "Do we have to discuss this?"

"Yes, I was a virgin," I say flatly. "I told Lucas about the baby. I wanted an abortion, but he refused."

"You wanted to—?" Victoria’s voice is thick with horror.

I nod. "Lucas threatened to tell you if I went through with it. So I carried the baby. It was the worst nine months of my life."

"That’s why you disappeared," Nathan murmurs.

"I stayed off-campus with Lucas. When I gave birth, I told the nurses to give the baby to him. I didn’t want to see him. Hold him. Nothing."

"You didn’t even look at your own child?" Victoria whispers.

"No. To me, he was a mistake I wanted to forget."

Victoria stands abruptly. "You lived your life as if he never existed?"

"Mom—"

"Enough!" she shouts, then softer, "Enough. First your father. Then Sophia. Now this? I can’t even look at you."

She walks away, leaving me sobbing on the ground.

One by one, the others follow. Nathan is last.

He shakes his head in disgust. "I never expected this from you, Isabella. Never."

Then he’s gone.

I curl into myself, weeping. Everything was perfect before Sophia ruined it.

This is all her fault.

I’ll never forgive her.

Never.

###Chapter 103

Lucas

I wait. Not just patiently—agonizingly. The clock ticks louder with each passing minute. She stormed out hours ago, and though I don’t know exactly where she went, I can piece it together. Fury radiates off her in waves, and I get it. If anyone understands the rage Isabella’s actions have sparked, it’s me. She’s hurt Oliver and me in ways I’ll never voice aloud.

The door clicks open, but I don’t move. Why am I even here? Oliver’s safe at home with the nanny. Yet something roots me to this spot.

Sophia freezes when she sees me. Her eyes are swollen, lashes clumped with dried tears. “Lucas,” she breathes, voice raw. “You’re still here.”

Words clot in my throat. What do you say to someone whose pain mirrors your own?

“I waited,” I say as she sinks onto the couch. “Where’d you go?”

I know the first stop—the explosive confrontation with Isabella after realizing she’s Oliver’s mother. But that couldn’t have taken three hours.

“I drove.” Her whisper is frayed. “Just… drove. God, this is—” She presses her palms to her eyes. “It’s not just watching Oliver hurt. It’s seeing myself in him.”

I barely knew Sophia growing up. Two years ahead in school, I’d been too obsessed with Isabella to notice anyone else. Even now, I’ve kept walls up. It felt unfair to pry into her life when I’ve shared so little of mine. All I know is Ethan shattered her. Just like Isabella destroyed me.

“How?” I ask.

Her laugh is brittle. “Because I was him. Unwanted. Only worse—rejected by both my family and Ethan’s. I spent years begging for love that never came.”

My stomach twists. Unlike the guys who’d pursued her to get closer to Isabella, I’d never played those games. Using one sister to reach another? Disgusting.

“I’m sorry, Sophia.”

Pathetic. That’s all I can offer? I can’t even comfort my own son when he asks about Isabella.

She shakes her head. “Ancient history. But this isn’t about me. Tell me how Isabella became Oliver’s mother.”

I drag a hand down my face. Not because I won’t tell her—but because reliving it feels like tearing open a half-healed wound.

“You know I was obsessed with her in high school,” I start.

She nods. “Like I was with Ethan. Everyone knew.”

The irony isn’t lost on us. We got the people we wanted—only to wish we hadn’t.

“I tried everything to get her attention. But competing with Ethan? Impossible. I was the nerdy kid, Sophia. Zero appeal.”

She snorts. “Have you seen yourself in glasses? You’re every woman’s forbidden librarian fantasy.”

A surprised laugh escapes me. “Maybe now. Back then? Isabella looked at me like I was gum on her shoe. Can’t blame her—I wouldn’t have dated me either.”

College changed everything. I rebuilt myself—physically, socially. For the first time, girls noticed me. Parties. Hookups. No more pining for someone who’d never want me.

Then Grandpa had a stroke.

Sophia’s eyes widen. “You transferred to Ethan and Isabella’s university.”

“Yeah.” I exhale. “Saw them around, but kept my distance. Grandpa died soon after. When I returned to campus, the ‘IT couple’ had imploded. Ethan cheated—with you.”

Her flinch is barely there, but I catch it.

Isabella became a ghost after that. Hollow-eyed. Numb. I wanted to comfort her, but she’d never let me close. Fate intervened when my project partner turned out to be her roommate, Evelyn.

Sophia leans forward, riveted.

“I avoided Isabella. Then one night, she showed up at my dorm. Kissed me. Asked me to sleep with her.” My throat tightens. “I thought it meant something. Next morning? She looked at me like I’d assaulted her. Said she’d only used me to hurt Ethan.”

Sophia pales. “She told you about… me?”

“That’s how I found out.” The memory still stings. “Then she got pregnant. Wanted an abortion. I threatened legal action to stop her. Took her to Grandpa’s house, thinking—hoping—she’d grow to love the baby. Love me.”

I laugh bitterly. “She was vicious. We still slept together sometimes, but it didn’t erase the way she treated me. Cursed me. Cursed Oliver before he was born.”

Sophia’s grip on my hand tightens.

“When Oliver arrived, she refused to hold him. Left the hospital without a backward glance. A year later, she came back—for sex. Said other men ‘disgusted’ her.” Shame burns my cheeks. “I was exhausted. Lonely. I gave in.”

For years, it continued. She’d slip in, use me, vanish. No mention of Oliver. Until the day he caught her sneaking out. Seven years old, asking if the strange woman was his mom.

“I told him the truth. She screamed at me for it. Left without even looking at him.” My voice cracks. “That’s when I cut her off. Moved here for a fresh start. Never imagined you’d be next door—or that Isabella would follow.”

Sophia squeezes my hand. “You’re a good man, Lucas. You deserve real love.”

I pull her into a hug, breathing in the citrus of her shampoo. For the first time in years, the weight on my chest lightens.

I don’t tell her the rest—that I’m glad she’s here. That I wanted the truth about Isabella to come out. No more secrets. No more hiding what kind of woman she really is.
###Chapter 104

My mind was completely numb.

I'd been sitting motionless since Lucas left nearly an hour ago. I'd asked if Liam could stay the night at his place, and he'd agreed without hesitation.

The weight of today's revelations pressed down on me. Too much. Too fast. My thoughts spun in dizzying circles, unable to settle.

When my phone rang, I almost let it go to voicemail. But duty kicked in—what if it was urgent?

I answered without looking. Held the phone to my ear in silence. My throat felt too tight for words.

"Sophia?" The voice was breathless with concern. Amelia. "Thank God you picked up. Tristan told me what happened. Are you okay?"

"Honestly?" My whisper cracked. "I don't know."

How could Isabella be so cruel? To reject her own child simply because he didn't share Ethan's DNA? The calculated malice of it made my stomach churn.

"Tristan said you're the one who uncovered the truth. Who exposed Isabella's lies."

Hunter's pain resonated deep in my bones. That familiar sting of parental rejection. He hadn't asked to be born to such a woman, yet she'd treated him like a mistake to be erased. The injustice burned through me like acid.

"It was an accident, really."

"How?" Disbelief colored her tone. "How did you even suspect?"

"His smile." The memory surfaced vividly. "I'd seen it dozens of times before, but one day... it just clicked. That tilt at the corner of his mouth—identical to hers."

"Callum never mentioned anything?"

"Not a word. But when I said Isabella's name?" A humorless laugh escaped me. "He turned to stone. That told me everything. That, and his silence."

The surrealness of it still hadn't faded. How could a mother abandon her child? My chest ached at the thought of living without Liam.

"Walk me through it," Amelia urged.

So I did. From the first suspicion to today's explosive confrontation. By the time I finished, tears streaked my face again. I hadn't meant to break down, but the dam had burst.

"I didn't realize where I was driving until I pulled up to Victoria's house." The title 'mother' had long since turned to ash in my mouth. "This rage just... consumed me. For Hunter. For little me. I needed to do what no one ever did for us—stand up and scream how wrong it was."

A childhood prayer finally answered. All those adults who'd watched William and Victoria's neglect, Rowan's parents included, had chosen complicity over courage. But not this time. This time, someone fought back.

"I get it, sweetheart." Amelia's voice thickened. "No child deserves that kind of cruelty. You did the right thing—showing that witch for what she is."

Relief loosened the knot in my chest. Part of me had worried I'd overstepped, acted too rashly. But the moment I'd seen Hunter's face... rational thought had evaporated.

The doorbell cut through my thoughts.

"Someone's here. I have to go." Exhaustion dragged at every syllable.

"Get some rest. We'll talk tomorrow."

As I hung up, I seriously considered ignoring the visitor. But habit had me shuffling to the door.

The sight of Ethan Blackwood on my porch stole my breath.

"What are you doing here?" The words came out sharper than intended.

Honestly? I'd expected him to be comforting Isabella right now. His presence here felt... wrong.

"Can I come in?"

Against all logic, I stepped aside. His faint smile as he crossed the threshold sent an unwelcome flutter through me.

"Is Liam asleep?" He shrugged off his coat.

"Not here. He's staying at Lucas's tonight."

That familiar jealousy flashed in his eyes at Lucas's name. For a heartbeat, I braced for an outburst. But he swallowed it down with visible effort. Impressive control.

"Christ. What a fucking day." He scrubbed his face. "How are you holding up?"

The question startled me. This new version of Ethan still didn't compute. Old Ethan would've been screaming accusations by now, defending Isabella.

"Fine," I lied automatically, then corrected: "No, that's bullshit. I feel... flayed open."

He closed the distance between us in two strides.

And then his arms were around me.

Every inch of him pressed against me—hard planes to my soft curves. His heat seeped into my skin. I should've pushed him away. Should've screamed. But my body betrayed me, melting into the embrace.

"What do you need?" His breath stirred my hair. "This isn't just about Hunter, is it? It's reopening your own wounds."

My pulse stuttered. He understood. Actually understood.

I kept my gaze lowered, but his fingers gently tilted my chin up. His gray eyes held mine with an intensity that sent shivers down my spine. The way he looked at me now—like I was his entire world—was everything I'd once dreamed of.

And it terrified me.

"I know one way to distract you." His thumb traced my lower lip. "If I kiss you right now... will you let me?"

My heart hammered against my ribs.

Say no. The voice in my head screamed. Push him away.

But when his lips met mine, every protest dissolved.

The kiss started soft. Testing. Then his tongue swept in, and I was lost. My fingers tangled in his hair as the world narrowed to the slide of his mouth against mine. My knees buckled; only his arm around my waist kept me upright.

This was what authors meant by "earth-shattering." This all-consuming fire that burned away every rational thought. Daniel's kisses had never made me feel like this—like I'd die if we stopped.

And that's when the memory struck.

"You were a decent fuck, but let's be honest—you were never enough. Every time I was inside you, I imagined Isabella. Every time I came, it was her face I saw. You were just convenient. Easy."

His cruel words from months ago crashed over me like ice water.

I tore myself away, gasping.

"Sophia?" Confusion creased his brow.

"Every time I was inside you, I imagined Isabella," I quoted hoarsely. "You were just convenient. Easy."

His face paled. "Sophia, please—"

"Those were your exact words." Tears blurred my vision. "I was nothing but a placeholder for your precious Isabella."

Why did it still hurt so much? Because for one dangerous moment, I'd let myself believe the lie in his kiss.

"Listen to me—"

"Leave." The word came out broken.

He stood his ground. "Not until you hear me out."

Fine. If he wouldn't go, I would. I grabbed my keys.

"What are you doing?" Alarm sharpened his tone.

"You won't leave? Then I will."

I'd barely reached the hallway when he spoke again.

"I'll go. It's too late for you to be driving."

Silence stretched as he moved to the door. Just when I thought this nightmare was ending, he paused beside me. Before I could react, he tipped my chin up and brushed his lips against mine—softer this time—then my forehead.

I glared daggers.

He just smiled faintly and left.

The second his taillights disappeared, I deadbolted the door and fled upstairs. Changed clothes mechanically. Collapsed into bed.

But sleep wouldn't come.

That kiss haunted me. The way it made me feel—alive and wanted—was the most terrifying part.

This new Ethan was dangerous. Because no matter how much he'd changed, one truth remained:

No one could destroy me quite like Ethan Blackwood.
###Chapter 105

The golden sunlight streaming through my window coaxes my eyes open. Instead of rising immediately, I linger in bed, my hands resting on my rounded belly as I feel the tiny kicks of my baby.

A glance at the calendar on my nightstand confirms it—today marks six months. The journey of pregnancy is terrifying, filled with unknowns. Every milestone feels like a miracle, and I whisper a quiet prayer of gratitude, knowing not all babies make it this far.

After my moment of thanks, I drag myself downstairs. A shower can wait—hunger demands attention first. Yesterday’s chaos made me forget to eat entirely.

And thinking of yesterday brings me straight to him. Ethan.

I still can’t believe I let him kiss me. Worse? I liked it.

It gnaws at me how much I wanted more—his lips pressing harder, his hands exploring further. I could blame it on hormones, but that would be a lie.

Ethan shattered me. The fact that I craved him yesterday makes me despise myself just a little. I swore I’d moved on, yet there I was, tangled up with him in my own living room.

Part of me wants to believe he’s changed. But even if he has, isn’t it too late? The damage is done. The mess he left behind can’t be fixed.

I pull out ingredients for breakfast, desperate for distraction. But no matter how I try, my mind circles back to that kiss. Why did it wreck me so badly? I don’t understand.

A frustrated groan escapes me. I wish I could scrub the memory of his lips from mine.

“What’s got you so worked up?” Lucas’s voice startles me so badly I drop the eggs in my hands.

“Jesus, Lucas!” I press a hand to my racing heart. “You scared me half to death.”

He grins. “Sorry. Thought you heard us—Hunter and Liam weren’t exactly quiet coming in.”

I turn to see the boys already devouring yesterday’s cookies.

“It’s fine,” I mutter. “Just lost in thought.”

His grin fades. “Still thinking about what happened with Isabella yesterday?”

I nod. A lie, but he doesn’t need to know my thoughts were occupied by someone else entirely.

“What’s for breakfast, Mom?” Liam asks.

“Full English,” I answer.

“Yes!” Hunter pumps his fist. “Best breakfast ever—everything good in one plate.”

I smile, warmed by his excitement. I hope one day Isabella realizes her mistakes and fixes things with Hunter before it’s too late.

“Almost done?” Liam presses. “I’m starving.”

“Few more minutes. Go wait in the living room.”

They bolt off in unison.

Lucas takes the cleaning rag from me, wiping up my mess. “Sorry for barging in. They insisted on your cooking.”

I laugh. Lucas isn’t a bad cook—he just doesn’t make it my way. Their words, not mine.

“It’s fine. I’d have brought some over anyway.” I return to the sizzling pan.

“How are you holding up?” I ask.

“Good.” He exhales. “Relieved everyone knows about Hunter now. He’s an incredible kid—he shouldn’t be hidden like some dirty secret. After my grandfather died, it was just me… until Hunter. I never minded, but it wasn’t fair to him, knowing his mother had a whole family out there. He deserves to know his uncle and grandmother.”

Nathan and Victoria aren’t people I’d recommend, but they’ve been decent to Liam. Maybe Hunter will be safe with them.

Damn it. I need to let go of my bitterness. They’re not part of my life anymore.

“You’re right. Isabella had no right to keep him from them.”

He opens his mouth to reply, but the doorbell cuts him off. Liam’s footsteps race toward the foyer. Please, don’t let it be Ethan. The last thing I need is another brawl between him and Lucas this early.

I slip out to check.

“Who was it?” I ask Liam.

He shrugs. “No one. Just this.”

He hands me a note with my name scrawled across the front. A chill slithers down my spine.

“Go back inside. I’ll be right there.”

He obeys, leaving me alone. The air feels thick, charged with danger. I unfold the note.

YOU WILL PAY FOR EVERYTHING.

My pulse skyrockets. I scan the street—nothing. No one.

Tucking the note into my pocket, I force calm into my steps as I return to the kitchen.

“What was it?” Lucas frowns. “You look spooked.”

“Nothing. Just a prank, probably.” I shrug, though my heart hammers against my ribs.

“Kids these days,” he mutters.

Breakfast passes with laughter—Hunter and Liam trading school stories, Lucas sharing work antics. But beneath my smiles, the note burns in my mind.

Something tells me this isn’t a joke. My instincts scream that someone’s coming for me.

Again, my life might be in danger.
###Chapter 106

The moment Sophia stepped into the dimly lit hospital corridor, her pulse quickened.

The sterile scent of antiseptic filled her nostrils, triggering memories she’d rather forget.

Liam clung to her hand, his small fingers trembling slightly. "Mom, is Dad going to be okay?"

She forced a reassuring smile. "He’s strong, sweetheart. He’ll pull through."

But the truth gnawed at her.

Ethan Blackwood wasn’t just injured—he’d been targeted.

The nurse, Charlotte, approached with a clipboard. "Mrs. Blackwood? He’s stable, but still unconscious."

Sophia exhaled shakily. "Can we see him?"

Charlotte hesitated. "Just for a few minutes."

The ICU room was eerily silent, save for the rhythmic beeping of monitors.

Ethan lay motionless, his face pale against the stark white sheets. Bandages wrapped around his torso, a stark reminder of the violence that had found him.

Liam’s breath hitched. "Dad…"

Sophia squeezed his shoulder. "Talk to him. He can hear you."

As Liam whispered to his father, Sophia’s mind raced.

Who had done this?

And why now?

Her phone buzzed—a message from Daniel Carter.

"We need to talk. It’s urgent."

Her stomach twisted.

Daniel never reached out unless it was life or death.

She glanced back at Ethan, then at Liam.

Whatever was coming, she wouldn’t let it tear them apart again.

Not when they’d just found their way back to each other.

But the shadows lurking at the edges of her vision whispered otherwise.

Danger was closer than she thought.

And this time, it wouldn’t stop until it had taken everything from her.

Sunlight streams through my bedroom curtains, forcing my eyelids open. I linger beneath the covers, one hand resting on my rounded belly where tiny kicks greet my palm.

The calendar on my nightstand confirms it - six months pregnant today. A shiver runs down my spine at the thought. Pregnancy is terrifying. Every milestone feels like walking through a minefield blindfolded. I whisper a prayer of gratitude, painfully aware many mothers never get to hold their babies.

After my morning ritual, hunger drives me downstairs before even showering. Yesterday's chaos made me forget to eat entirely.

Memories of Ethan's lips on mine surface unbidden. My traitorous body still thrums with the memory. I wanted more - his hands, his touch, everything. Hormones? Please. I'm not that good at lying to myself.

Self-loathing curdles in my stomach. After everything Ethan put me through, how could I respond like that? I swore I'd moved on, yet there I was, making out with my ex like some desperate fool.

Maybe Ethan has changed. Maybe pigs can fly. Even if he has, the damage is done. Some wounds never truly heal.

I slam frying pans onto the stove with more force than necessary. Why can't I stop thinking about that damn kiss? His taste, his scent - it's maddening.

"Something bothering you?" Lucas's sudden voice makes me drop the eggs I'm holding.

"Jesus, Callum!" I press a hand to my racing heart. "You nearly gave me a heart attack."

He chuckles. "Sorry. Thought you heard us come in. Hunter and Liam weren't exactly quiet."

I turn to see the boys already devouring yesterday's cookies.

"Just lost in thought," I murmur.

His smile fades. "Still upset about Isabella yesterday?"

I nod, letting him assume that's what's troubling me. Better than admitting I'm obsessing over Ethan's kiss.

"What's for breakfast, Mom?" Liam asks through a mouthful of cookie.

"Full English," I answer.

"Yes!" Hunter punches the air. "Best breakfast ever!"

His joy warms my heart. I pray Isabella comes to her senses before she loses her son forever.

"Almost done?" Liam whines. "I'm starving."

"Five more minutes. Go wait in the living room."

They scamper off while Callum takes the cleaning supplies from me. "Sorry to barge in. The boys insisted on your cooking."

I laugh. Callum's not a bad cook - just different, according to the kids.

"Was going to bring some over anyway," I say, cracking fresh eggs into the pan.

"How are you holding up?" I ask gently.

"Relieved," he admits. "Hunter shouldn't be a secret. After my grandfather died, it was just us two. He deserves to know his family."

Personally, I think Tristan and Victoria aren't worth knowing, but they've been decent to Liam. Maybe I should let go of my grudges. They're not part of my life anymore.

"You're right. Isabella had no right to keep Hunter from them."

The doorbell cuts off his reply. As Liam's footsteps pound toward the door, I pray it's not Ethan. The last thing I need is another morning brawl.

"Who was it?" I call when Liam returns.

He shrugs. "No one there. Just this."

The note in his hand bears my name in jagged letters. Ice floods my veins at the sight.

"Go back inside," I tell him, forcing calm into my voice.

Alone on the porch, the hair on my neck stands up. I unfold the note with trembling fingers.

YOU WILL PAY FOR EVERYTHING.

My breath catches. I scan the empty street before stuffing the note in my pocket.

"Everything okay?" Callum asks when I return. "You look pale."

"Just kids playing pranks," I lie, my pulse hammering.

Breakfast passes with forced cheer. The boys share school stories while Callum talks about work. But the note burns in my mind.

My instincts scream this isn't a prank. Someone's coming for me.

Danger looms on the horizon again.

###Chapter 107

It's been two days since the truth came out, and I still can't stop thinking about that kiss.

When I leaned in to kiss Sophia, I fully expected her to shove me away. Or worse—slap me. The shock of her letting me kiss her was overwhelming. That shock quickly melted into pure, unadulterated happiness.

I can't believe I spent years denying myself the taste of her lips. They were soft, intoxicating, like a drug I couldn't get enough of. I could spend eternity kissing her and still crave more.

God, I was such a fool. Every time I rejected her during our marriage, I thought I was punishing her. I never realized I was punishing myself. I missed out on so much, and the regret eats at me.

Right now, I'm in my office, but my mind is anywhere but work. I have meetings lined up for the next few days, yet all I can replay in my head is that kiss.

I feel like a damn teenager again. The way she kissed me back—it was like the first time all over again. The rush, the thrill, the way my heart pounded like I'd conquered the world.

"What's got you grinning like an idiot?" Sebastian's voice cuts through my thoughts.

I glance up as he drops into the chair across from my desk.

"Nothing," I mutter, clearing my throat.

"That's definitely something. Let me guess—Sophia?"

I don't answer, but he already knows he's right.

"So? What happened?" he presses, curiosity lighting his eyes.

I debate keeping it to myself, but he's my twin. What's the point in hiding it?

"I kissed her. And she let me," I say, unable to keep the pride out of my voice.

It felt like a goddamn miracle. For those few seconds, she was mine again.

Sebastian grins. "That's progress."

"It was—until she remembered something I said and pushed me away."

The thing about hurting someone is that when you try to fix it, you're fighting against their pain. Their scars. Their memories.

That's what happened with Sophia. My own cruel words came back to haunt us. The pain I caused her resurfaced, reminding her I was the enemy. The one who broke her.

And like any sane person, she told me to leave.

"What did you say to her?"

I don't want to repeat it, but I do. I tell him everything—how Isabella lied, how I stormed to Sophia's house and spat those vile words at her.

When I finish, Sebastian stares at me, expression unreadable.

"You're a selfish, stupid asshole," he says bluntly.

I drag a hand down my face. "Tell me something I don't know."

"I won't bother listing how wrong you were. The fact that you're tearing yourself up says enough."

I don't know how she ever tolerated me. Just thinking about what I put her through makes me sick. It only makes me admire her more—most women wouldn't have lasted a year with me, let alone as long as she did.

"On the bright side, she was receptive. That's gotta mean something, right?" he says after a pause.

I'm about to agree when a terrifying thought hits me.

"What if it's just the hormones?" I rake a hand through my hair. "Pregnancy hormones can mess with libido. What if that's all it was?"

The hope inside me withers. Will I ever get a real chance to fix this? Can I even win her back?

Sebastian shakes his head. "Doubt it. We both know Sophia. If she didn't want it, she wouldn't have let you. Hormones or not."

Before I can respond, the door swings open. Nathan walks in, looking like hell. He collapses into the chair beside Sebastian.

"You look like shit," Sebastian informs him.

Nathan exhales heavily. "Feel like it too."

Ever since we found out Isabella had been hiding a child for eight years, everything's been a mess.

"How are things?" I ask.

"Bad. I can't even look at Isabella right now. Mom gave her an ultimatum—either she builds a relationship with Oliver, or she's cut off."

Sebastian and I exchange stunned glances. I never thought Victoria would threaten to disown her own daughter.

Even when Sophia and I messed up, she never went that far. She and William gave her the cold shoulder, but they never cut ties.

"Seriously?" Sebastian asks.

"Dead serious," Nathan mutters. He rubs his temples. "Anyway, I don't want to talk about it. What were you two discussing before I walked in?"

"Sophia," Sebastian answers.

Nathan's expression darkens, the way it always does when her name comes up. He still carries guilt over how he spoke to her that day.

"Sebastian thinks Ethan might actually have a shot with her," Sebastian says.

Nathan blinks, confused. Then it hits me—he has no idea about my feelings for her.

"Wait—you're pursuing her?" He looks like he's piecing together a puzzle.

"Yeah," I growl. "Got a problem with that?"

Nathan sighs. "No. I'm guessing you have feelings for her?" He shrugs. "Good. She deserves happiness. And we all know you were always her dream."

Sebastian raises a brow. "You're not mad at him?"

I hold my breath. Not that it matters. Even if he were furious, it wouldn't change a damn thing. If being with Sophia costs me his friendship, so be it.

"Why would I be mad?"

"Because of Isabella. You were the one pushing them together."

"Yeah, before I realized he didn't love her anymore. When she came back, something was off. The spark was gone. It was obvious—he was fighting it, but his actions spoke louder than words." He pauses. "It's time we all let go of the past. You, Sophia, Isabella—even Lucas. You've all suffered because of a love that wasn't meant to last. My advice? Don't waste time. Life's too short."

A heavy silence falls over us. His words carry an eerie weight, sending a chill down my spine.

"Since when did you get so wise?" I force a laugh, trying to lighten the mood.

They chuckle, but it's hollow. The tension lingers.

I don't know why, but I have this gut feeling—something bad is coming.

Nathan's right. I'm not wasting another second.

I'm leaving for this trip soon, and the moment I get back, I'm telling Sophia the truth.

It's time she knows how I really feel.
###Chapter 108

That damn note won’t leave my mind. It’s all I can think about.

I wanted to believe it was just some sick joke, but the gnawing dread in my gut won’t let me dismiss it. Every time I read those words, my skin crawls.

I considered reporting it, but what’s the point? It’s just one note. Maybe Lucas was right—maybe it’s nothing.

My phone rings, startling me. I drop the mop and snatch it up. Ethan’s name flashes on the screen. For a second, I consider ignoring it, but I don’t.

"Hello," I say flatly.

"Hey. How are you?" His voice is hesitant, almost cautious.

This new version of Ethan still throws me off. It’s like he woke up one day and decided to be a different person. If this change is real, it’ll take time to adjust.

"Did you need something?"

"Yeah. I’m leaving for a business trip. Just wanted to let you know."

I blink. Since when does he inform me about his trips?

"Oh. So you want me to tell Liam?"

Liam’s at school. He hates when Ethan travels, but he’ll deal with it.

Ethan hesitates. "He already knows. I wanted you to know too."

I freeze.

Ethan never told me about his trips before. He’d vanish in the morning, and I’d only find out through Liam. It was deliberate. He knew it hurt me. That’s why he kept doing it.

"I don’t see why that’s my business, Ethan. I’m not your wife. Or your keeper." I try to keep the bite out of my voice, but it’s hard.

Every nice thing he does now just reminds me of how cruel he used to be. The past isn’t something I can just erase.

"I know. But it’s basic courtesy." He speaks slowly, like I’m some unpredictable animal.

I snort. "Courtesy? You didn’t care about that when we were married."

Silence stretches between us before I sigh.

"Look, I don’t want to fight."

"Neither do I." He exhales. "My jet’s ready, but when I get back, we need to talk. It’s important."

My curiosity spikes. "Can’t you tell me now?"

"No. It’s something I need to say in person."

I hate waiting. Now I’ll spend days overanalyzing, imagining worst-case scenarios.

"Just tell me. I hate suspense."

"It’ll have to wait." Background noise filters through—voices, movement. "I have to go. Take care. We’ll talk when I’m back."

The line goes dead before I can protest.

Damn it. What the hell does he want to talk about?

"Sophia!" A shout snaps me out of my thoughts.

Great. Now I’ll be stuck in this weird limbo until Ethan returns.

"In the kitchen!" I call back.

Footsteps approach. Lucas walks in, looking… off. His eyes are wide, like he’s just uncovered some huge secret. He’s in sweats—his day off, I remember.

"What’s wrong? You’re yelling like the world’s ending," I say when he doesn’t speak.

He shakes his head. "Sorry. I, uh… wanted to ask you something."

First Ethan, now Lucas. The way he’s fidgeting tells me I won’t like this.

"Okay. Shoot."

He takes a deep breath.

"I want to take you on a date."

I stare. Did I hear that right?

"What?"

"A date," he repeats, firmer this time. "I know it’s probably too soon, but… we could help each other move on. We understand what the other’s been through."

My brain short-circuits.

He’s suggesting we be each other’s rebound. That never ends well.

"Lucas…" I scramble for the right words. "You’re an amazing man. Any woman would be lucky to have you. But this isn’t a good idea."

He tenses. "But?"

"We’re both fresh out of messy situations. The last time I jumped into something post-divorce, I ended up pregnant by a man who tried to kill me. And you—you’re still in love with Isabella. I won’t make that mistake again."

His shoulders slump. "You’re right. I’m sorry."

He turns and walks out the back door before I can say more.

"Lucas!" I call, but he’s already crossing the yard to his house.

I sigh and head back inside—just as the doorbell rings.

Deja vu hits hard.

I open the door. No one’s there. Just another note.

This one’s smeared with what looks like blood. The message is clear:

TIME’S RUNNING OUT, SOPHIA. HAVE YOU SAID GOODBYE TO YOUR LOVED ONES?

I drop it, my blood turning to ice.

This isn’t a prank.

Someone’s coming for me.

And I have no idea who—or why.
###Chapter 109

"What's going on, Sophia?"



We hardly ever talk. Most of our exchanges are brief—just a message here and there. Usually, it's him letting me know he's sent a package, and me thanking him for it.

I know it's risky, but right now, he's the only one I can turn to. I won’t lie—that second note terrified me.

"I need your help, Damian," I say bluntly. No point in small talk. Besides, from what I’ve gathered about him, he isn’t the type for pleasantries.

It took me a while to muster the courage to call him. I debated whether to go to the police or reach out to him. In the end, logic won. The last time I was in danger, the police couldn’t help. Damian, on the other hand, had known everything before I did.

Maybe he could help me figure out who was after me.

"Alright, what is it?" he asks, curiosity lacing his voice. Probably because I’ve never asked him for anything before.

"Someone’s targeting me."

"Oh, is this about those notes you’ve been getting?"

I’m stunned, but not entirely surprised. See? This is exactly why I thought he’d be the best person to help. He was already steps ahead.

"Yes," I reply. "Do you know who’s behind them? And how do you even know about them?"

I hold my breath, hoping he has answers. It would be even better if he was already handling the problem. After all, hadn’t he promised me his protection?

"I have my sources," he says. "I don’t know who’s behind them, but my contact says the person leaving them wears a mask and a long black coat. From what he’s gathered, he thinks it’s a woman."

I wrack my brain, trying to think of any woman who’d want to hurt me, but I come up empty. Over the past few months, I’ve angered plenty of people—Isabella being the most recent. But who would hold enough resentment to threaten me like this?

"Why didn’t your contact stop them?" I ask.



It’s a fair question. If you see a stranger leaving threatening notes, you intervene.

"He didn’t think much of it until the second note. That’s when he got suspicious."

I can’t blame him. I didn’t take the first note seriously either.

"What do the notes say?"

"Hold on. Let me send you a picture."

I snap a photo of both notes side by side and send it to him. He goes silent as he studies them.

My stomach twists at the thought of what could happen if the police ever found out about this.

Damian was still in hiding, and the authorities were still hunting him. I was taking a risk by involving him—one that could land me in prison as an accomplice.

Not that I knew where he was hiding, and we barely spoke, but I doubt that would convince a jury of my innocence.

"Looks like whoever this is has a grudge and wants to hurt you," he finally says.

"Wow, thanks for that brilliant deduction," I snap sarcastically. "I already figured that out, you know, with the whole ‘say goodbye to your loved ones’ bit."

I didn’t mean to be sharp, but fear had me on edge. Knowing someone was planning my death was terrifying. Even worse—I was pregnant. If something happened to me, my baby would be gone too. I couldn’t let that happen.

"There’s not much else I can gather," he sighs. "Who have you crossed recently? Who would want revenge? Let’s start there."

"I honestly don’t know, Damian. You seem to know everything that happens around me, so you know I’ve pissed off a lot of people lately."

"Fine. Just send me a list of names, and I’ll see what I can do. Okay?"

I nod before remembering he can’t see me. "Okay."

"Don’t worry, Sophia. We’ll find this bastard. There’s no way I’m letting them—"



I don’t move from the couch. There’s a mountain of chores waiting, but I have no energy left. Between my racing thoughts and gnawing fear, I can’t focus even if I wanted to.

I don’t know how long I sit there before I hear keys jingling, then the front door opening. Footsteps approach, and I turn to see my parents walking in, hand in hand.

I smile. Those two were so in love, they were practically inseparable. It was adorable.

"Hey," I greet them, sitting up.

Mom takes the seat beside me while Dad sits across from us.

"Hey, sweetheart," Dad says.

"Hello, my love," Mom adds.

I’ll never get used to the way they look at me—like I’m their whole world. With them, I never had to guess. Their love was written all over their faces.

"To what do I owe this visit?" I ask. "Not that I don’t love having you here."

They exchange a glance before Mom turns to me fully.

"Well, there are a few things we wanted to discuss," she says.

I nod.

"First, I want to thank you, darling," she begins, her eyes glistening. "Daniel called us yesterday. I know he’s done terrible things, but you can’t imagine how good it felt to hear his voice. He told us you encouraged him to reach out. After thinking it over, he realized he couldn’t live without family—and we are his family."

I smile. Daniel and I mostly communicate through letters. He rarely calls. I haven’t visited him since that first time, but I know that’ll change once the baby arrives. He or she deserves to know their father.

"It’s nothing, Mom."

"No, it’s everything," she insists. "Thank you. I’ve missed my son so much."

I cringe. It’s still weird hearing her call him that, considering our past. I doubt I’ll ever get used to it.



I hug her and kiss her cheek. "Anything for you guys."

We hold each other for a moment before pulling away. Dad waits until Mom dries her tears.

"What else did you want to talk about?"

He clears his throat. "Right. We want to formally introduce you to society as our daughter and heir."

I knew this was coming, but my jaw still drops.

"Are you sure?" I stammer.

I’d been putting this off for ages. They’d wanted to announce our relationship for so long, but I’d hesitated. Not because I was ashamed—I just didn’t want the scrutiny that came with being their daughter.

"Yes. It’s time," Mom says firmly. "I want the world to know you’re our child. Finding you was a blessing, and I want to share that with everyone."

I think it over. What was the point in resisting? Rumors were already swirling, especially since Liam and I had been seen with them countless times.

"Alright," I finally agree.

Mom squeals and practically tackles me in a hug. "Thank you! I’ll start planning immediately. Maybe we’ll go old-school and throw a ball in your honor."

I smile as she excitedly shares her ideas with Dad and me.

I want to feel happy. Excited. But I can’t.

Not when I still don’t know who’s threatening me.
###Chapter 110

The note had consumed my thoughts for days. I needed to uncover who was behind it—only then could I finally breathe easy again.

This constant fear was suffocating. Even Liam had noticed my jumpiness. Every time he asked, I lied through my teeth, claiming I was fine when I was anything but.

Life had been simpler married to Ethan. Back then, my biggest worries were whether he’d come home for dinner or if he’d ever love me. The heartache had been brutal, but at least it wasn’t life-threatening.

Since the divorce? Chaos. Three attempts on my life—my car exploded, my house burned down, and I’d been kidnapped twice. After letting Damian Slade into my world, I’d hoped for peace. Instead, another shadow loomed over me.

"Mom, can I go to Hunter’s?" Liam’s voice startled me so badly I nearly dropped my coffee.

I forced a steadying breath. See? This is what I mean.

He gave me a weird look, but I ignored it, plastering on a smile. "Sure. Use the back door, okay?"

I stood, following him to ensure he crossed safely to Lucas Montgomery’s house.

"Hunter thinks he’ll beat me at games today. Last time, I crushed him," Liam said, grinning.

"That’s great, sweetheart."

I hadn’t seen Lucas since that awkward kitchen encounter. Was he avoiding me out of embarrassment or hurt? Either way, I’d given him space. The last thing I needed was more tension.

"Bye, Mom!" Liam called as he dashed inside.

Once he was safe, I turned back—just as a knock echoed through the house. My pulse spiked. Please, not another note.

I opened the door to Ethan Blackwood. Shit. I’d forgotten we were supposed to talk. With everything happening, our "chat" had slipped my mind.

"Hey," he murmured, hands shoved in his pockets.

Nervous? That was new.

"Come in," I said, scanning the street. The last thing I needed was a stalker delivering a threat while he was here.

His brow arched. "What?"

"I thought you’d fight me on this."

"Do you want to come in or not?" I snapped.

He stepped inside, and I shut the door fast, paranoia prickling my skin. These days, every shadow felt like a threat.

I sank into my recliner—a recent purchase to ease my aching back. Even my mattress had been replaced.

"So, what’s this about?" I met his gaze. "You made it sound urgent. Is it Liam?"

He exhaled sharply. "No. It’s about us."

I stared. Had he lost his mind? "There is no 'us,' Ethan. You keep forgetting that."

I didn’t have the energy for this. Not now.

"Just listen," he pleaded, voice raw.

Something in his tone made me pause. I bit back my retort and waited.

He struggled for words, the silence stretching. Then—

"I love you."

My jaw dropped. I gaped at him, then reached out to feel his forehead. "Are you high? Sick? Or did I hallucinate?"

He glared but softened instantly, catching my hand and pressing a kiss to my palm. "I don’t know when or how it happened, Sophia. But I love you. I was too blinded by anger to see what I had. These months without you? Hell. Seeing you hurt destroys me. I’m begging you—give me a chance to love you the way you deserved all along."

He dropped to his knees.

This had to be a dream.

"Ethan," I whispered, scrambling for coherence. "You don’t love me. Isabella has your heart. Remember?"

Pain flashed in his eyes. I almost pitied him—maybe he was just confused.

"You’re not listening," he growled, frustration replacing the hurt.

"I am. But how can you love me now? For nine years, you hated me. You broke me, over and over, for 'ruining' your life with Isabella. Now, suddenly, you expect me to believe that’s changed?"

The old ache threatened to resurface, but I shoved it down. No more heartbreak. Not today.

"I regret everything," he whispered hoarsely. "Give me one chance. I’ll spend my life making it up to you."

"Words aren’t enough. You had nine years, Ethan. Nine years of cruelty. Why should I believe you now?"

His shoulders slumped. If my ankles weren’t killing me, I’d be pacing.

Then his gaze hardened with resolve. He cupped my face. "I know you don’t believe me. But I won’t give up. I’ll prove this is real, Sophia—even if it takes forever."

He kissed me, quick and fierce, then left before I could react.

I sat frozen.

He loves me?

Was it true? Or was this another path to devastation?

One thing was certain—whether I believed him or not, the choice might not be mine to make much longer.
###Chapter 111

I stared at the note, my fingers trembling. My heart pounded so violently I feared it might crack my ribs. Fear coiled in my stomach like a venomous snake. This was the third threat.

I had just returned from dropping Liam at school when I spotted the small box on my doorstep, wrapped in a crimson bow. For a fleeting moment, I thought it was a gift—until I lifted the lid and found the dead rat inside, the note resting beside it like a cruel joke.

Panic clawed at my throat. The threats were escalating.

I dumped the box and its grotesque contents into the trash before snatching my phone and dialing Damian. I prayed he had answers. That somehow, against all odds, he’d uncovered who was behind this.

He answered on the second ring, his voice rough, like gravel. "Sophia."

"Please tell me you have something," I begged, my voice cracking.

I knew I sounded rude, but terror had stripped me of pleasantries. Every stranger on the street, every accidental brush of shoulders in a store—my mind twisted them into potential threats.

I hadn’t told my family. Didn’t want to drag them into this nightmare. But if this continued, I’d have no choice. The police, my friends—anyone who could help.

"Sorry, Sophia. Nothing solid. Every lead’s gone cold," he admitted, regret heavy in his tone.

I wanted to scream. To curse the universe. But rage wouldn’t solve this. I needed answers. Because deep down, I knew—something terrible was coming.

"How is that possible?" My voice shook. "This time, it was a dead rat, Damian. I’m terrified. Fucking terrified."

Tears spilled over despite my efforts to hold them back, soaking the collar of my blouse.

"I’m doing everything I can," he said softly.

Something about his words snapped the last thread of my composure. Anger surged, white-hot and blinding.

"Then do more!" I shrieked, the sound bouncing off the walls.

"Sophia." His voice was sharp, and I froze, deflating instantly.

"I’m sorry," I whispered, shame flooding me. "I didn’t mean to—I’m just… losing it."

He exhaled. "I get it. But listen to me—nothing’s going to happen to you. I won’t let it."

I didn’t respond. How could I, when every instinct screamed that disaster was coming?

"Let me make some calls. I’ll update you," he added when my silence stretched.

"Okay."

I hung up without another word.

Slumping onto a kitchen stool, I glared at the trash bin. My thoughts spiraled—endless, suffocating. Sleep had become a stranger. When I did drift off, nightmares swallowed me whole—visions of Liam and me, lifeless.

Between the threats and Ethan’s sudden confession of love days ago, my mind was a battlefield.

Restless, I jumped up and paced. I needed a distraction before I shattered completely.

After minutes of frantic steps, I called Amelia. No answer. I tried again—same result. Maybe she was busy.

Next, Natalie. She picked up on the third ring.

"Hey, love. You okay?" Her voice was distracted.

"Fine. Want to go shopping?" I asked, desperate. I didn’t need anything, but I needed out of my head.

"Sorry, hun. Swamped today. Thursday? I’ll clear my schedule."

Disappointment bit, but I understood. "No worries. Thursday’s perfect."

After we hung up, I scanned the kitchen. Staying here until Liam returned was unbearable.

Grabbing my purse and keys, I fled. Ice cream. That would help.

The drive passed in a blur.

I parked across from the shop and ordered a massive sundae. If my brain wouldn’t shut up, I’d numb it with sugar and cold.

For two blissful hours, I lost myself in blueberry swirl and vanilla, flipping through a borrowed book. The calm was fleeting but precious.

As I paid, unease prickled my skin. A warning. Stay inside.

I ignored it.

Big mistake.

The screech of tires. Gunshots.

Screams. Pain.

Then—nothing.
###Chapter 112

"Sir? Would you like me to bring you anything from the café?" My assistant's voice pulls me from my thoughts, but my gaze remains fixed on the cityscape beyond my office window.

The view had always been breathtaking—one of the main reasons I'd chosen this space. But today, it offered no solace.

"No. Not today," I reply without turning.

"Understood. I'll return in half an hour."

I don’t acknowledge her, and seconds later, the door clicks shut. A frustrated sigh escapes me. An unshakable sense of dread has clung to me all morning, heavier than ever.

My pulse won’t settle. My mind won’t focus. It’s as if my instincts are screaming at me, but I can’t decipher the warning.

To distract myself, I think of Sophia—our conversation, her hesitation. I understand it. God, do I ever. For over a decade, I drilled into her that Isabella was the only woman I’d ever love.

I made sure she knew how little she meant to me. Nine years of punishment for something beyond her control. I convinced her—and myself—that I despised her with every fiber of my being.

So how could I possibly expect her to believe me now?

It’s infuriating, but fair. If our roles were reversed, I wouldn’t trust me either.

And the damage I’ve done? Nine years of cruelty doesn’t vanish overnight. It might take years to undo the wounds I’ve inflicted. Some scars may never fade.

I want her. Desperately. But if she walks away, I’ll accept it. That’s the penance I deserve.

I try to focus on her face, on strategies to win her back—but this gnawing dread won’t relent. It’s suffocating. I pace like a caged animal, my hands raking through my hair.

I turn on the TV, needing noise to drown out the chaos in my head.

I don’t know how long I’ve been pacing when the door bursts open. Sebastian stands there, his usual composure shattered. His breaths are ragged, his eyes bloodshot.

I freeze.

Sebastian never looks like this. If he’s unraveled, something is catastrophically wrong.

"What happened?" My voice is sharp, my pulse spiking. Our parents? Liam?

"Ethan—" His voice cracks.

"Damn it, Sebastian! Tell me!"

He swallows hard, his gaze locking onto mine.

"It’s Sophia."

Before I can demand details, a news anchor’s voice cuts through the room, her name flashing on the screen.

BREAKING NEWS.

The bold headline sears into my vision.

"Prominent Sterling family member and founder of The Hope Foundation was ambushed in a targeted shooting earlier today. The gunman remains at large. Viewer discretion advised."

My knees buckle.

The footage shows Sophia leaving an ice cream parlor, lost in thought. A black SUV screeches into frame. A masked figure leans out—gun raised—and fires.

Bang. Bang. Bang.

She collapses. Blood pools around her.

The reporter’s voice drones on, but I don’t hear it. All I see is Sophia’s lifeless body.

"Ethan!" Sebastian grips my shoulder. "Don’t watch—"

I shove past him.

"I need to get to her. Now."

I sprint down the hallway, ignoring the stunned stares of my staff. The elevator doors close too slowly. My hands shake so violently I drop my keys twice.

"Goddamn it!" I kick the tire of my car, raw terror clawing at my chest.

Sebastian snatches the keys from my grip. "You’re in no state to drive."

I don’t argue. He’s right.

As we speed toward the hospital, one prayer loops in my mind:

Don’t take her from me. Not now. Not like this.
###Chapter 113

Fuck. Why did this have to happen to her? Who would dare do this to Sophia? Were there signs I missed? Was she in danger, and I was too blind to see it?

The questions pounded in my skull as Sebastian sped out of the underground parking. If she was hurt because I failed to protect her, I’d never forgive myself.

"Is she alive?" The words clawed their way out of my throat, thick with fear.

She had to be. She just fucking had to.

Sebastian shot me a sideways glance. "She's alive."

Barely.

He didn’t say it, but I heard it anyway.

I’d seen the footage. Whoever did this wanted her dead. Wanted to make sure she didn’t walk away. Two bullets had hit her—maybe more. I didn’t know how bad it was, but I knew it was bad.

"Which hospital?" My voice was rough, barely recognizable.

I hadn’t even asked. All I could think about was getting to her.

"Avenue Hospital," Sebastian said. "I called around. They took her there."

At least it was the best in the city.

I tried to steady my breathing, to push back the panic threatening to drown me. But it was impossible. I wouldn’t breathe right again until I knew she was okay.

"She’ll pull through, Ethan," Sebastian said after a long silence.

I wanted to believe him. But I couldn’t. She might survive—but the baby? The fall alone could’ve been enough. If she lived but lost the child, it would destroy her. I knew Sophia. The grief would shatter her.

"Drive faster," I snapped.

Every second felt like an eternity. Why did time crawl when you needed it to fly?

"I’m going as fast as I can."

"It’s not fast enough. I need to be there."

What if she woke up alone? What if she needed me?

I should’ve trusted my gut. That gnawing dread I’d ignored—I should’ve acted. Should’ve made sure she was safe. Now she was paying for my mistake.

"Any idea who did this?" Sebastian asked.

He was trying to distract me. But there was no distraction from this.

"Damien Slade," I growled. "He’s the only one with a motive."

If it was him, he’d won. He’d gotten his revenge. Nothing else could hurt like this.

"What about Liam? You have to tell him," Sebastian said.

Fuck. I’d forgotten. He adored his mother. This would break him.

"How?" My voice cracked. "How do I tell him his mother was shot? That I failed to protect her?"

The weight of it crushed me. But I couldn’t fall apart. Not now. Liam needed me. Sophia needed me.

"It wasn’t your fault," Sebastian said.

I wanted to believe that. But the guilt was a fucking avalanche.

I stayed silent. There was nothing left to say.

Minutes later, we reached the hospital. I didn’t wait for Sebastian to park. I threw the door open and ran inside.

"Sophia Sterling!" I barked at the nurse’s station.

One of them nodded. "She’s in the ER. Follow me."

"How is she? The baby?"

"I’m sorry, Mr. Blackwood. The doctors are with her now. You’ll need to wait."

I bit back a snarl. Yelling wouldn’t help.

She led me to a waiting room filled with faces I barely registered. My mother, my father, Natalie, Isabella, Nathan, Victoria—everyone was here. Except Liam.

"Ethan." My mother’s voice was soft as she wrapped her arms around me.

I didn’t trust myself to speak.

"She’ll be okay," she whispered. "Have faith."

Faith? Right now, all I had was rage and fear.

"Any updates?" Scarlett asked.

I shook my head. "Have you told her parents?"

"They’re on their way back from their trip," Nathan said. "Four hours, at least."

Liam. He couldn’t hear this from someone else.

"Sebastian," I said hoarsely. "Get that video taken down."

"Already on it." He stepped away, phone in hand.

"I need someone to get Liam," I muttered, staring at the ER doors.

Natalie nodded. "Lucas is bringing him."

Isabella stiffened at the name, but I didn’t care. Her issues with him didn’t matter right now.

The ER doors burst open. A doctor stepped out, his face grim.

"Family of Sophia Sterling?"

"Yes," I said. "How is she?"

"Her injuries are severe. The main concerns are the baby and the bullet lodged in her skull."

Gasps filled the room. I barely heard them.

"She’s unconscious. We need permission for an emergency C-section."

"But she’s only six months along!" Natalie cried.

"The amniotic sac ruptured. If we don’t act, we’ll lose the baby."

My lungs locked. This was worse than I’d imagined.

"Do it," I said.

The second the words left my mouth, an alarm blared. The lights flashed red.

Code fucking red.

A nurse rushed out, whispering frantically to the doctor. His face paled before he turned to us.

"Sophia’s heart stopped. We’re doing everything we can, but… we may need to make a choice."

The nurse stepped forward. "Given her injuries, we might not be able to save both. If it comes to it—who do we save? The mother or the baby?"

The question hit like a bullet.

How the hell was I supposed to choose?
###Chapter 114

I stare at Dr. Bennett like I’ve lost all ability to comprehend human speech. Maybe I have. His words aren’t sinking in. He’s asking me to choose between Sophia and her baby. Does he have any idea how impossible that is?

"Mr. Blackwood, we don’t have time," he urges, voice tight. "We need your decision now."

My mouth opens, but nothing comes out. I try again—same damn result.

"Mr. Blackwood?" The nurse’s voice is soft, hesitant.

"Save the baby," Amelia says suddenly, cutting through the silence. "If it comes to that… save the baby."

The doctor and nurse exchange a glance before rushing back through the ER doors. I turn to Amelia, something dark and unreadable churning inside me.

She meets my gaze, jaw set. "Don’t look at me like that, Ethan. This is what Sophia would want."

Natalie steps forward, arms crossed like she’s bracing for a fight. "She’s right. Sophia would choose her child over herself every single time. If we didn’t, she’d never forgive us."

Her words hit me like a punch to the gut. Because she’s right. But that doesn’t make the weight in my chest any lighter.

I would never wish harm on her baby. All I’m praying for now is that it doesn’t come to a choice at all. That they both make it. Sophia deserves happiness. That baby deserves life.

I drop back into the chair, hands clenched. Waiting is torture. But what else can I do? I’m not a damn surgeon. I can’t fix this. All I have left is prayer.

I don’t even remember the last time I prayed. Probably as a kid, in some half-forgotten church pew. Right now, I’d beg any god listening. I’d trade places with her in a heartbeat, even if it meant I wouldn’t walk out of here.

Just let her live. Let her glare at me, yell at me—anything. I’d give up everything to undo what happened.

"It’s my fault."

Amelia’s voice is raw. She’s crying silently, tears streaking down her face.

"She called me. I missed it. I told myself I’d call back after work. If I’d just answered—"

Nathan pulls her into his arms, murmuring something low.

"It’s not your fault," he says. "You couldn’t have known."

Natalie wraps her arms around herself, shaking. "If anyone’s to blame, it’s me. She wanted to go shopping. I said I was busy. If I’d been there—maybe I could’ve stopped it."

Victoria steps forward, voice trembling. "None of you could’ve predicted this. The only one responsible is the bastard who hurt her."

My mother nods. "Blaming yourselves won’t help. Focus on Sophia and the baby. Pray for them."

I don’t speak. My eyes stay locked on the ER doors.

This is hell. The waiting. The not knowing. I just need someone to tell me she’s okay. That they’re both safe. That this isn’t the end.

Every part of me is screaming for a miracle. Begging death to stay the hell away. It’s not their time. Not yet.

"Remember when she walked straight into that glass door at the mall?" Amelia says suddenly, a weak laugh in her voice.

Natalie snorts. "Face first, then flat on her ass."

"She was so embarrassed, but she couldn’t stop laughing."

A few people chuckle. It grates on me. My teeth clench.

"Or that time the waiter overheard her calling him hot," Natalie adds, smiling. "We were trying to signal her, but she didn’t get it until he cleared his throat."

Amelia wipes her eyes. "She made us leave. Couldn’t even look at him."

Silence falls. Everyone’s lost in memories. Most of them don’t have good ones—they treated Sophia like garbage. But Amelia and Natalie do.

"We have so many stories to tell Liam and the baby," Amelia murmurs. "So much to show them about how incredible their mother is."

Something in me snaps.

"Stop." My voice is low, dangerous.

Amelia blinks. "What?"

"Stop talking about her like she’s already gone!" I roar. "She’s not dead. She’s fighting. She’s coming back."

They’re speaking in past tense. Like they’ve already accepted she won’t make it. And I can’t fucking stand it.

Before Amelia can respond, the ER doors swing open. A different doctor steps out.

Victoria jumps up. "How is she?"

"We’re prepping her for surgery to remove the bullets. The C-section went smoothly for the baby."

Relief floods the room. But I don’t miss the way he phrased it. For the baby. What about Sophia?

Before I can ask, he smiles.

"Congratulations. It’s a girl."
###Chapter 115

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow over the bedroom. Sophia stretched lazily, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her.

Ethan had already left.

Again.

She sighed, pushing back the covers. The scent of his cologne lingered on the pillow, a cruel reminder of his absence.

Downstairs, Liam was already at the table, shoveling cereal into his mouth with the enthusiasm of a starving puppy.

"Morning, Mom," he mumbled through a mouthful.

"Morning, sweetheart." She ruffled his hair before pouring herself a cup of coffee.

The silence stretched between them, thick and uncomfortable.

Liam glanced up. "Dad left early again?"

Sophia forced a smile. "Work stuff."

Liam frowned but didn’t press further.

Her phone buzzed—a message from Daniel.

"Meet me at the café. We need to talk."

Her stomach twisted.

She hadn’t told Ethan about Daniel. Not yet. Maybe not ever.

But the guilt was eating her alive.

Liam’s voice snapped her back to reality. "Mom? You okay?"

She blinked. "Yeah. Just… thinking."

He gave her a skeptical look but went back to his cereal.

Sophia exhaled sharply.

She needed to make a decision.

And soon.

The café was nearly empty when she arrived.

Daniel sat in the corner, his dark eyes scanning the room until they landed on her.

Her pulse quickened.

"Sophia." He stood as she approached, his voice low and rough.

She slid into the seat across from him. "What’s going on?"

Daniel hesitated, then leaned forward. "I got a lead on who’s been threatening you."

Her breath hitched. "Who?"

His jaw tightened. "Someone close to Ethan."

Sophia’s blood ran cold.

Before she could respond, her phone rang.

Ethan’s name flashed on the screen.

Her fingers trembled as she answered.

"Sophia." His voice was ice. "We need to talk. Now."

The line went dead.

Daniel’s gaze darkened. "Trouble?"

She swallowed hard.

The storm was coming.

And she was right in the middle of it.

The words echo in my mind, refusing to fade.

A baby girl.

Sophia has a baby girl. A tiny daughter. Liam is going to lose his mind with joy. He’s been begging for a sister, and now, his wish has come true.

"Can I see her?"

"I understand your eagerness, Mr. Blackwood, but we need to complete her initial assessments first," the doctor says.

For a second, his words don’t register. Then it hits me—he thinks I’m the father. The realization stuns me, but I don’t correct him.

"She’s premature at twenty-six weeks, and given the trauma from the gunshot and fall, she’ll need to stay in the NICU. We’ll monitor her closely before she can be with family."

My stomach twists. He hasn’t mentioned Sophia. Does that mean they don’t expect her to make it?

My pulse spikes. She has to survive. The alternative is unthinkable.

"You should prepare yourself. We’ll do everything possible, but there are risks—cerebral palsy, developmental delays, vision or hearing impairments."

"But that’s just a possibility, right? Not a certainty?" My chest aches for this fragile little life.

She’s already endured more than most ever will.

"Correct. It’s a precaution—we inform parents of all potential outcomes."

I nod, swallowing hard.

"What about Sophia?" I demand before he can leave.

His expression tightens. "Her condition is critical. We’re still assessing."

The words slice through me like glass.

A nurse appears moments later. "She’s in surgery now. They took her through a different entrance—her injuries were… severe."

My knees nearly buckle.

I collapse into a chair, praying to a god I’ve long ignored. Bargaining. Threatening. Begging.

"Ethan, you should eat," Victoria murmurs.

I shake my head. Food? Impossible.

Sebastian sits beside me, our father on my other side. I’ve never felt so powerless.

Hours crawl by. Then the door bursts open—Liam sprints toward me, colliding with my chest. His familiar scent barely soothes the storm inside.

Behind him, Lucas enters with Hunter. I nod my thanks.

Isabella freezes at the sight of them, but Eleanor’s eyes flood with tears when she spots Liam.

"Dad, where’s Mom? Lucas wouldn’t tell me anything," Liam demands, fear etched on his face.

Damn, this is brutal.

"Is she having the baby? Is that why we’re here?"

I exhale shakily. "Your mom was hurt badly, buddy. The doctors are helping her."

His eyes well up. It guts me.

"The baby?" His voice cracks.

I force a smile. "You have a sister. Just like you wanted."

Wonder flashes across his face—then devastation as silent tears fall.

"Will she die like Grandpa did?" His whisper destroys me.

I yank him into my arms. "No. Your mom’s a fighter."

He clings to me, trembling.

We wait. I pace. Sit. Repeat. Liam never leaves my side.

When Eleanor and Alexander arrive, chaos follows.

"Where is she?" Eleanor’s eyes are raw.

Before I can answer, the surgeon returns. His grim expression says it all.

"Victoria, take the boys for snacks," I order.

Liam hesitates, but I reassure him with a lie.

The doctor exhales. "Mr. Blackwood—"

"Just say it," I snarl.

"She’s alive. But she’s in a coma."

The room tilts.

Alive—but gone.
###Chapter 116

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the bedroom floor. Sophia stretched lazily, savoring the rare moment of peace.

Her phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand.

She reached for it, squinting at the screen. A message from Daniel.

"We need to talk. It's urgent."

Her stomach twisted. Daniel never used the word urgent lightly.

She typed a quick reply. "On my way."

Throwing on a sweater, she hurried downstairs. Liam was already at the breakfast table, munching on toast.

"Morning, Mom," he mumbled through a mouthful.

"Morning, sweetheart." She kissed his forehead. "I have to step out for a bit. Gabriella will take you to school."

Liam frowned. "Everything okay?"

She forced a smile. "Just adult stuff. Don’t worry."

The drive to the police station was tense. Her fingers drummed against the steering wheel.

Daniel was waiting outside, his expression grim.

"What’s going on?" she asked as soon as she stepped out of the car.

He exhaled sharply. "We found something. About Ethan."

Her breath hitched. "What?"

Daniel hesitated, then handed her a file. "He’s been making moves behind the scenes. Dangerous ones."

Sophia flipped it open. Her blood ran cold.

Surveillance photos. Bank transactions. A list of names she recognized—some from Ethan’s past, others from her own.

"This can’t be real," she whispered.

Daniel’s jaw tightened. "I wish it wasn’t."

She stared at the documents, her mind racing. Ethan had been playing a long game. And she’d walked right into it.

"We need to act fast," Daniel said. "Before he does."

Sophia nodded, her resolve hardening.

The game had changed. And this time, she wouldn’t be the one left in the dark.

The wind howled outside the abandoned warehouse. Ethan Blackwood stood in the shadows, his phone pressed to his ear.

"It’s done," he said quietly.

A chuckle echoed from the other end. "Good. Let’s see how she handles this."

Ethan smirked. "She won’t see it coming."

He ended the call, slipping the phone into his pocket.

The trap was set.

And Sophia was walking straight into it.

"What do you mean she's in a coma?" Ethan's voice cracks, raw with fear.

My heart hammers violently, threatening to break free from my chest. The world narrows to the doctor's words, each one a hammer blow. Time stretches, warps. A high-pitched ringing drowns out everything else.

I stagger back, collapsing into the chair I'd just left. Sebastian and William reach for me, but I shove them away. Comfort isn't what I need. I need the doctor to say the surgery worked. That Sophia will open her eyes soon.

"Four bullets," the doctor continues, his tone clinical. "One to the head, one to the chest, one to the abdomen, and one to the thigh. We removed three. The one in her skull... it was too deep. Extracting it would have killed her."

My stomach twists. A bullet lodged in her brain. How is that fair? This morning, she was fine. Alive. Smiling.

At least she's breathing, a voice whispers.

I shut it out. Breathing isn't enough. Will she wake up? That's the real question.

"We stabilized the bleeding—internal and external. Administered fluids to reduce brain swelling. She flatlined twice. After the second time, she slipped into a coma. She's in the ICU now."

If watching Sophia get shot was hell, this is worse. Knowing we almost lost her—twice—feels like being flayed alive. No one deserves this pain. Not even my worst enemy.

"Will she wake up?" My voice is hoarse. "Will she recover?"

"It's too early to say. This isn't medically induced. She could wake tomorrow, next week, next year... or never."

The possibility knocks the air from my lungs.

I force the thought away. No. She's strong. She'll wake up. In a few days, she'll be glaring at me, snapping like always.

"What about the bullet?" Eleanor asks, tears streaking her cheeks. "Will it affect her?"

I can't fathom her pain. Losing Liam? Unthinkable.

"Some patients live normally. Others face memory loss, speech issues, difficulty recognizing words or numbers. We won't know until she wakes."

If she wakes.

He doesn't say it, but it's there—in his eyes, in the silence.

Eleanor nods, fresh tears falling. Alexander pulls her close. The unshakable couple I know is gone, replaced by shattered parents.

"Visiting hours are over," the doctor says. "One visitor at a time tomorrow."

He leaves as Elizabeth returns with the boys.

Liam rushes to me while Oliver clings to Lucas.

"What did the doctor say? Is Mom okay?" Liam's eyes are wide, hopeful.

This is parenthood's cruelest test: truth or lie? Do I tell him the doctors aren't sure she'll wake? Or lie, pretend she's fine?

"They don't know yet, bud. We have to wait... and hope." Honesty wins. If I lie and the worst happens, he'll never forgive me.

He stares at the floor, silent.

After a moment, I turn to the others.

"You should all go home. Rest. Come back tomorrow."

"No," Natalie and Scarlett refuse in unison, echoed by Eleanor and Alexander.

I argue, but they won't budge. Only Elizabeth, Lucas, Victoria, and William leave—Liam can't stay, and Oliver is exhausted, worry etched on his small face.

Sebastian sits beside me. We don't speak.

Then Gregory arrives.

"Sorry I'm late. We were interviewing witnesses. How is she?"

I grit my teeth. "Coma."

His face falls. "Anything you can tell me? Threats? Suspicious activity?"

"Nothing."

He turns to Nathan. "When she called me, she sounded... off. Stressed. Not herself. I wondered if Gunner's situation triggered past trauma."

"Gunner?" Gregory frowns.

"Isabella's son. She hid him until Sophia uncovered the truth," Nathan explains.

Isabella stares at the ground.

"Why hide him?"

"She didn't want him—or us—in her life. Lucas and Oliver moved next to Sophia. She pieced it together."

Gregory's gaze sharpens. "How'd that go?"

"Badly. We gave her an ultimatum: fix this or we cut ties."

Gregory rubs his chin. I know that look. He's onto something.

"I see," he murmurs.

"See what?" Sebastian and I demand.

He meets our eyes. "I have a suspect."

Nathan stiffens. "Who?"

"Isabella."

The room erupts.

I study Gregory. From his angle, it makes sense. But is Isabella's hatred enough to order a hit?

That's the real question.
###Chapter 117

The moment Sophia stepped into the dimly lit hospital corridor, her pulse quickened.

The sterile scent of antiseptic filled her nostrils, sharp and unforgiving.

Her fingers trembled as she clutched the strap of her purse, her knuckles turning white.

She had been here before—too many times.

Each visit had carved another scar into her heart.

This time, she wasn’t sure she could survive another blow.

The sound of hurried footsteps echoed behind her.

She turned to see Ethan Blackwood striding toward her, his expression unreadable.

His dark eyes flickered with something she couldn’t decipher—anger? Fear?

She swallowed hard.

"Liam?" she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Ethan’s jaw tightened.

"He’s stable," he said tersely.

Relief washed over her, but it was short-lived.

Ethan’s next words sent a chill down her spine.

"But we need to talk."

Sophia’s stomach twisted.

She had heard those words before—right before her world shattered.

Ethan motioned toward an empty waiting room.

She followed, her legs like lead.

The door clicked shut behind them, sealing them in suffocating silence.

Ethan turned to face her, his gaze piercing.

"Someone tried to take him," he said, his voice low and dangerous.

Sophia’s breath hitched.

"What?"

Ethan’s expression darkened.

"A man was seen lurking near his school. He had a photo of Liam in his pocket."

Sophia’s blood ran cold.

Her mind raced, scrambling for answers.

Who would do this?

Why?

Ethan stepped closer, his presence overwhelming.

"This isn’t a coincidence," he said, his voice like steel.

Sophia’s heart pounded.

She knew what he was implying.

This was personal.

And if Ethan was right, the danger was far from over.

The air between them crackled with tension.

Sophia clenched her fists.

She wouldn’t lose Liam.

Not again.

Not ever.

Ethan’s phone buzzed, breaking the silence.

He glanced at the screen, his expression hardening further.

"They found him," he said.

Sophia’s pulse spiked.

"Where?"

Ethan’s eyes met hers, dark and unyielding.

"At the docks."

Sophia’s stomach dropped.

The docks.

Where it had all begun.

Where blood had been spilled.

Where secrets had been buried.

And now, it seemed, those secrets were coming back to haunt them.

Ethan’s voice was grim.

"We need to go. Now."

Sophia didn’t hesitate.

She followed him out the door, her mind racing.

One thing was certain—this wasn’t over.

And whoever was behind this would regret ever targeting her son.

"That's impossible. Isabella would never do something like this." Nathan defends his sister fiercely.

Sure, he was furious with her, but at the end of the day, she was still his little sister. He would stand by her no matter what.

"Son, in my line of work, nothing is impossible," Gregory states flatly.

He pulls out a notepad and jots something down, pausing only briefly before looking back up at us.

"But seriously, Isabella wouldn’t hurt Sophia—yes, they don’t get along, but she’d never go that far," Nathan insists, while the rest of us remain silent.

I want to believe Isabella is innocent, but I’m not so sure anymore. The woman who returned months ago isn’t the same one who left years ago.

She’s consumed by rage and resentment toward Sophia. Enough to threaten a child and fabricate vicious lies just to destroy her.

"I’m not saying she did it. I’m just stating she’s a suspect," Gregory clarifies. "Hatred and anger are powerful motives for murder, especially revenge. And let’s not forget—Sophia was shot less than three weeks after exposing Isabella’s biggest secret. The one she fought so hard to keep hidden."

The evidence points straight at Isabella. She’s the only one who’s had a recent, explosive fallout with Sophia. Given their toxic history, it’s easy to imagine her snapping and hiring a hitman.

I glance at Nathan. He looks like he’s been struck by lightning. Regret flashes in his eyes—he wishes he’d kept his mouth shut, because he might have just implicated his sister.

"What about Damien Slade?" I ask, remembering he had targeted both Sophia and Isabella.

"I considered him," Gregory admits. "But something feels off. His vendetta is against you, Ethan. Sure, he kidnapped Sophia and Isabella, but according to his men, he was just toying with you. He never intended to kill Sophia—in fact, he explicitly ordered his men not to lay a finger on her, or he’d slit their throats."

That revelation catches me off guard, though I keep my expression neutral.

"Strange," I mutter, frowning.

"Very. Even stranger? The man who shot Sophia died in prison under mysterious circumstances," Gregory adds. "Anyway, like I said—his target is you. Always has been. If he ever gets his revenge, he’ll either kill you or destroy your empire."

Sebastian and I scoff in unison. The bastard can try, but he won’t succeed. Plenty have tried—hell, even the Prescotts failed. As for killing me? We’ll see about that.

"So you really don’t think it was him?" Eleanor asks softly.

"No. Whoever shot Sophia had a personal grudge. A deep one. The way they fired—it was personal. Damien has no reason to hate Sophia like that."

He confirms what I already suspected. The shooter wanted Sophia dead. That’s why they fired multiple times—to ensure she didn’t survive.

"What about the SUV’s license plate?" Alexander looks like he’s aged a decade in the last few hours.

"Nothing. The plate was removed. All we know is it was black," Gregory sighs. "And there are thousands of black SUVs in this city."

Silence falls over us, each lost in our own thoughts. My mind is a chaotic mess, barely able to focus.

I push it all aside. Right now, Sophia’s recovery is all that matters. I’ll deal with her would-be killer later.

"Alright, I’ll head back to the station," Gregory says, breaking the silence. "For now, keep her survival quiet. The last thing we need is the shooter returning to finish the job. I’ll post two officers outside her room, just in case."

I nod, and Sebastian escorts him out.

"I’ll contact our people. You reach out to yours," Alexander says. "Let’s make sure no one finds out she’s alive until she’s out of danger."

"Agreed."

I pull out my phone and start making calls.

This is going to be one hell of a long night.

I jolt awake as someone taps my shoulder.

Damn it. I must’ve fallen asleep in an awkward position because my neck and back are screaming in protest.

Blinking, I realize it’s already morning. An older nurse stands over me, smiling warmly.

"Good morning, Mr. Blackwood. I’m Florence—I’ll be Miss Sophia’s nurse today."

I attempt a smile, though it probably looks more like a grimace.

"Call me Ethan."

Glancing at Sophia’s door, I see the two officers still stationed outside. At some point during the night, we were moved to the ICU waiting area.

"Of course. Is there anything I can get you?" she asks kindly.

"No, thank you," I say, though my stomach growls in protest. I haven’t eaten since yesterday. "When can we see Sophia and the baby?"

She checks her watch. "In about two hours, when visiting hours begin."

I thank her, and as she leaves, the others begin stirring. Confusion flickers across their faces before yesterday’s horrors come rushing back.

"What did the nurse say?" Eleanor asks.

"Just introducing herself as Sophia’s nurse," I mumble.

My thoughts are scrambled, and exhaustion weighs me down. Maybe I should’ve asked for coffee. Or food.

"Did she say when we could see them?"

Before I can answer, movement at the entrance catches my eye. Maybe it’s the lack of sleep, but it takes a second for my brain to process.

When recognition hits, my entire body tenses.

You’ve got to be kidding me.

What the hell is Damien Slade doing here?
###Chapter 118

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow over the room. Sophia stretched lazily, savoring the rare moment of peace.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand.

She reached for it, blinking at the unfamiliar number flashing on the screen. A cold knot formed in her stomach.

"Hello?" Her voice was steady, but her fingers trembled.

A deep, unfamiliar chuckle sent chills down her spine. "Miss Blackwood. Did you really think you could hide forever?"

Her breath hitched.

The line went dead.

Sophia stared at the phone, her pulse roaring in her ears. Someone knew. Someone had found her.

Downstairs, Liam’s laughter floated up from the kitchen. The sound grounded her, but only barely.

She forced herself to move, throwing on a robe before descending the stairs.

Ethan stood by the stove, flipping pancakes with an ease that contrasted sharply with the tension coiling inside her. He glanced up, his smile fading when he saw her face.

"What’s wrong?"

She hesitated.

Then the doorbell rang.

Both of them froze.

Ethan wiped his hands on a towel, his expression hardening. "Stay here."

Sophia clutched the counter, her nails digging into the marble.

The front door creaked open.

Silence.

Then—

"Mom?" Liam’s voice, confused.

Sophia’s heart stopped.

A familiar, mocking laugh echoed through the house.

"Long time no see, darling."

Her blood turned to ice.

Sebastian.

He was here.

My blood boils as fury surges through my veins. Despite Gregory's words, I still haven't crossed Damien Slade off my list of suspects.

Seriously, what kind of man kidnaps Sophia unless he has a twisted agenda? And Gregory's explanation? It makes zero sense. Why abduct her just to force my hand if he truly didn’t intend to harm her?

"What the hell are you doing here?" I snap, my voice dripping with venom.

His cold gaze sweeps over me, then the others. Everyone tenses, ready for a fight, but Damien remains unfazed.

That’s what makes him so dangerous—he’s unhinged. I may be ruthless, but Damien? He’s on another level. A sociopath wrapped in a lethal package.

"Here to see Sophia. Why else would I waste my time on you?" His smirk is pure arrogance.

I clench my jaw, forcing myself not to throw the first punch. Starting a brawl in a hospital? Fastest way to get kicked out.

"And you expect us to believe that?" Sebastian challenges. "You kidnapped her months ago."

Damien’s eyes lock onto my brother, and even I feel the chill. His gaze is empty—like a man who sold his soul long ago.

"Couldn’t care less what you think," he says smoothly. "Now, are you going to tell me how she is, or do I have to hunt down her doctor myself?"

His condescension grates on my nerves. What the hell is he even doing here?

"Why would we tell you anything?" I hiss. "For all we know, you’re the bastard who put a hit on her."

Damien stares at me, then throws his head back and laughs—a sound so cold it raises goosebumps.

He stops abruptly, his gaze sharpening.

"Trust me, if I wanted Sophia dead, she would be."

"Then why are you here?" Eleanor demands. "Her health is none of your concern."

His eyes flick past me, lingering on someone behind us. I turn slightly—Natalie.

She’s staring at him like he’s a storm she can’t look away from.

Interesting.

Damien finally drags his gaze back to Eleanor. "She’s carrying my niece. Of course I’d be concerned."

Silence.

Did he just say—?

"That’s impossible," Amelia stammers.

Eleanor and Alexander’s reactions confirm Damien isn’t their son. So if he’s telling the truth…

Then it clicks.

"You’re Daniel’s brother," I say.

"Bingo."

Eleanor’s voice is barely a whisper. "When we adopted Daniel, we were told he had no family left."

"I was in juvie at the time," Damien admits. "One of my father’s men told me Daniel was in foster care. I had his records altered so it looked like our father was his only family." He pauses. "I wanted him to have a normal life. Not end up like me."

"And yet he still went to prison," I mutter.

Damien laughs—a sound almost warm, if such a thing were possible for him.

"Sophia said the same damn thing."

The room falls silent until Alexander speaks.

"From your tone, you’ve been in contact with my daughter."

"Not in person. We’ve been… communicating."

He lays it all out—his original plan, how he later approached Sophia, asked to be part of the baby’s life. And Sophia, with her dangerously kind heart, agreed.

Natalie frowns. "You realize if the police find out you’ve been in contact with her, she’ll be in trouble?"

Damien smirks. "Don’t worry. I have a plan."

"Did she mention anything to you?" I press. "Any threats? Anything at all?"

He tells us about the notes—three in total. The last one arrived the day she was shot.

The thought of her going to him instead of me burns, but I shove it aside. Right now, none of that matters.

"I should’ve dug deeper," Damien mutters, guilt flashing in his eyes—an emotion I never thought I’d see from him.

We’re all drowning in the same regret when Isabella walks in.

Damien’s warmth vanishes.

Before anyone can react, he lunges, slamming her against the wall, his hand around her throat.

"What the hell?" Nathan shouts.

Isabella gasps, terror in her eyes.

"Let her go, Damien," I order.

He tightens his grip.

Nathan tries to pull him off, but Damien doesn’t budge.

"If I find out you had anything to do with this," he hisses, "I’ll make your favorite serial killer documentaries look like fairy tales. Understood?"

Isabella nods frantically, tears streaming.

Damien releases her with a final warning glare.

Nathan swings at him, but Damien dodges effortlessly.

"Try that again, and you’ll be buried beside your father within the week."

Nathan backs off. He knows Damien doesn’t make empty threats.

A nurse enters, cutting through the tension.

"Hello, I’m Elizabeth, the head NICU nurse—"

"Is the baby okay?" I interrupt.

She smiles gently. "She’s stable. We’re monitoring her closely, but we’re confident she’ll pull through."

Relief floods me—and, surprisingly, Damien.

"We need to name her," Elizabeth says. "Do you know what her mother chose?"

Silence.

Then a small voice speaks up.

"Lily."

I turn. Liam stands there, holding my parents’ hands.

He walks over, takes my hand, and looks at the nurse.

"She didn’t know if it was a boy or girl, but she said if it was a boy, his name would be Julian. If it was a girl… Lily Claire Howell."

Elizabeth smiles. "And her last name?"

Liam doesn’t hesitate.

"Howell. Her name is Lily Claire Howell."
###Chapter 119

I gaze at my son, overwhelmed with pride. The bond he shares with his mother is something extraordinary. Not even her closest friends or parents knew the name she had chosen, yet she confided in Liam.

"That's wonderful," Elizabeth says, smiling warmly at him. "You're going to be an amazing big brother."

Liam nods, then lifts his eyes to meet mine.

"One day, we were sitting on her bed eating ice cream—she craved it so much. I asked what name we'd give the baby. We spent hours going through lists until we settled on those two. We laughed so much."

Tears well in his eyes again, and I pull him close. It aches to see him in pain. I wish I could take it away, but I can't.

"When will she wake up? I miss her," he sobs.

I stay silent. I don’t have an answer. Not even the doctors know if—or when—Sophia will open her eyes.

Elizabeth kneels to his level, gently coaxing him. Liam clings to me but turns his head toward her.

"How about this? I’ll let you visit your sister first. You’ll be the very first to see her," she offers.

"Really?" He wipes his tears.

"Really." She smiles. "Just give me a few minutes, then I’ll come get you. Okay?"

A small smile tugs at his lips. The sadness lingers, but hope pushes through.

When Elizabeth stands, I give her a grateful nod. It may seem small, but she’s given Liam something to hold onto while waiting for his mother.

She nods at the others before leaving. Taking Liam’s hand, I guide him to the chairs. I’m exhausted—mentally, physically, emotionally. Sleep won’t come until I see both mother and child.

To my surprise, Lucas, Hunter, and Victoria enter. Hunter grips Victoria’s hand tightly as they chat, Lucas trailing behind. I can’t tell if they’ve told Hunter the truth yet.

Hunter’s eyes land on Isabella. They widen in shock. Before I can process why, he yanks free and bolts toward her.

Isabella stiffens, pushing him away with a disapproving glare. Hunter’s face crumples, tears spilling.

He turns and buries himself in Lucas’ arms. Lucas glares at Isabella, as do Victoria, Nathan, and everyone else who witnessed it.

Isabella shrinks back but stays silent.

I glance at Liam. His head rests on my shoulder, eyes closed, but I know he’s awake.

"What is he doing here?" Victoria’s bitter voice snaps my attention up. She points at Damian, hatred burning in her gaze.

"He’s here for Sophia," I say wearily.

Her face twists. "I didn’t realize my daughter associated with criminals."

"Of course you didn’t," Eleanor scoffs. "You know nothing about her."

The two women lock eyes. Victoria may be the Sharp matriarch, but she’s no match for Eleanor Prescott.

"If you don’t like his presence, leave. Frankly, I don’t understand why you’re here at all, considering how you treated Sophia for years."

That silences Victoria—but stirs something I’m not ready to face.

Liam’s eyes fly open. He scans the room before fixing on me.

"What’s Grandpa Alexander talking about?" His quiet question draws everyone’s attention.

Guilt flashes across their faces. They’d forgotten he was here.

"Nothing, buddy. Just grown-ups arguing. Don’t worry about it."

He narrows his eyes. "I know what 'shit' means. Grandpa said Mom wasn’t treated well. Is that true?"

Damn. I dreaded this day. Everyone except Lucas and Hunter tenses. How do I explain without making him hate us?

"Liam, ready to meet your sister?" Elizabeth reappears, smiling.

Relief floods me. Liam’s face lights up, the tension forgotten.

"Mr. Blackwood, you’ll need to come too," she says as Liam takes her hand.

I follow them into a sanitization room, where we’re given gowns, gloves, and masks. Then, we enter the NICU.

We pass several incubators before stopping at one.

Elizabeth beams. "Liam, meet Lily."

One look, and she has me. She’s not my blood, but she owns my heart.

Lily is tiny but perfect. Her eyes are closed, but her nose, lips, and the wisp of hair peeking from her pink hat—all Sophia.

My chest tightens at the tubes connected to her. She shouldn’t be here. She should still be safe inside her mother.

But she’s alive. That’s what matters.

"Can I hold her?" Liam whispers.

Elizabeth was right—he’s already an incredible big brother. The love on his face is unmistakable.

"Not yet, sweetheart. But you can touch her if you’re gentle."

He nods. She guides his hand into the incubator. His fingers brush Lily’s cheek, and she leans into it, though she doesn’t wake.

We stay until a nurse gently tells us it’s time to go.

Back in the waiting room, I ask Nathan, "Where’s Alexander?"

Eleanor sits alone, heartbroken.

"With Sophia. Only one visitor at a time—Eleanor went first."

Elizabeth returns, asking who else wants to see Lily. Damian steps forward. No one objects as she leads him away.

"How is she?" he asks when he returns.

"Beautiful," Liam murmurs, still dazed. "She looks like Mom."

"He’s right," I agree. "She’s her mother’s double."

Silence falls. Damian checks his phone, then sighs.

"I have to go, but I’ll stay in touch. For Sophia and Lily, I’ll put our differences aside and find who did this."

"Fine." I shake his hand.

"Aren’t you staying to see her?" Alexander asks, emerging from Sophia’s room.

"Not today. Out of time."

With that, Damian leaves. Moments later, Daniel enters—escorted by police.

Did Damian rush off to avoid him? Or the cops?

Rage simmers in my veins. I’ll never forgive him for deceiving Sophia.

I stand, ready to confront him, but Alexander grips my shoulder.

"We pulled strings to get him here," he says. "As a father, you understand he has every right to be here. Maybe more—he almost lost his daughter."

I freeze as Eleanor stands and embraces Daniel. He holds her, fighting tears.

"Don’t start a fight. It’s not worth it. Go see Sophia instead."

I grit my teeth but nod. No matter his sins, he deserves to see Lily.

As the nurse calls for the next visitor, I ask if Liam and I can go together. She agrees.

After sanitizing again, we enter Sophia’s room. My legs give out, and I collapse into a chair.

Bandages wrap her head. A collar braces her neck. Scratches mar her face—likely from shattered glass. Tubes and machines surround her.

I take one hand; Liam takes the other.

"Mommy," he whispers.

No response.

She looks peaceful, as if sleeping. But we know better.

Words fail me. A choked sob escapes instead.

Come back to me. I need you.

I kiss her palm, then stroke her cheek, praying she’ll wake soon.
###Chapter 120

The morning sun painted golden streaks across the bedroom as Sophia stirred awake.

Her phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand.

She reached for it, blinking against the brightness of the screen.

A message from Daniel.

"We need to talk. It's urgent."

Her stomach twisted.

She hadn’t heard from him in days—not since their last argument.

Throwing back the covers, she swung her legs over the edge of the bed.

The hardwood floor was cool beneath her bare feet.

She hesitated before typing a reply.

"About what?"

The response came instantly.

"Not over text. Meet me at the café in an hour."

Sophia exhaled sharply.

She didn’t like the tone of his messages.

Something was wrong.

Dressing quickly, she opted for a simple blouse and jeans.

No time for makeup.

Downstairs, Liam was already at the table, shoveling cereal into his mouth.

"Morning, Mom," he mumbled between bites.

"Morning, sweetheart." She ruffled his hair.

"Where are you going?" He eyed her suspiciously.

"Just meeting someone. Be good for Gabriella, okay?"

He rolled his eyes but nodded.

Sophia grabbed her keys and headed out.

The drive to the café was tense.

Her fingers drummed against the steering wheel.

What could Daniel possibly want to discuss so urgently?

Had he changed his mind about them?

Or was it something worse?

The café was nearly empty when she arrived.

Daniel sat at a corner table, his expression unreadable.

She slid into the seat across from him.

"You look terrible," she said bluntly.

He didn’t smile.

"I have to leave town."

Sophia froze.

"What?"

"It’s not safe for me here anymore." His voice was low, urgent.

Her pulse spiked.

"Why? What happened?"

Daniel glanced around before leaning in.

"I found something. About Ethan."

Sophia’s breath hitched.

"What do you mean?"

He hesitated.

Then, quietly, he said, "He’s not who you think he is."

The words sent a chill down her spine.

Before she could respond, a shadow fell over their table.

Sophia looked up—

And her blood ran cold.

Standing there, with a smirk that made her stomach drop, was Sebastian.

Ethan’s twin.

"Hello, Sophia," he purred. "Fancy seeing you here."

Daniel’s chair scraped back as he stood abruptly.

Sebastian’s gaze flicked to him.

"Ah. The cop." His smile widened. "How… unfortunate."

Sophia’s heart pounded.

This wasn’t a coincidence.

And whatever was coming—

She wasn’t ready for it.

Three months. Three agonizing months since Sophia was shot, and she still hasn’t opened her eyes. With each passing day, the hope that she’ll wake up dims a little more.

It’s maddening. Helplessness claws at me because there’s nothing I can do. No one can.

A month after the accident, they took her off the machines. Her lungs were functioning fine on their own. They moved her to a regular room, and we all held our breath, waiting. But nothing changed. Two months later, we’re still waiting.

"Should I wait for you, Mr. Blackwood?" my driver asks as I step out of the car.

"No need. I’ll call when I’m ready."

The hospital staff greets me with familiar nods. I’ve become a permanent fixture here.

I don’t bother with small talk. Exhaustion weighs me down like a lead blanket. Sleep? A distant memory. Nights are spent staring at the ceiling or drowning in paperwork.

Liam moved back in with me. Every day after school, he visits his mother and baby sister. The strain on him is visible, but I know it won’t ease until Sophia and Lily are home.

I stop by Lily’s room first. That tiny warrior has carved a place in my heart. Her resilience? A mirror of Sophia’s.

"Ethan, you’re here! Let me get our little angel ready," Elizabeth says, bustling around.

Lily was discharged from the NICU a week ago. The doctors declared her healthy, strong enough to thrive without the incubator.

Minutes later, Elizabeth places her in my arms.

"Hey, princess. How’s my girl today?" I murmur, cradling her close.

She doesn’t cry. Just stares up at me with those big blue eyes—Daniel’s eyes. She’s Sophia’s carbon copy otherwise. A future heartbreaker.

I trace her cheek, and her tiny fingers wrap around mine. My chest tightens. She’s become my light in this darkness. Biology doesn’t matter. She’s mine.

"It’s bath time," Elizabeth reminds me gently.

I glance at the clock. Forty minutes vanished. Lily has that effect—making the world fade away.

Reluctantly, I hand her back. This part never gets easier.

"I’ll say goodbye before I leave," I tell Elizabeth, standing.

She nods, carrying Lily away. Each step feels like a punch to the gut.

The pediatrician stops me before I can leave.

"Ethan, do you have a moment?" Her voice is calm, soothing. She reminds me of my mother.

"Of course. What is it?"

"It’s about Lily. She’s nine months now, perfectly healthy. Hospital policy requires her discharge."

I freeze. "You can’t be serious. Sophia isn’t awake yet."

"I’m sorry, but rules are rules. She leaves tomorrow, with or without Sophia."

I drag a hand through my hair. "Just a few more days—"

"No extensions. Tomorrow’s the deadline."

I nod stiffly. "I’ll talk to her grandparents."

I stride toward Sophia’s room, but the door opens before I can enter. Eleanor and Alexander step out.

"Perfect timing," the doctor says, approaching us.

Alexander frowns. "Is something wrong?"

"Yes. We need to discuss Sophia’s condition. Most coma patients wake within a month. Her lack of progress... concerns us."

Dread coils in my stomach. I don’t like where this is going.

"But you said she could recover," Eleanor protests.

"Could. Not will. Her brain activity is minimal." He hesitates. "We recommend withdrawing treatment."

A growl tears from my throat. "You’re telling us to kill her."

"I’m sorry, but yes. The odds of her waking now... it would take a miracle."

I turn away, disgusted. "Then we’ll wait for that miracle. Because we’re not giving up on her."

I don’t wait for their responses. I storm into Sophia’s room and collapse into the chair beside her bed, gripping her hand.

"Please, Sophia. Come back. Liam needs you. I need you. Lily needs her mother. They’re discharging her tomorrow. Wake up. Please."

Silence. No movement. No flicker of awareness.

"They want us to let you go. Don’t make me do that. Open your eyes, damn it."

I bury my face in her sheets. For the first time since the shooting, I break. Tears fall unchecked. The dam holding back my grief shatters.

I’m supposed to be strong. For Liam. For Lily. For her. But right now, I’m shattered.

I sob silently, begging God, begging Sophia. Then—

A touch. Feather-light fingers tracing my cheek.

I freeze.

"Ethan."

Her voice is rough, barely audible.

I lift my head slowly, terrified it’s a dream.

But it’s not.

Her confused eyes meet mine.

Holy hell.

Sophia is awake.

###Chapter 121

The moment Sophia stepped into the dimly lit hospital corridor, her pulse quickened.

The sterile scent of antiseptic filled the air, mingling with the faint hum of distant monitors.

Her fingers trembled as she clutched the strap of her bag, her knuckles turning white.

She had avoided this place for months.

Now, fate had dragged her back.

A nurse in pale blue scrubs passed by, offering a polite nod. Sophia forced a tight-lipped smile in return.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket.

A message from Daniel.

"You okay?"

She exhaled sharply.

No. She wasn’t okay.

Not when every step deeper into this hospital felt like walking through a minefield of memories.

The last time she had been here, she had left in tears.

This time, she wasn’t sure she’d leave at all.

The elevator doors slid open with a soft chime.

Sophia hesitated before stepping inside.

Her reflection in the polished metal looked haunted—dark circles under her eyes, lips pressed into a thin line.

She pressed the button for the fifth floor.

The ride up was agonizingly slow.

When the doors opened again, she was met with the hushed murmurs of nurses at their station.

One glanced up, recognition flashing in her eyes.

"Ms. Blackwood?"

Sophia stiffened.

She hadn’t expected to be remembered.

"Yes," she managed.

The nurse—Charlotte, according to her name tag—smiled gently.

"He’s been asking for you."

Sophia’s breath hitched.

Liam.

Her son.

The one person she had failed the most.

Her feet carried her forward before her mind could protest.

The door to his room was slightly ajar.

She pushed it open.

And there he was.

Pale. Fragile.

But alive.

His eyes fluttered open at the sound of her entrance.

A weak smile tugged at his lips.

"Mom."

That single word shattered her.

She crossed the room in three strides and gathered him into her arms, careful of the IV lines.

Tears burned behind her eyelids.

"I’m here," she whispered.

And for the first time in months, she meant it.

[Warning: The following chapter contains content that may be triggering to some]

No. This can’t be real. I can’t be pregnant. Not now. And certainly not with Daniel’s baby.

“Why me?” I whisper, my voice breaking as hot tears streak down my cheeks.

Silence answers me. No divine explanation. No justification for why life had to twist this way.

I try to push myself up from the cold bathroom tiles, but my limbs feel like lead. Exhaustion weighs me down.

Was this my fate? Unplanned pregnancies, one after another? First with Liam, and now… this.

My vision blurs as I stare blankly at the floor, memories rushing back. Daniel and I had only slipped up once. Just once. I was supposed to take the morning-after pill, but in the chaos of everything, I forgot. By the time I remembered, it was too late.

I told Daniel. I braced for anger, but instead, he soothed me. We convinced ourselves the odds were slim.

Then the signs came—missed periods, sudden cravings. I blamed stress. I always ate more when anxious.

A sharp knock jolts me, but I don’t move. I can’t face anyone. Not now. When the knocking persists, I curl tighter, hands pressed over my ears. Just go away.

Silence. Then—footsteps. Heavy. Purposeful.

Before I can react, a shadow fills the doorway.

“Sophia?” Ethan’s voice, deep and rough, fills the small space.

Our eyes meet, and the dam breaks. Fresh tears spill. Of all people, why him?

“What are you doing here?” My words are choked.

He kneels in front of me, his gaze unreadable.

“Isabella saw you at the store,” he murmurs, thumb brushing away a tear. “She said you looked distraught. That you bought pregnancy tests.”

Damn Isabella and her loose lips! What did she think she’d achieve by telling Ethan?

“She had no right,” I snap. “This isn’t your business.”

He doesn’t flinch. “Did you take the test?”

A nod. More tears.

“And?”

I can’t say it. The words stick in my throat.

When I don’t answer, his eyes sweep the room, landing on the tests near the sink. He stands, picks one up. I should be furious at the invasion, but I’m too numb to care.

He returns, sinking down beside me this time.

“Congratulations,” he says, voice oddly strained. “You’ll be an amazing mother.”

I lean into him, my head against his shoulder. “Will I? You never wanted another baby with me, even when I begged. I thought… I thought you believed I wasn’t good enough.”

My insecurities with Ethan always ran deep. The truth? He held out hope for Isabella. It was easier to blame myself than face that he just didn’t want a child with me.

“I never thought that,” he says firmly. “You’re incredible with Liam. Anyone can see that.” A pause. “Can I tell you something?”
###Chapter 122

The moment Sophia stepped into the dimly lit interrogation room, her pulse quickened.

Daniel Carter sat across from her, his hands cuffed to the table. His usually sharp gaze was now clouded with exhaustion.

She swallowed hard.

This wasn’t the man she had fallen for—the confident officer who had made her feel safe.

This was a prisoner.

And it was all her fault.

“You shouldn’t be here,” Daniel muttered, his voice rough.

Sophia clenched her fists. “I had to see you.”

Silence stretched between them, heavy and suffocating.

Then, Daniel’s expression darkened. “Ethan Blackwood did this.”

Sophia flinched at the venom in his tone.

“He framed me,” Daniel continued, his jaw tight. “And now I’m rotting in here while he walks free.”

Her stomach twisted.

She had suspected Ethan’s involvement, but hearing it confirmed sent a chill down her spine.

“I’ll fix this,” she whispered.

Daniel scoffed. “How? You think you can take him down?”

Sophia met his gaze, determination hardening her resolve.

“I have to.”

Because if she didn’t, Daniel would pay the price.

And she couldn’t live with that.

Not again.

The door creaked open behind her.

A guard stepped in. “Time’s up.”

Daniel’s eyes locked onto hers, desperate. “Be careful, Sophia.”

She nodded, her throat too tight to speak.

As she turned to leave, his final words followed her out.

“He won’t stop until he destroys you too.”

Her steps faltered.

Then she straightened her shoulders and walked away.

Ethan Blackwood had made his move.

Now, it was her turn.

I give a slow nod.

Sebastian's voice drops to a whisper. "I've always envied the connection you share with Liam. Even now, it eats at me." His confession makes my head snap up in surprise.

"Truly?"

It still feels surreal—Ethan Blackwood sitting beside me on the cold bathroom tiles. The Ethan I knew wouldn't have spared me a second glance, much less tenderly wiped away my tears.

"Yeah," he murmurs.

Silence stretches between us. Exhaustion soon pulls at my eyelids. I don't remember drifting off, or how I ended up tucked beneath my duvet. The last sensation I recall is the brush of his lips against my forehead.

When I wake, golden afternoon light spills through the curtains. A breakfast tray sits abandoned on my nightstand, the food long gone cold.

I drag myself upright and schedule an appointment with Dr. Bennett. A scalding shower does little to revive me as I pull on fresh clothes. My limbs feel leaden, my mind fogged with fatigue.

The untouched meal gnaws at my conscience. Though I don't know for certain, intuition whispers Ethan's name.

The drive to the clinic feels endless. I crawl along at a snail's pace, gripping the steering wheel until my knuckles bleach white. When I finally arrive, I sit in the parking lot for five full minutes before forcing myself inside.

The waiting room brims with expectant mothers, many flanked by doting partners. The sight transports me back to my pregnancy with Liam—countless lonely appointments where Ethan couldn't be bothered to show. His sudden insistence on being present during delivery had shocked me then, given his indifference throughout those nine months.

Shaking off the memory, I check in with the receptionist and take a seat. Forty-five agonizing minutes later, my name echoes through the sterile space.

"Sophia Sterling?"

Dr. Bennett greets me with a warm smile. "Good afternoon, Sophia. What brings you in today?"

My fingers twist together. "I... I need an ultrasound. Home tests came back positive yesterday, but I require medical confirmation."

Her kind eyes soften as she gestures to the examination table. "Of course. Make yourself comfortable while I prepare the equipment."

The paper sheet crinkles beneath me as I stare at the ceiling tiles. My pulse thunders so violently I fear it might crack a rib.

"Just lift your top for me, dear."

The cold gel makes me flinch as she glides the transducer across my abdomen. Static resolves into rhythmic thumping—a sound that steals my breath.

"Congratulations! You're approximately twelve weeks along." Dr. Bennett beams as the heartbeat fills the room.

Tears prickle behind my eyelids. While she chatters about prenatal vitamins and dietary plans, my world narrows to that relentless pulsing echo. The printed sonogram images feel like burning coals in my hands as I flee the clinic.

Numbness carries me through the drive. Some foolish part of me had clung to hope—that the tests were faulty, that this nightmare wasn't real. Now the evidence lies on my backseat, undeniable as a signed death warrant.

I drive aimlessly until the road ends at a cliffside overlook. Ocean winds whip my hair as I approach the precipice.

How can I possibly welcome this child? A living reminder of Daniel's betrayal, conceived through deception and violence. Every time I look at this baby, I'll see the man who tried to destroy me.

This pregnancy chains me to memories I'd give anything to forget. No matter how innocent, this child will always be Daniel's legacy—a permanent scar on my soul.
###Chapter 123

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the bedroom floor. Sophia stretched lazily, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her.

Liam’s laughter echoed from downstairs, mingling with the clatter of breakfast dishes. She smiled, pushing herself out of bed.

Ethan Blackwood stood by the stove, flipping pancakes with practiced ease. His dark hair was slightly tousled, his shirt sleeves rolled up to his elbows.

“Morning,” he murmured, glancing over his shoulder.

Sophia leaned against the doorway, arms crossed. “You’re spoiling him.”

Ethan smirked. “Someone has to.”

Liam bounded into the kitchen, his cheeks flushed with excitement. “Mom! Dad’s making chocolate chip pancakes!”

She ruffled his hair. “I see that.”

The domestic scene was almost surreal. A year ago, she would’ve never imagined standing here, watching Ethan—her ex-husband—play the role of doting father so effortlessly.

Her phone buzzed on the counter. A message from Daniel Carter.

"We need to talk."

Sophia’s stomach twisted. She hadn’t seen Daniel since the trial, since everything had fallen apart.

Ethan’s gaze flickered to her phone, then away. His jaw tightened imperceptibly.

Liam, oblivious, chattered between bites. “Can we go to the park later? Caleb said there’s a new—”

“Sure,” Sophia said absently, her fingers hovering over the screen.

Ethan set a plate in front of her. “Eat.”

She met his eyes—stormy, unreadable.

The doorbell rang.

Liam bolted from his seat. “I’ll get it!”

Sophia exhaled slowly. Whatever peace they’d built, it was fragile. And Daniel’s message threatened to shatter it completely.

Footsteps pounded back into the kitchen.

“Mom!” Liam’s voice was high with panic. “There’s a man—he says he’s here for you.”

Sophia’s blood ran cold.

Ethan was already moving, his body blocking the doorway. “Stay here.”

But she followed anyway.

The man at the door was tall, his expression grim. A badge glinted at his hip.

“Sophia Blackwood?” he said. “I’m Detective Harrison. We need you to come with us.”

Her pulse roared in her ears. “Why?”

The detective’s gaze flicked to Ethan, then back to her. “It’s about Daniel Carter.”

Ethan’s hand found hers, squeezing once. Tight. Reassuring.

But nothing could prepare her for the detective’s next words.

“He’s missing.”

One step. That's all it would take. A single movement forward, and the endless torment would finally cease. No more pain. No more suffocating darkness. Just...peace.

The wind howled around me, tugging at my clothes like invisible hands urging me closer to the edge. In the distance, a car door slammed. I didn't turn. Not even when familiar footsteps crunched against the gravel behind me.

"Sophia! What the hell are you doing?" Ethan's voice was raw with panic.

I remained motionless. The cliff's edge called to me, promising sweet oblivion. My body swayed slightly with the wind's rhythm.

"Please," Ethan's voice cracked. "Step back. Come to me."

I felt him moving closer, his warmth radiating through the chill. Still, I didn't retreat.

Exhaustion weighed me down like lead. I was so tired—of the tears, the heartache, the never-ending battle against my own mind. The pain had hollowed me out, leaving behind someone I barely recognized.

"I can't do this anymore," my voice broke. "I just want it to stop. Just once, I want to know what peace feels like."

Ethan's arms locked around me, yanking me backward with desperate strength. I hadn't realized how close he'd gotten.

"Let me go!" I thrashed against him, nails digging into his arms. "I need this to end!"

"Wake up!" He shook me hard, his stormy eyes blazing. "Think about Liam! Are you really going to abandon him? Leave him to grow up without his mother?" His grip tightened. "And your baby—our baby—are you really going to rob them of life before they even take their first breath?"

At Liam's name, I went still.

"Ethan—"

"No." His jaw clenched. "I'm booking you with the best therapist in the city. You're going to heal. You're going to be an amazing mother to both our children. And so help me, if you ever—" His voice caught, hands trembling where they held me.

The fight drained from me. Ethan lifted me effortlessly, cradling me against his chest. His heartbeat thundered beneath my ear, rapid and unsteady. The familiar scent of his cologne wrapped around me like a shield.

"How did you find me?" I whispered as he carried me to the car.

His answer was firm. "I'll always find you, Sophia. Always."

Tears spilled over as shame crashed through me. "Thank you...for saving me today."

His lips brushed my cheek, then my temple—soft promises without words.

He was right. Liam deserved his mother. Our unborn child deserved life. They both deserved love without conditions, without the shadows of my pain.

Changes had to be made. Starting with facing Daniel—the man who didn't yet know he'd fathered a child. Which meant one thing: a visit to prison.
###Chapter 124

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow over the bedroom. Sophia stirred, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her.

Liam had already left for school.

She sighed, rolling onto her back. The silence was deafening.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Daniel.

"Good morning. Just checking in."

A small smile tugged at her lips.

She typed back quickly. "Morning. All good here."

But was it?

The weight of everything pressed down on her. The divorce. The threats. The secrets.

She sat up, running a hand through her tangled hair.

Downstairs, the scent of coffee lingered in the air. Gabriella had left a fresh pot, along with a note.

"Liam ate breakfast. Have a good day."

Sophia poured herself a cup, the warmth seeping into her palms.

The doorbell rang.

She frowned. No one was supposed to come by.

Setting the mug down, she moved to the front door, peering through the peephole.

A deliveryman stood outside, holding a small package.

"Sophia Blackwood?"

She hesitated before opening the door. "Yes?"

"Sign here, please."

She scribbled her name, accepting the box. It was light, unmarked.

Closing the door, she turned it over in her hands. No return address.

Her pulse quickened.

Carefully, she peeled back the tape.

Inside, nestled in tissue paper, was a single black rose.

And a note.

"You can't hide forever."

Her breath hitched.

The coffee cup slipped from her grasp, shattering on the floor.

The game wasn't over.

And someone was still watching.

Damn it.

My fingers tangled in my hair as I watched her sleep. The dried tear stains on her cheeks shattered something inside me. Seeing her like this—so utterly broken—was unbearable.

Sophia had always been a master at masking her emotions. But today, she didn’t. And it was brutal. The pain was swallowing her whole, and without realizing it, she was dragging me down with her.

I sank into the chair beside her bed, my fingers threading through her silken hair, massaging her scalp with slow, soothing strokes.

How had I never noticed how soft her hair was?

It was like touching heaven.

A quiet sigh escaped her lips, her face softening as the tension melted away. In sleep, she found peace—no shadows haunting her, no ghosts of the past clawing at her.

I knew it was borderline obsessive, but watching her sleep had become my guilty pleasure. I did it yesterday. And here I was again.

She was breathtaking. Even with the dark circles beneath her eyes, she was radiant.

How the hell had I ever thought she couldn’t compare to Isabella?

I pressed a featherlight kiss to her cheek before forcing myself to stand. Every instinct screamed at me to climb into bed beside her, to pull her close and never let go.

But I didn’t.

This need—this aching need to hold her—was new. Back when we were married, I avoided her touch. Now? It was all I could think about.

With a growl of frustration, I tore myself away and walked out of her house. The cold night air hit me like a slap, but it did nothing to clear my head.

I should go back.

But I wouldn’t.

She might have accepted my comfort tonight, but that didn’t mean she’d forgiven me.

Hell, I hadn’t even asked for forgiveness yet.

I would. But not now. Not when she was still so fragile.

Pulling out my phone, I dialed Sebastian. He answered on the first ring.

"Meet me at the club," I said, then hung up.

I didn’t wait for a response. I knew he’d come.

One last glance at Sophia’s house, then I slid into my car and drove off.

Thirty minutes later, I was at Viper, my most exclusive club. The bouncer at the VIP entrance dipped his head in greeting.

"Sir."

I nodded curtly and strode inside.

The bass thrummed through my skull, the noise only amplifying my headache. The bouncer cleared a path, leading me to my private booth where the chaos dulled to a murmur.

My personal bartender appeared instantly, handing me a glass of bourbon—neat. He knew my drink just as well as he knew Sebastian’s and Nathan’s.

"You look like hell," Sebastian drawled, sliding into the seat across from me.

Three minutes younger than me, and yet he acted like he had decades of wisdom over me. Where I brooded, he thrived in the spotlight.

"Just peachy," I muttered, tipping the glass back.

But the alcohol did nothing to erase the image burned into my mind—Sophia standing on that cliff, so close to the edge.

That single step she took forward had nearly stopped my heart.

The fear that gripped me was unlike anything I’d ever felt. It was suffocating.

If I’d been even a second later…

I didn’t want to think about it.

But one thing was certain—if she had died today, my heart would have died with her.
###Chapter 125

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the manicured lawns of the Blackwood estate. Sophia stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, her fingers tracing the condensation on the glass. The weight of the past few weeks pressed heavily on her shoulders.

Liam’s laughter echoed from the garden, where he played with Thor, Lucas Montgomery’s energetic husky. The sound was a balm to her frayed nerves.

Ethan Blackwood’s presence loomed behind her before she even heard his footsteps. His cologne—something dark and woodsy—wrapped around her like an unspoken question.

"You’re avoiding me," he murmured, his voice low enough that only she could hear.

Sophia didn’t turn. "I’ve been busy."

A beat of silence. Then, his hand brushed against hers, sending an electric jolt up her arm. "Liar."

She exhaled sharply. "What do you want, Ethan?"

"Answers." His grip tightened slightly. "Why did you leave that night without a word?"

The memory of their last encounter—heated whispers in the dim light of his study—flashed through her mind. She had fled before dawn, unable to face what it meant.

Before she could reply, her phone buzzed. A message from Daniel Carter lit up the screen: We need to talk.

Ethan’s gaze dropped to the phone, his jaw tightening. "Still seeing the cop?"

Sophia slipped the phone into her pocket. "That’s none of your business."

His laugh was humorless. "Everything about you is my business, Sophia. Always has been."

The intensity in his eyes made her breath hitch. She took a step back, but he followed, closing the distance between them.

Then, a crash from the hallway shattered the moment.

They turned just in time to see Gabriella, Liam’s nanny, stumbling into the room, her face pale. "Mr. Blackwood—someone’s here. They’re demanding to see you."

Ethan’s expression darkened. "Who?"

Before Gabriella could answer, a familiar voice cut through the tension.

"Hello, brother."

Sebastian Blackwood stood in the doorway, his smirk as sharp as a blade. "Miss me?"

Sophia’s blood ran cold.

Ethan stepped in front of her, shielding her instinctively. "What the hell are you doing here?"

Sebastian’s gaze flicked to Sophia, lingering just a second too long. "I heard there was a family reunion. Wouldn’t want to miss it."

The air thickened with unspoken threats.

Liam’s voice piped up from the garden, oblivious to the storm brewing inside. "Mom! Thor dug up the roses again!"

Sophia forced a smile. "Be right there, sweetheart."

Sebastian’s grin widened. "Cute kid."

Ethan’s voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "If you so much as look at him—"

"Relax," Sebastian interrupted, holding up his hands. "I’m just here to talk."

But Sophia knew better.

Nothing with Sebastian was ever just anything.

"You forget I know you better than you know yourself, brother." Sebastian drops into the chair across from me, his gaze sharp.

"Sophia." Her name escapes my lips like a wounded whisper.

"You care about her."

"Of course I fucking care about her. She's the mother of my son," I snap, frustration boiling over.

Everything about this situation was infuriating. She was unraveling, and I had no idea how to pull her back. Years of pushing her away left me clueless about what she truly needed.

"It's more than that, Ethan. You're just too stubborn to see it," Sebastian drawls, swirling his drink.

He kept harping on the same damn point—that my concern for Sophia ran deeper than I admitted. We'd argued about it endlessly. Love? No. I cared about her, felt things I couldn't name, but love? Impossible.

"How is she?" he asks when I stay silent.

"She's pregnant."

His eyes widen, jaw slack. "Daniel's?"

"Who else?" I grit out.

When I found out yesterday, something inside me fractured. The reality of her carrying that bastard's child hit like a sledgehammer. I'd been in denial about her sleeping with Daniel, but this? This was undeniable proof.

A primal rage had surged through me—the urge to rip Daniel apart for touching what was mine. Then I shut it down. Pretended it never happened. Because if I didn't, I'd lose control.

Now, knowing she'd moved on enough to let another man claim her? It fucking gutted me. I couldn't explain it, but it felt like part of me had died.

"So what's she going to do?" Sebastian pulls me back to the present.

"I don't know," I murmur, staring into my whiskey.

I consider telling him about the cliff but stop myself. She'd been through enough. That moment of despair was hers alone. She deserved protection, and I'd make sure she got it.

"Sir, this came for you." Xavier, my bartender, slides a small envelope across the table before retreating.

"What is it?" Sebastian leans forward, curiosity piqued.

"No idea." I tear it open.

A single sheet of paper falls out. I unfold it, and the words ignite a cold fury.

[I don’t target children, so your son is safe. But the rest of your loved ones? Fair game. I’m coming for you, Ethan Blackwood—and everyone you care about.]

The Reaper’s insignia marks the bottom.

Fear should grip me, but it doesn’t. Only one thing matters: Liam is safe.

The terror I felt seeing her on that cliff? Never again. It was time to bring Liam home. He’d always been Sophia’s lifeline. Now, more than ever, she needed him.
###Chapter 126

The moment Sophia stepped into the dimly lit hospital corridor, her pulse quickened.

The sterile scent of antiseptic filled the air, sharp and unforgiving.

Her fingers trembled as she clutched her coat tighter around herself.

Liam had been rushed here after the accident.

Her mind replayed the phone call—Ethan’s voice, strained and urgent.

"Sophia, it's Liam. There's been an accident."

Her breath hitched.

She rounded the corner, her heels clicking against the linoleum floor.

The waiting area was eerily quiet, save for the distant hum of a vending machine.

Ethan stood by the window, his broad shoulders tense.

He turned at the sound of her footsteps, his dark eyes shadowed with exhaustion.

Sophia didn’t hesitate.

She crossed the distance in seconds, her hands reaching for his.

"Where is he?" Her voice was barely a whisper.

Ethan exhaled sharply.

"Still in surgery."

Her stomach twisted.

Surgery meant it was serious.

She swallowed hard, forcing herself to stay composed.

Liam needed her to be strong.

Ethan’s grip on her hands tightened, as if he could sense her spiraling thoughts.

"He’s going to be okay," he murmured.

Sophia wanted to believe him.

But the fear gnawing at her chest refused to ease.

Just then, the doors at the end of the hall swung open.

A surgeon in scrubs approached, his expression unreadable.

Sophia’s heart stopped.

Time slowed to a crawl.

The doctor stopped before them, his gaze shifting between her and Ethan.

"Mr. Blackwood? Mrs. Blackwood?"

Sophia’s breath caught.

She hadn’t been called that in years.

Ethan’s jaw clenched, but he didn’t correct him.

Instead, he nodded.

"How is our son?"

The doctor’s lips pressed into a thin line.

"It was touch and go for a while, but he’s stable now."

Relief crashed over Sophia like a wave.

Her knees nearly buckled.

Ethan’s arm wrapped around her waist, steadying her.

The doctor continued, his tone cautious.

"There’s something else."

Sophia’s relief evaporated.

Her fingers dug into Ethan’s sleeve.

The doctor hesitated.

Then, quietly, he said the words that shattered her world all over again.

"We found something unexpected in his bloodwork."

Sophia’s blood ran cold.

Ethan stiffened beside her.

"What do you mean?" His voice was dangerously low.

The doctor’s gaze flickered to Sophia.

Then back to Ethan.

"It appears Liam was poisoned."

I'm cleaning the house. A deep, thorough cleaning to distract myself from the whirlwind of thoughts in my head.

I still haven’t fully processed the fact that I’m pregnant.

When Ethan rejected the idea of us having another child, I had given up hope of ever giving Liam a sibling.

Now, here I am, carrying another baby—unexpected, unplanned—and I don’t even know how to feel about it.

My phone rings. Normally, I’d ignore it, but not today. Pushing everyone away hasn’t helped me.

"Hi, Amelia," I murmur, sinking onto the couch.

Lately, I’ve been exhausted. I should’ve known something was different.

"Oh my God, you actually answered!" she shrieks before her voice cracks. "I missed you. It’s been weeks."

"I’m sorry," I exhale. "I didn’t know how to handle everything, so I just… shut everyone out."

I’ve never been good with emotions. When things get overwhelming, I bury them. Pretend they don’t exist.

Because feeling them? That’s terrifying.

But I’m learning—slowly—that ignoring them isn’t the answer.

"Are you okay now?" she asks softly.

"Not completely," I admit. "But I will be."

I don’t know how yet, but I refuse to stay broken.

I still can’t believe I ever considered ending my life—and this baby’s.

This child is mine. Just like Liam is. And no matter what happens, I will be a good mother to them.

I shake my head, forcing the dark thoughts away. I don’t want to remember how low I sank.

"I’m pregnant," I whisper when the silence stretches too long.

"What?" Her gasp is sharp. "Since when?"

"A week ago."

Just like with Liam, this wasn’t planned. But that doesn’t change anything.

I wanted another child. Even if I can’t stand their father right now, that’s not this baby’s fault.

"Oh, sweetheart… congratulations," she says, surprise melting into warmth.

"You sound happy. I thought you’d be upset, considering who the father is."

"I am happy. A baby is a blessing, Sophia. And maybe… maybe this is exactly what you need to pull you through everything."

Her voice thickens.

"You were drowning. I saw it. We all did. And I think this baby has done what none of us could—pull you back from the edge."

I let her words sink in.

She’s right.

It’s because of Liam and this baby that I want to heal. That I’m finally willing to get help.

"Thank you," I whisper, my throat tight. "For not giving up on me, even when I pushed you away."

Everything makes me emotional these days.

"You’re my best friend. Of course I wouldn’t give up on you."

We talk for a while longer, shifting to lighter topics. By the time we hang up, I feel… lighter.

I hadn’t realized how much I missed her. How lonely I’d been.

I’m not fully me yet, but I’m getting there.

Exhausted, I collapse onto the sofa just as the front door swings open.

I frown. Who just walks into someone’s house without knocking?

Then I hear his voice—bright, excited—and my heart soars.

"Mommy! Mommy, I’m home!"

A grin breaks across my face as I rush toward the entryway.

"Liam!"
###Chapter 127

The moment Sophia stepped into the dimly lit hospital room, her breath caught in her throat.

Liam lay motionless on the bed, his small frame swallowed by the sterile white sheets.

The rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor filled the silence, each pulse a painful reminder of how fragile life was.

Ethan Blackwood stood by the window, his broad shoulders tense, his knuckles white as they gripped the windowsill.

Sophia could see the storm raging behind his dark eyes—guilt, anger, and something deeper, something raw.

She moved forward, her legs unsteady, her fingers trembling as she reached for Liam’s hand.

His skin was cold.

Too cold.

A choked sob escaped her lips before she could stop it.

Ethan turned sharply at the sound, his gaze locking onto hers.

For a heartbeat, neither spoke.

Then, his voice rough with barely restrained emotion, he said, "This is my fault."

Sophia shook her head, tears blurring her vision. "No. It's not."

But the words felt hollow.

Because deep down, she knew—this was the consequence of their choices.

The door creaked open, and Dr. Bennett stepped in, her expression grave.

"I need to speak with both of you," she said quietly.

Sophia’s stomach twisted.

She knew that tone.

Nothing good ever followed it.

Ethan crossed the room in three strides, his presence suddenly overwhelming.

"Tell us," he demanded.

Dr. Bennett hesitated, then sighed. "Liam’s condition is more complicated than we initially thought."

Sophia’s heart stopped.

Complicated.

That was code for worse.

Ethan’s jaw clenched. "What does that mean?"

The doctor’s next words sent a chill down Sophia’s spine.

"It means we’re running out of time."

I press kisses all over his tiny face, pulling him closer until his laughter fills the room.

"Mom!" Liam squeals, squirming but not pulling away. His cheeks flush pink with delight.

"I missed you so much, my love! How are you even here right now?" My voice trembles as I loosen my grip just enough to see his face, but I don’t let go.

We’re both sprawled on the hardwood floor, but I couldn’t care less. The sheer joy of holding him again makes my chest ache.

"Dad brought me," he announces, beaming. "He said you needed me. It was supposed to be a surprise—that’s why I didn’t tell you during our call yesterday!"

Only then do I notice Ethan standing a few feet away, watching us silently. Our eyes meet, and something flickers in his gaze—something deep and unreadable.

"Hi," I murmur, suddenly self-conscious.

He’s been stopping by every single day since… well, since everything happened. Checking on me. Bringing groceries. Even arranging therapy sessions. This version of Ethan—gentle, attentive—is so foreign it leaves me off-balance.

"Hey, Sophia." His lips quirk into a small smile. "How are you holding up today?"

"I’m… okay." I shrug, because it’s mostly true. Healing isn’t linear, but I’m trying.

Liam tugs my sleeve urgently. "Mom, is it true? Are you really having a baby?"

My head snaps toward Ethan, who rubs the back of his neck with a sheepish grin.

Swallowing hard, I turn back to Liam. "Yes, sweetheart." Fear coils in my stomach. He’s never mentioned wanting siblings—what if he resents this?

But then his entire face lights up like fireworks. "YES!" He punches the air, bouncing on his knees. "This is the best news EVER! Can it be a girl? Please? I’ve always wanted a little sister!"

The sheer force of his joy unravels the knot in my chest. If Liam is happy, then maybe—just maybe—everything will be okay.



"It doesn’t quite work like that, baby," I explain gently, smoothing his wild curls. "It could be a boy, too. Fifty-fifty chance."

"No way." He crosses his arms, chin jutting stubbornly. "It’s gonna be a girl. I’m manifesting it!"

The determination in his expression is so eerily like Ethan’s that it steals my breath.

"Liam—" I don’t want him heartbroken if—

"Buddy." Ethan crouches beside us, interrupting smoothly. "Give your mom and me a minute to talk, yeah?"

Liam glances between us, then nods and bolts upstairs—he already knows the layout from our video tours.

Once he’s gone, I stand, wiping my palms on my jeans. "How did you know?" My voice cracks. "That I needed him here?"

Ethan exhales, gaze drifting to the staircase. "Instinct, I guess. Can’t explain it."

"I’m grateful, but… is it safe? Damian’s men are still out there."

His jaw tightens. "They won’t touch Liam. That’s the one thing I can promise." The unspoken even if they come for the rest of us hangs between us, but I feel nothing. Letty aside, the others can rot.

"Thank you," I whisper. "For bringing him back. For… everything."

"Anything for you, Sophia."

The words make my pulse stutter. Since when does Ethan Blackwood say things like that? I half-reach to check his forehead for fever before stopping myself.

Before I can overanalyze, thunderous footsteps barrel down the stairs.

"Mom! My room is insane—way cooler than on camera!" Liam skids to a halt, eyes sparkling.

I laugh, and for the first time in weeks, it doesn’t feel forced. Whatever Ethan’s reasons for changing, they don’t matter right now.

Because tomorrow, I have to face Daniel. And that thought alone is enough to make my hands shake.
###Chapter 128

The hospital corridor stretched endlessly before Sophia, its sterile white walls closing in on her.

Her heart pounded against her ribs like a trapped bird.

Liam’s small hand trembled in hers, his wide eyes filled with unspoken fear.

"Mommy, is Daddy going to be okay?" His voice was barely a whisper.

Sophia swallowed hard, forcing a reassuring smile. "He’s strong, sweetheart. He’ll fight."

But the truth gnawed at her.

Ethan Blackwood had been rushed into emergency surgery after the explosion at the gala.

The doctors hadn’t given her any guarantees.

Isabella appeared at the end of the hallway, her face pale. "Sophia!"

Sophia’s grip on Liam tightened.

Isabella reached them, breathless. "Nathan just called. They’ve arrested Daniel Carter."

Sophia’s stomach twisted.

Daniel—her new lover, the man she’d trusted—was behind this?

It didn’t make sense.

But then, nothing did anymore.

The doors to the operating room swung open.

Dr. Bennett stepped out, his expression unreadable.

Sophia’s breath hitched.

"Mrs. Blackwood," he began, his voice steady. "Your husband is stable—for now."

Relief flooded her, but it was short-lived.

Dr. Bennett’s next words sent ice through her veins.

"But there’s something else. We found traces of a rare toxin in his blood."

Sophia’s vision blurred.

Toxin?

Who would—

Then it hit her.

The wine.

Ethan had taken a sip from her glass at the gala.

A glass meant for her.

Someone had tried to kill her.

And Ethan had paid the price.

Liam tugged her sleeve, his voice trembling. "Mommy?"

Sophia knelt, pulling him close. "It’s okay, baby. Daddy’s going to be fine."

But inside, a storm raged.

This wasn’t an accident.

This was war.

And she would find out who was responsible.

No matter the cost.

Across the room, her phone buzzed.

An unknown number.

A single message:

"You should have stayed gone."

Sophia’s blood ran cold.

The game had just begun.

When I set my plan into motion, I never imagined I'd fall for her. That realization hit me like a freight train—the cruelest irony fate could have thrown my way.

I thought it would be simple. Eliminate her, claim what was rightfully mine. But Sophia wasn’t just another target. She wasn’t someone you could discard or forget. She was the kind of woman who rewired your soul, who made you question every dark choice you’d ever made.

I felt it the second my heart betrayed me. I fought it—clawed against it like a drowning man fighting the tide. But love doesn’t ask for permission. It crashes into you, relentless.

By the time I admitted the truth to myself, the damage was irreversible. The clock was ticking. The truth would surface, and I’d lose her forever. So I clung to her, selfishly stealing every second I could, knowing it would never be enough.

Hurting her is my greatest sin. Her pain carved into me, deeper than any blade. When she shattered, I shattered with her. I traded our future for greed, and if she never forgives me, I’d deserve it.

"Daniel, you’ve got a visitor," a guard barks.

I’d refused my parents every time they came. Shame coiled in my gut like a venomous snake. They took me in. Loved me as their own. And I repaid them by trying to murder their real daughter.

How could they still want to see me? If our roles were reversed, I wouldn’t have spared a second glance.

"Daniel…" The guard’s voice sharpens. I glare over my shoulder, icy silence my only reply.

For a heartbeat, I consider sending them away again. But something lodges in my throat. The words die before they can form.

I give a stiff nod. He gestures for my hands. The cuffs click into place, cold and familiar, before he leads me out.

I’m new here, but no one tests me. They’ve learned the hard way—I don’t break easy.

The moment I step into the visitation area, my blood turns to ice.

Sophia sits in the far corner, her posture tense, fingers twisting in her lap. The guard uncuffs me, but I barely notice. Every step toward her feels like walking through a dream.

"Sophia?" Her name scrapes raw from my throat as I sink into the chair opposite her.

I drink her in—memorizing the curve of her lips, the way her lashes cast shadows on her cheeks. This might be the last time I ever see her. She’s probably here for closure. Women need that, don’t they? Before they move on.

Her gaze flickers to mine, then away just as fast. Like looking at me physically hurts. And God, it does. Seeing her flawless face only hammers home what I’ve lost. I’ll never hold her again. Never marry her. Never watch her belly swell with my child.

The agony of it roots deep, a blade twisting in my chest. My heart—what’s left of it—aches in ways I didn’t know were possible.

"I wasn’t sure if I should come," she murmurs, voice fraying at the edges. "Or if you’d even care. But I had to."

Her uncertainty guts me. I did this. Broke her trust so thoroughly she hesitates to speak to me.

"What is it, Sophia?" I soften my tone, fighting the urge to reach for her.

She inhales sharply, then falters. "I—"

My stomach knots. "Sophia…"

"I’m pregnant," she whispers, staring at the table between us.

The world tilts. Did I hear her right?

"What?"

"Three months," she says, firmer now. "I found out last week."

A father.

The words detonate in my skull. We created life. I remember every inch of her beneath me, the way she gasped my name like a prayer.

And now she’s carrying my child.

No one else could ever be the mother of my baby. No one but her.
###Chapter 129

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Sophia stirred awake.

Her phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand.

She reached for it, squinting at the screen.

A message from Daniel.

"We need to talk. It's urgent."

Her stomach twisted.

She hadn’t heard from him in days—not since the night everything had unraveled.

Swallowing hard, she typed a reply.

"Where?"

The response came instantly.

"The old diner. Noon."

Sophia exhaled sharply.

That diner held memories—some sweet, some bitter.

She glanced at the clock.

Three hours.

Enough time to prepare herself.

The shower did little to ease the tension coiled in her shoulders.

Hot water pounded against her skin, but her thoughts refused to settle.

What could Daniel possibly want now?

Had he found something?

Or was this just another game?

She shut off the water with a sharp twist of the knob.

Wrapping herself in a towel, she caught her reflection in the fogged mirror.

Dark circles shadowed her eyes.

She looked exhausted.

Liam was already at the breakfast table when she entered the kitchen.

"Morning, Mom!"

His cheerful voice was a balm to her frayed nerves.

"Morning, sweetheart."

She pressed a kiss to his tousled hair before pouring herself coffee.

"Are you okay?" Liam asked, studying her face.

Sophia forced a smile.

"Just tired."

Liam frowned but didn’t push.

He knew better than most when she needed space.

The drive to the diner was tense.

Every red light felt like a taunt.

Her fingers drummed against the steering wheel.

What does he know?

What does he want?

The diner’s neon sign flickered as she pulled into the parking lot.

Daniel was already there.

He sat in their usual booth, hands wrapped around a coffee cup.

His expression was unreadable.

Sophia took a steadying breath before stepping inside.

The bell above the door chimed.

Daniel’s gaze snapped to hers.

No smile.

No warmth.

Just cold, hard resolve.

"Sophia."

Her name sounded like an accusation.

She slid into the seat across from him.

"Daniel."

Silence stretched between them.

Then he pushed a manila envelope across the table.

"Open it."

Her pulse spiked.

She hesitated before reaching for it.

The contents spilled out—photographs.

Her breath caught.

Ethan.

Liam.

Her.

All taken without their knowledge.

Surveillance.

Her hands trembled.

"Who—?"

Daniel’s voice was grim.

"Someone’s watching you, Sophia. And they’re not playing nice."

The air left her lungs.

This wasn’t just a warning.

It was a threat.

And it was far from over.

The moment the thought flickers through my mind, another one slams into me like a freight train.

"You're here to tell me you don’t want the baby and are getting an abortion, aren’t you?" My voice is rigid, every muscle in my body tensing as if bracing for impact.

Sophia’s head snaps up, her brown eyes blazing with fire. For a heartbeat, I see the woman she was becoming before I shattered her. The fighter. The survivor.

"Why the hell would you think that?" she snaps. "I won’t lie—when I first found out, I wasn’t in the right headspace. I thought… maybe it’d be better if this baby wasn’t born. But I came to my senses."

A shuddering breath escapes me. If she had said she didn’t want our child, I don’t know what I would’ve done. The mere idea claws at my chest.

"I came because I wanted to know what you want," she continues, her voice steadier now. "I know you don’t care about me, but maybe you’d care about the baby. Do you want to be part of their life?"

I don’t answer immediately. The weight of the question presses down on me.

"No."

The word tastes like ash. It hurts, but it’s the truth. This child deserves better than a father like me—a monster who destroyed the woman carrying them.

Sophia goes still. Then, without a word, she stands, grabbing her bag. My head drops, hiding the agony twisting inside me.

She takes a step toward the door—then stops. Turns. Sits back down.

"Why?" she demands. "Is it because I was just some pawn to you?"

"What can I possibly offer them, Sophia? I’m in prison. By the time I get out, our child will be grown. I’ll miss everything—first steps, first words, every damn milestone. And who would want a father who did what I did to their mother?" My voice cracks. I need her to understand.

Silence stretches between us. I think I’ve gotten through to her.

Then she surprises me.

"I know all that," she says softly. "But you’re still their father. Prison doesn’t change that. You can still be part of their life, Ethan. I’ll make sure of it. You don’t have to miss a single moment. This baby deserves to know you. And they’ll love you—despite your mistakes. But you have to choose to be there."

My throat tightens. "You’d really bring them here? For visits?"

"Yes."

I stare at her, stunned. Sophia is… extraordinary. How the hell did I ever deserve her? How did Daniel resist falling for her all those years?

"Thank you," I whisper, emotion thick in my voice.

She nods, standing again. "I should go. But I’ll be in touch. After my next appointment, I’ll update you. Until then… here."

She slides a small envelope across the table. Inside is an ultrasound image. It takes me a second to process what I’m seeing.

I’m not a man who cries. But damn if my vision doesn’t blur.

"I care about you," I say abruptly, before she can leave.

She freezes. Turns. "W-what?"

"I’ll regret it forever if you walk out without hearing this." I drag in a breath. "I love you, Sophia. I don’t know when it happened. Or how. But I do. With everything I am."

Her breath catches. Tears glisten in her eyes. "It’s too late for that," she whispers.

"I know. I ruined everything. But it doesn’t change how I feel."

"I saw a future with you," she admits, voice trembling. "It was so real. I was falling for you, Ethan. I was ready to give you every broken piece of me. And you destroyed it."

I stand abruptly, the pain too much to bear. I had no idea she felt that way. That she was close to loving me.

The realization guts me.

Because of my own idiocy, I’ll never be the father my child deserves. Because of my choices, I lost the woman who could’ve been my everything.

"Will you ever forgive me?" I ask, voice raw.

"Maybe someday. But not today."

Before I can second-guess myself, I pull her into my arms and kiss her like it’s the last time.

Because it is.

This kiss is goodbye. And deep down, I know—I’ve lost her for good.

###Chapter 130

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the bedroom floor. Sophia stretched lazily, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. The sheets were cold.

She sighed.

Ethan had left early again.

Downstairs, the scent of freshly brewed coffee filled the air. Liam sat at the kitchen island, his small hands wrapped around a mug of hot chocolate. He looked up when she entered, his eyes bright.

"Morning, Mom."

"Morning, sweetheart." She ruffled his hair before pouring herself a cup of coffee. The bitterness grounded her, sharpening her thoughts.

The doorbell rang.

Sophia frowned. It was too early for visitors.

She opened the door to find Daniel standing there, his expression unreadable. His dark eyes flickered with something she couldn’t place—urgency, maybe. Or dread.

"We need to talk," he said, voice low.

Her grip tightened on the doorknob. "About what?"

He glanced past her, toward Liam, then back. "Not here."

A chill ran down her spine.

She stepped outside, closing the door behind her. The morning air was crisp, carrying the faint scent of dew.

Daniel exhaled sharply. "It’s about Ethan."

Her pulse spiked. "What about him?"

"He’s in trouble."

The words landed like a blow.

Sophia’s mind raced. Ethan had been distant lately, secretive. She’d assumed it was work—his company always demanded too much. But this?

"What kind of trouble?" she demanded.

Daniel hesitated, then pulled out his phone. He swiped through a few screens before turning it toward her.

Her breath caught.

A surveillance photo. Ethan, standing in a dimly lit alley, talking to a man she recognized instantly.

Damien Slade.

The Reaper.

Her stomach twisted.

"Why?" The word came out strangled.

Daniel’s jaw tightened. "That’s what I’m trying to figure out."

A car door slammed nearby, making her jump. She turned to see Ethan stepping out of his sleek black sedan, his expression darkening when he spotted them.

His gaze locked onto Daniel. "What the hell are you doing here?"

Daniel didn’t flinch. "We need to talk."

Ethan’s eyes flicked to Sophia, then back. "Not now."

She stepped forward. "Yes, now."

The tension between them crackled like live wires.

Ethan’s jaw clenched. "Inside."

They followed him into the study, the door clicking shut behind them. The room felt suffocating suddenly, the air thick with unspoken accusations.

Sophia crossed her arms. "Explain."

Ethan ran a hand through his hair, exhaling sharply. "It’s not what it looks like."

Daniel scoffed. "Then what is it?"

Ethan’s eyes flashed. "None of your damn business."

Sophia’s patience snapped. "It is my business! You’re meeting with a known criminal, Ethan. What the hell is going on?"

Silence stretched between them, heavy and tense.

Finally, Ethan sighed. "I had no choice."

Her blood ran cold.

"What does that mean?"

He met her gaze, his expression grim. "It means I’m in too deep."

The words hung in the air, ominous.

And then the phone rang.

Sophia jumped.

Ethan grabbed it, his face paling as he listened.

When he hung up, his voice was hollow.

"They have Liam."

The world tilted.

Sophia’s knees buckled.

Daniel caught her before she could fall.

Ethan was already moving, grabbing his coat. "Stay here."

She grabbed his arm. "Like hell I will!"

His eyes burned into hers. "Sophia, trust me."

Her grip tightened. "Then tell me the truth."

A beat.

Then—

"It’s about your father."

The revelation hit like a punch.

Alexander Prescott.

Her biological father.

The man she’d never known.

Her vision blurred.

Ethan pulled away. "I’ll bring him back. I promise."

And then he was gone.

The door slammed behind him, the sound echoing through the house.

Sophia stood frozen, her heart pounding.

Daniel’s voice was quiet beside her. "We’ll find him."

She turned to him, her eyes burning.

"We have to."

Because if they didn’t—

She couldn’t even finish the thought.

Outside, the sky darkened, as if sensing the storm brewing.

And Sophia knew one thing for certain.

This was far from over.

The rich chocolate cake melted on my tongue as I savored every bite. With Liam spending the night at Ethan Blackwood’s place, I had the rare luxury of a quiet evening to myself.

For some inexplicable reason, I felt lighter tonight. Maybe it was the absence of responsibilities, or perhaps the lingering adrenaline from my earlier visit. Either way, I’d decided to indulge in comfort food—hence the decadent dessert currently disappearing bite by bite.

My trip to the prison had been… unexpected. I’d braced myself for Daniel Carter to reject the baby, to confirm every fear I’d harbored. Instead, he’d blindsided me with a confession I hadn’t seen coming.

Love.

The word left a hollow ache in my chest. He had to understand—it was too late for that now. After everything he’d done, after the betrayal, the violence, how could he possibly think there was any future between us? I wasn’t foolish enough to fall for empty words. Not again.

Still, I wasn’t heartless. I wouldn’t deny him his rights as a father, even if the thought of facing him made my skin crawl. Maybe Natalie could act as a mediator, taking the baby for visits. That was the extent of my compromise. Anything more would be self-destruction.

Men? Done with them. Love had brought me nothing but shattered expectations and scars. First Ethan, then Daniel—both had left me broken in different ways. No more. If love didn’t want me, fine. I’d focus on what mattered: being the best version of myself. The best mother.

I forked another piece of cake, closing my eyes as the sweetness exploded across my tongue. Heavenly.

“Shouldn’t you be worried about your waistline? Oh wait—too late for that.”

The shrill voice snapped me back to reality. My eyes flew open to find Cassandra smirking at me, flanked by her snickering coworkers.

I barely stifled a groan.

Cassandra—one of Ethan’s financial advisors and, as evidenced by her sneer, a proud passenger on the Hate Sophia train. Her and Olivia had always been relentless, though I’d never understood why. Sure, I’d been married to Ethan, but anyone with half a brain could see he despised me.



“I’m talking to you, you pathetic cow,” she snapped when I didn’t immediately react.

I took a slow sip of juice before answering. “Talk all you want. Doesn’t mean I have to listen.”

There was a time I would’ve shrunk under her insults, desperate to keep the peace for Ethan’s sake. Back then, I’d let his employees walk all over me, too afraid to push back. Part of me had wanted to believe he didn’t know how they treated me.

But I wasn’t that woman anymore.

“Oh, look who’s suddenly got a backbone,” she sneered. “What, did you finally figure out how to spread your legs for money?”

I actually laughed. It was almost impressive how predictable she was—so insecure that she assumed every woman climbed the ladder the same way she would.

“I’m not you, Cassandra,” I said, my voice dripping with amusement.

Her face twisted. “You bitch!” She lunged forward, but I stood in one fluid motion, meeting her glare with one of my own.

Enough.

“Try it,” I said, my voice low and dangerous. “Take one step closer, and I swear you’ll regret it. You think I’ll just sit here and take your crap? Push me, and I’ll push back harder. And trust me—you won’t like what happens next.”

Her eyes flickered to her friends, then back to me. She’d brought them here expecting an easy victory, a chance to humiliate me.

Joke’s on her.

“Are you threatening me?” She stepped closer, trying to intimidate me.

I didn’t flinch.
###Chapter 131

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the bedroom floor. Sophia stretched lazily, savoring the rare moment of peace.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand.

She reached for it, squinting at the screen. A message from Ethan Blackwood.

Her breath hitched.

"We need to talk."

Three words. That was all it took to send her heart racing.

She typed a reply, fingers trembling. "About what?"

The dots appeared, then disappeared. Then appeared again.

Her stomach twisted.

Finally, his response came. "Liam."

Sophia’s grip on the phone tightened. What now? Had something happened?

She threw off the covers and hurried to get dressed.

Downstairs, the scent of coffee filled the air. Isabella was already at the kitchen counter, scrolling through her tablet.

"You look like you’ve seen a ghost," she remarked, glancing up.

Sophia grabbed her keys. "Ethan wants to talk. About Liam."

Isabella’s expression darkened. "What does he want?"

"I don’t know. But I’m not waiting to find out."

The drive to Ethan’s penthouse was a blur. Sophia barely registered the city passing by.

When she arrived, the elevator ride up felt endless.

The doors slid open.

Ethan stood in the foyer, arms crossed. His expression was unreadable.

"You’re here," he said.

Sophia stepped forward. "What’s going on? Is Liam okay?"

Ethan hesitated. Then he exhaled sharply. "He asked about you. Again."

Sophia’s chest tightened.

"He wants to see you," Ethan continued. "And I... I don’t know if that’s a good idea."

Sophia’s nails dug into her palms. "You don’t get to decide that."

Ethan’s jaw clenched. "I’m his father."

"And I’m his mother."

Silence stretched between them, thick and suffocating.

Then, a small voice called from down the hall.

"Mom?"

Sophia’s heart stopped.

Liam stood there, eyes wide.

For a moment, time stood still.

Then he ran toward her.

Sophia dropped to her knees, arms outstretched.

And just like that, everything else faded away.

I shrug. "Sure, if that’s how you want to take it."

"One word from me, and Ethan will be on your ass. We’ve played this game before, Sophia. You know how it ends."

Cassandra smirks. "All I have to tell Ethan is that you’ve been disrespectful, and he’ll lose it on you."

Before, that threat would’ve made me crumble. I used to be terrified of stirring up more trouble with Ethan, so I’d let her walk all over me. She loved it—the power trip of reducing me to nothing.

But not today.

I flash her a cold smile. "Go ahead. Honestly? I don’t give a damn. In fact, why don’t you call him right now?" I tilt my head, daring her.

"You think I won’t?"

"I’m counting on it," I shoot back, my voice dripping with defiance.

Piece by piece, the self-respect I thought I’d lost after Daniel’s betrayal is stitching itself back together. No man—no one—will ever drag me down like that again.

"What’s going on here?" A sharp voice cuts through the tension.

I glance up to see Natalie studying us with narrowed eyes. We’re not exactly friends—more like business associates. Her family’s construction firm handles all my Hope House projects. This restaurant? Hers. The construction company is a family legacy, but the restaurants? All her empire.

"This woman is causing a scene. I suggest you remove her," Cassandra jumps in, playing victim. "We were just sitting here when she started hurling insults."

I cross my arms, smirking as she digs her own grave.

Everyone knows who Natalie is. What they don’t know? That we’ve worked together for years. Unlike Ethan, Natalie isn’t easily fooled.

"Is that so?" Her voice is dangerously calm.

I’d always kept her at arm’s length. She’d tried to befriend me, but back then, I was convinced no one would want a wreck like me as a friend. Business only.

Cassandra nods eagerly, signaling her little clique to back her up. Pathetic.



"Do I look stupid to you?" Natalie snaps. "You realize this place has cameras, right? I saw everything. And you still have the nerve to lie to my face?"

The color drains from Cassandra’s face. Panic flickers in her eyes.

"It—it was just a misunderstanding," she stammers, scrambling for an excuse.

"Get out."

Natalie’s voice is ice. "I said get the hell out of my restaurant. I won’t tolerate some entitled brat with no manners humiliating my friend under my roof."

Friend? The word catches me off guard, but I don’t have time to dwell on it.

"Are you leaving, or do I need security to drag you out?"

Cassandra scoffs, trying to save face. "Fine. The food here is overrated anyway."

A bold-faced lie. This place is legendary.

As she spins to leave, I finally notice the crowd watching. Before she can escape, Natalie calls after her.

"Oh, Cassandra?"

"What now?" she snaps.

"You and your little entourage are banned. Permanently."

The look on her face is priceless. She storms off, her so-called friends cursing her for getting them blacklisted.

"Thanks for that," I say, exhaling. "She was grating on my last nerve."

Natalie offers a small smile. "Don’t mention it."

I open my mouth to say more when a voice freezes me in place.

"Sophia?"

I turn slowly.

Standing there, with tears in her eyes, is the woman who once called me her daughter—and treated me like I was nothing.

Ethan’s mother.

And beside her?

My so-called mother.
###Chapter 132

"Sophia, can we please talk?" Victoria pleads as I turn to leave.

I freeze, studying her face. What more could there possibly be to discuss? Hadn't every bitter word already been spoken between us?

"There's nothing left to say, Mother," I reply, emphasizing the cold formality of the word.

Looking back, I realize how telling it was—the way I addressed them. While Isabella and Nathan called them Mom and Dad, I always used Father and Mother. Distant. Clinical. As if they were titles rather than family.

Deep down, I had always known. Parents don’t despise their children. They don’t look at them with disgust or treat them like a burden. I had stripped the warmth from those words because, in my heart, they had never truly been my parents.

"Please," she whispers, tears glistening in her eyes. "I’m begging you."

It’s surreal, seeing her like this—her face flushed, her expression vulnerable. This was a side of her I had never been allowed to see. For as long as I could remember, her gaze had been sharp, her lips perpetually pressed into a thin line of disapproval.

"Why don’t you show me to our table while they talk?" Rosalind—Ethan’s mother—interjects smoothly, cutting off whatever sharp retort I was about to deliver.

Natalie hesitates, her protective instincts flaring. She knew better than anyone how the Sterlings had treated me, despite blood supposedly binding us.

But Rosalind doesn’t give her a choice. Looping their arms together, she steers Natalie away, leaving me alone with the woman who had once shattered my heart.

I exhale sharply and drop into a chair. "Fine. Say whatever it is you need to say. But make it quick—I won’t sit here forever."

There was a time, long ago, when I adored her. When I was five or six, before I understood that love wasn’t supposed to feel like rejection. Before I realized she saw me as a mistake rather than a daughter.

She sits across from me, reaching for my hands. I pull back before she can touch me. That part of me—the little girl who had ached for her affection—was gone.

"I’m sorry, Sophia," she murmurs, her voice breaking. "More than you could ever know."

I stay silent.

For years, I had fantasized about this moment. Imagined her finally seeing me, finally loving me. I used to pray for it, dream of it, wish for it with every fiber of my being.

Now?

Nothing.

No relief. No joy. Just hollow emptiness.

"The way I treated you… it was unforgivable," she continues, her words trembling. "You were just a child, and instead of holding you close, I pushed you away. You loved us, and we gave you nothing but cruelty. If I could go back—if I could change it—"

Her tears fall freely now. Once, they might have broken me.

Not anymore.

Twenty-five years of pain don’t vanish with an apology. Some wounds don’t heal, no matter how many tears are shed.

"Let’s skip the theatrics," I say flatly. "If this is about my mother’s threat to your company, we can discuss it like adults. No need for the emotional manipulation—it won’t work on me."

I lean forward, my voice icy.

"So cut the crap and tell me what you really want."
###Chapter 133

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow across the bedroom. Sophia stirred, blinking against the light as memories of last night flooded back.

Liam had cried himself to sleep in her arms.

She sat up, running a hand through her tangled hair. The weight of everything pressed down on her—Ethan’s betrayal, the threats, the fear gnawing at her sanity.

But she couldn’t afford to break. Not now.

A soft knock sounded at the door.

"Come in," she called, her voice rough from lack of sleep.

The door creaked open, and Isabella stepped inside, holding two steaming mugs. "Thought you could use this."

Sophia accepted the coffee, the warmth seeping into her fingers. "Thanks."

Isabella studied her, concern etched in her features. "You look like hell."

Sophia snorted. "Feel like it too."

Silence stretched between them before Isabella sighed. "Nathan called. He’s on his way."

Sophia’s grip tightened around the mug. "Did he find anything?"

Isabella shook her head. "Not yet. But he’s not giving up."

Sophia exhaled shakily. She needed answers. Needed to know who was behind this.

Because one thing was certain—this wasn’t over.

Not by a long shot.

Downstairs, the front door slammed shut. Heavy footsteps echoed through the house.

Sophia tensed.

Then Liam’s excited voice rang out. "Uncle Sebastian!"

Relief washed over her. At least someone was safe.

For now.

Pain flickers in her eyes, but I feel nothing. She's inflicted wounds on me for decades. This moment is nothing compared to the torment she and her family put me through.

Honestly, I don’t understand why she looks wounded. The only reason she’s here is to salvage what’s left of their crumbling empire.

"You really think that’s why I came?" Her voice trembles. "That I’d only apologize to save the company? But I suppose I deserve that. My own actions made you distrust me."

It’s surreal. The woman before me isn’t the same one who once screamed at me for minor mistakes, who treated me like I was invisible. We’ve never shared a real conversation, and now, hearing her spill her heart out feels… unsettling.

"I want your forgiveness, Sophia. I want to be the mother I never was. To rebuild what I destroyed. To earn back the love I carelessly discarded."

I exhale sharply. "Let’s be clear—you’re not my mother. The DNA test in my drawer proves that. Second, that chance died years ago. Us being close? Impossible. And lastly, I don’t want you in my life. In fact, I’d prefer if you and your children went back to pretending I don’t exist. You managed it for thirty years—it shouldn’t be hard."

Some might call me ungrateful. Maybe I am. They gave me material things, but never love. Knowing what I know now, I’d have rather grown up in an orphanage.

"Please," she whispers, her voice breaking. "Don’t say it’s too late."

"But it is. You’re decades too late."

She wipes her tears, resolve hardening her expression. "I won’t give up on you. You’re still my daughter, and I’ll do whatever it takes to win you back."

I massage my temples, a headache already forming.

I don’t respond as she stands. I don’t look up. Let her live in her delusions. Nothing will change my mind. She killed any love I had for her long ago, and that won’t change.

"Before I go…" She hesitates. "Your father wanted you to have this before he died. I just never…"

I don’t acknowledge her. She sighs and sets something on the table.

Only when she’s gone do I glance at what she left.

A single sheet of paper.

With bloodied fingerprints.

It takes me a full five minutes to realize—this is the same document I saw my father hand her before his surgery.

###Chapter 134

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the hardwood floors as Sophia stirred awake.

Her phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand.

She reached for it, blinking against the harsh light of the screen.

A message from Daniel.

Her breath hitched.

"We need to talk. Today."

The words were simple, but the weight behind them made her stomach twist.

She sat up, running a hand through her tangled hair.

Last night’s argument with Ethan still echoed in her mind.

His cold dismissal.

The way he had looked at her—like she was nothing.

A sharp knock at the door startled her.

"Sophia?" Isabella’s voice was muffled through the wood.

"Come in."

The door creaked open, revealing her sister’s worried face.

"You look like hell," Isabella said bluntly, stepping inside.

Sophia scoffed. "Thanks."

Isabella perched on the edge of the bed. "Ethan called me."

Sophia’s fingers tightened around the sheets.

Of course he had.

"He’s worried about Liam," Isabella continued carefully.

Sophia’s chest ached at the mention of her son.

Liam had been distant lately.

Withdrawn.

Just like his father.

"I’ll handle it," Sophia said, though she wasn’t sure how.

Isabella sighed. "You can’t keep doing this alone."

Sophia didn’t answer.

She couldn’t.

Because the truth was, she was alone.

Ethan had made sure of that.

Her phone buzzed again.

Another message from Daniel.

"Meet me at the café. Noon."

Sophia exhaled slowly.

She had a decision to make.

And whatever she chose, someone was going to get hurt.

The folded paper lay on my kitchen table, taunting me.

I'd been home for nearly an hour, pacing, debating—should I read it or burn it?

My fingers twitched.

The envelope had weighed heavy in my purse the entire drive back. Now, it sat there, silent yet screaming.

Part of me was morbidly curious. The other part—the smarter part—knew better. The man who wrote this despised me. What good could possibly come from his final words?

I snatched it up, ready to rip it to shreds—

Just read it. What's the worst that could happen?

My own traitorous thoughts made me freeze.

Famous last words.

The worst? He could destroy me all over again.

Words were weapons. Sharper than knives. Deeper than bullets. I still carried the scars from every cruel thing my so-called parents had ever said.

OPEN IT!

Before I could chicken out, I unfolded the letter with trembling hands.

Dear Sophia,

If you're reading this, I didn't survive the surgery. Truthfully, I don't expect to. The doctors are wasting their time. I can feel it—the darkness pulling me under. Your grandparents are waiting. And hell? Hell has a special spot reserved for me after what I did to you.

You were such a bright little thing when Margaret left you with us. We extinguished that light. Broke you. And I'll spend eternity regretting it, my sweet girl.

I remember when she was still alive. You and Isabella playing in the garden. Your laughter could light up the whole house. Coming home to you, Nathan, and Isabella—those were my happiest moments.

I stopped reading, breath catching.

None of this made sense. If he'd loved me then—what changed?

Hands shaking, I forced myself to continue.

I don't know when I became a monster. After Margaret died, after we took you in—something inside me snapped. Inside all of us.

This isn't an excuse. Nothing could ever excuse what we did. It was vile. Unforgivable.

This illness? It's my punishment. Karma's a vicious bitch. I'm getting exactly what I deserve.

Before I go, I need you to know—I'm sorry. For all of it. These words will never be enough, but they're all I have left. I'm sorry for being cruel. Sorry for failing you. Sorry for being the villain in your story.

I won't ask for forgiveness. I don't deserve it. Just... take care of your mother. When she realizes what she's done, it will destroy her.

Know that I loved you. Even if I had a hell of a way of showing it.

Goodbye, my darling girl.

I crumpled the letter, shoving it back into my bag with too much force.

Why did this affect me so deeply when Victoria's tears hadn't? Maybe because these were his last words. Written while dying.

I stood so fast my chair toppled over.

Bedroom. Now.

I needed silence. Needed to shut down before the memories drowned me.

Because if I let them in?

I wouldn't survive the flood.
###Chapter 135

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the bedroom. Sophia stretched lazily, her body still humming with the remnants of last night’s passion.

Ethan’s side of the bed was empty, but the lingering warmth told her he hadn’t been gone long.

She reached for her phone, only to find a text from Isabella: "Call me ASAP. It’s important."

Sophia frowned. Her sister rarely sounded this urgent.

She dialed, and Isabella picked up on the first ring.

"You need to see this," Isabella said, her voice tight.

A link popped up on Sophia’s screen.

She clicked it—and froze.

A gossip site had published grainy photos of her and Ethan leaving a hotel late last night. The headline screamed: "Reconciliation? Sophia Blackwood Spotted with Ex-Husband Ethan in Midnight Rendezvous!"

Sophia’s stomach twisted.

This wasn’t just gossip. This was a calculated leak.

Downstairs, the front door opened.

Ethan’s voice carried up the stairs, sharp with tension. "Sophia?"

She took a shaky breath.

The game had just changed.

Weakness isn't an option right now. The price would be too steep—more than I'm willing to pay. I've already danced on the edge of my limits. I refuse to tumble back into that abyss that nearly swallowed me whole.

I collapse onto my bed, forcing my eyes to stay dry. No more tears. I've wasted enough on people who don't deserve a single drop.

Exhaustion drags me under—a heavy, suffocating weight of emotional and physical fatigue. I sink into a sleep so deep, not even dreams dare to follow.

When I wake, sunlight streams through the curtains. Eleven o'clock.

Shit.

I bolt upright, my legs tangling in the sheets as I crash to the floor. I was supposed to pick Liam up at nine. Ethan had a business flight—some meeting he couldn't miss.

I scramble through a shower, dressing in record time. Ten minutes flat. I race downstairs, half-convinced I'll trip and snap my neck before I make it to the kitchen.

Then I freeze.

Ethan and Liam are already there.

Ethan stands at the stove, flipping pancakes in a tailored suit. The sight is so jarring, I blink twice. Since when does he cook?

"Mommy! You're awake!" Liam beams, syrup smeared across his cheeks. "I wanted to wake you, but Dad said no."

I stare between them. "What's happening?"

"Breakfast." Ethan doesn't glance up. "Sit. Eat. I'm finishing these before I leave."

"Aren't you late?" My voice is sharp. "You should've woken me."

He shrugs. "Screw the meeting. You needed sleep." Like it's that simple.

This version of him—domestic, almost kind—is unsettling. A side I've never seen. One I don't want to see. Because if I let myself believe in this facade, I might forget the pain he's caused.

Mechanically, I load my plate with eggs and toast, watching him like he's a puzzle I can't solve.

Then, out of nowhere: "When's your next doctor's appointment?"

My head snaps up. His gaze is unreadable. "Next Friday. Why?"

"Just curious."

He shuts off the stove, the last pancake done. "I have to go." A glance at his watch.

He rounds the island, pressing a kiss to Liam's cheek. Then he turns to me.

I hold my breath.

For a heartbeat, his eyes flicker—something uncertain, almost hesitant. My pulse stutters.

Don't touch me.

His presence alone is suffocating.

"See you both when I get back," he says finally, stepping away.

Relief floods me.

"Okay, Dad! Bring me a present!" Liam chirps. I nod stiffly instead of speaking.

Ethan hesitates again, his expression shifting. For a second, I think he'll say something more. But then his mask slips back into place—cold, detached. The Ethan I know.

Without another word, he leaves.

I stare at the empty doorway, my mind racing.

Why?

Why act like he cares?

A bitter laugh escapes me. He doesn't. This is all for Liam. Another performance. Another lie.

That's all it ever is.

...Right?
###Chapter 136

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the bedroom floor. Sophia stretched beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming with the remnants of last night’s passion.

Ethan’s side of the bed was empty, but the warmth lingered.

She traced her fingers over the indentation his body had left, a small smile playing on her lips.

Downstairs, the scent of freshly brewed coffee and sizzling bacon filled the air.

Sophia padded barefoot into the kitchen, where Ethan stood at the stove, his broad back to her. He wore only low-slung sweatpants, the muscles of his shoulders flexing as he flipped pancakes.

Liam sat at the island, swinging his legs, already dressed for school.

“Morning, Mom!” he chirped, mouth half-full of syrup-drenched pancakes.

Sophia ruffled his hair before sliding onto the stool beside him.

Ethan turned, his dark eyes softening as they met hers. “Sleep well?”

The memory of tangled limbs and whispered promises sent heat creeping up her neck.

Before she could answer, her phone buzzed violently on the counter.

An unknown number.

Her stomach twisted.

She hesitated, then swiped to answer.

A distorted voice hissed through the speaker.

“You think you’re safe?”

Ice flooded her veins.

The line went dead.

Ethan’s spatula clattered against the pan. “Sophia?”

She forced a smile. “Wrong number.”

But the lie tasted bitter on her tongue.

Because she recognized the voice.

It was the same one from her nightmares.

The one that belonged to a ghost.

A ghost who wasn’t supposed to be alive.

Liam’s laughter filled the car as Ethan dropped him off at school.

Sophia watched from the passenger seat, her fingers gripping the armrest too tightly.

Ethan’s hand covered hers. “Talk to me.”

She exhaled shakily. “I think… I think he’s back.”

Ethan’s jaw hardened. “Who?”

The name lodged in her throat like a blade.

“Victor Graves.”

The man who had tried to kill her.

The man who should be dead.

Ethan’s grip tightened. “Impossible.”

But the dread in his eyes mirrored hers.

Because if Victor was alive…

No one was safe.

The office was a flurry of activity when Sophia arrived.

Natalie rushed over, her face pale. “We have a problem.”

Sophia’s pulse spiked. “What now?”

Natalie handed her a tablet.

Security footage from the building’s lobby.

A figure in a black hoodie, face obscured, slipping something into the mail slot.

Sophia zoomed in.

A single white envelope.

No address.

No stamp.

Just two words scrawled in red ink:

For Sophia.

Her hands trembled as she tore it open.

Inside was a photograph.

Of her.

Asleep in her bed last night.

And written beneath it:

Sweet dreams, darling. See you soon.

"Mommy, where are we going?" Liam asks as I lock the front door.

This wasn’t part of my original plan, but I knew it was necessary. Eleanor and Alexander had been calling me relentlessly, desperate to reconnect. Yet, I’d kept them at a distance, too afraid to let them in.

But today, I decided to take a chance. How could I know if they truly cared if I never gave them the opportunity? Besides, my life could use more good people.

"You’re going to meet someone special," I reply, squeezing his small hand as we walk toward the car.

As we step outside, my gaze lands on a moving truck parked a few houses down.

"Looks like we’re getting new neighbors," I tell Liam. The house had been vacant for months, its structure similar to ours, though slightly larger.

"I hope they have a kid my age," Liam says excitedly. "No offense, Mom, but this place is full of old people."

I laugh. When I chose this neighborhood, I hadn’t realized how many retirees lived here—friendly, but very invested in everyone’s business. I’d picked it for the quiet streets and spacious yards, not realizing Liam would have to trek halfway down the block to find playmates.

"Fingers crossed, baby," I say, helping him into the car and buckling his seatbelt.

Sliding into the driver’s seat, I take a deep breath. Nervousness prickles at me, even though we’ve barely left the driveway. Years of heartbreak have made me wary of anyone who tries to get close.

Shaking off the unease, I focus on the road.

"So, who are we meeting?" Liam bounces in his seat, impatient.

One thing about my son—he hates surprises. Just like his father. He needs to know everything in advance, which is unusual for a child his age.

"You’ll see soon," I tease. "They’ve been dying to meet you."

His little face scrunches into a frown, and for a moment, he looks exactly like Ethan. Same stubborn expression, same intensity.

"Just tell me," he grumbles. "You know I don’t like not knowing."

I chuckle. "Trust me, this is a good surprise."

He’s going to be thrilled when he realizes he’s gaining two more grandparents. Mostly because it means more presents and attention—he loves being the only grandchild, even if he won’t admit it.

After a quiet moment, Liam speaks again. "Mommy… is Dad going to marry Aunt Isabella?"

The question catches me off guard. My breath hitches, but the pain isn’t as sharp as it used to be.

"Probably," I murmur.

I’ve made peace with it. Ethan was never mine. Not really. His heart has always belonged to Isabella—body and soul. Sure, they’re fighting now because of her lies, but they’ll find their way back.

Their love has lasted over a decade. They will fix this.

"I don’t want that," Liam says quietly. "I don’t want a stepmom."

My heart aches at the sadness in his voice, but what can I do? Ethan and I were a mistake from the start. We never should have gotten married. I’ll always regret not fighting harder when he suggested it.

Life would’ve been simpler if I had.

Instead, we played house, pretending to love each other for Liam’s sake. Now, he’s struggling to accept anyone else in Ethan’s life.

"Liam…"

"I want you and Dad together," he insists, his voice small. "You were happy. You loved each other. Why can’t you just go back to that?"

How do I explain that none of it was real? That Ethan and I were never happy, never in love? That we were just acting for him? That Ethan has always loved Isabella, and my obsession tore them apart?

"You’re too young to understand," I say softly. "But one day, I’ll explain everything."

It kills me to see the hurt in his eyes, but the truth is unavoidable. There was never anything between Ethan and me. Our relationship burned to ashes before it even began.
###Chapter 137

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the hospital corridor as Sophia paced restlessly.

Her fingers trembled as she clutched the edge of her sweater, the sterile scent of antiseptic filling her lungs.

Liam sat quietly in the waiting area, his small legs swinging back and forth, his face pale with worry.

Ethan Blackwood stood by the window, his jaw clenched, his usually composed demeanor fraying at the edges.

The door to the private room finally swung open, and Dr. Bennett stepped out, her expression unreadable.

Sophia’s breath hitched.

"Is she—?"

The doctor nodded, a small smile breaking through. "She’s stable. You can see her now."

Relief crashed over Sophia like a wave, her knees nearly buckling.

Liam shot up from his seat, his eyes wide. "Can I see her too?"

Dr. Bennett ruffled his hair gently. "Of course, sweetheart."

Ethan didn’t move, his gaze fixed on Sophia.

She hesitated, then reached for his hand, squeezing it briefly before following the doctor inside.

The room was dim, the soft hum of machines the only sound.

In the center of the bed lay tiny Iris, swaddled in a pink blanket, her chest rising and falling steadily.

Sophia’s throat tightened.

She had almost lost her.

Again.

Liam tiptoed to the crib, his small fingers brushing against his sister’s tiny hand. "She’s so small," he whispered.

Sophia swallowed hard, blinking back tears.

Ethan finally stepped forward, his presence warm and solid behind her.

"She’s strong," he murmured, his voice rough. "Just like her mother."

Sophia didn’t trust herself to speak.

The door creaked open again, and Daniel Carter stepped inside, his uniform rumpled, his expression grim.

"We need to talk," he said quietly.

Sophia’s stomach twisted.

She knew that tone.

Something was wrong.

Ethan’s grip on her shoulder tightened.

Daniel’s gaze flickered between them before settling on Sophia. "It’s about the accident," he said. "It wasn’t an accident."

The room went still.

Sophia’s blood turned to ice.

"What do you mean?"

Daniel exhaled sharply. "Someone tampered with your car."

A beat of silence.

Then—

Liam gasped.

Ethan’s face darkened.

And Sophia?

Sophia saw red.

"I won't give up, Mommy. I told you—I want you and Dad together, and I always get what I want." Liam's voice was firm, his little jaw set with stubborn determination.

I sighed, running a hand through my hair. "Oh, my love..."

Silence settled between us as we drove through the winding roads leading to my parents' upscale neighborhood. The trees lining the street cast long shadows in the late afternoon sun.

Pulling up to the electronic gates, I entered the passcode Alexander had given me. The gates swung open smoothly, revealing the long driveway ahead.

The estate was breathtaking—manicured lawns, towering oaks, and finally, the grand house at the end of the path.

"Whoa," Liam breathed, pressing his face against the window. "This is even cooler than Grandma and Grandpa Blackwood's place!"

I smirked. Just wait until he found out whose house this really was.

Parking in front of the sprawling garden, we stepped out. Liam immediately grabbed my hand, his wide eyes darting everywhere, soaking in every detail.

Before I could ring the bell, the door opened. A butler in a crisp black suit greeted us with a polite bow.

"Welcome, Madam Prescott. Young Master Liam," he said smoothly. "They're expecting you in the drawing room."

We followed him inside, the opulence of the house impossible to ignore—crystal chandeliers, marble floors, priceless art.

Eleanor and Alexander were seated by the fireplace. The moment she saw us, Eleanor sprang up, rushing forward to pull me into a crushing hug before turning to Liam.

He stiffened in surprise as she squeezed him.

"Darling, you'll suffocate the poor boy," Alexander chuckled, watching with amusement.

Eleanor released Liam, her eyes shimmering with tears. "I'm so sorry, sweetheart. I just... I never thought this day would come."

Liam, ever blunt, tilted his head. "Excuse me, but... who are you?"

Eleanor faltered, but Alexander's lips quirked in approval at his directness.

"Liam," I said gently, kneeling to his level. "These are my parents—your grandparents. Eleanor and Alexander Prescott."

His brows furrowed. "But... aren't Ma and Pa your parents?"

I shook my head. "They raised me, but I was adopted. You know what that means, right?"

He nodded slowly. "Yeah. It's when parents take a baby that isn't theirs and love them anyway."

"Exactly."

His face darkened. "So... they didn't want you?"

My heart clenched at the protective fury in his voice.

Eleanor dropped to her knees beside us, cupping Liam's face. "We wanted your mother more than anything. But someone stole her from us when she was just a baby. We thought she was... gone."

Liam looked to me for confirmation. I nodded, watching as the anger in his eyes softened.

"But what about Ma?" he asked quietly. "Will she be sad? Do I have to stop seeing her?"

"Never," I promised. "She'll always be your Ma. Think of it this way—you're the luckiest boy alive. Five grandparents means five times the love."

Alexander knelt beside us, his voice rough with emotion. "We just want a chance to be part of your lives. That's all we ask."

Liam was silent for a long moment before breaking into a grin. That smile was all the answer we needed.

Eleanor pulled us both into a tight embrace, her tears warm against my cheek. For the first time in years, I let myself believe this could work.

But life had taught me one cruel lesson—happiness never lasted.

The rollercoaster was far from over.
###Chapter 138

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the hospital corridor as Sophia paced restlessly.

Her fingers trembled as she clutched her phone, the screen dark and silent.

Liam had been missing for hours.

Every second stretched into an eternity, her mind conjuring up the worst possible scenarios.

She stopped abruptly when the elevator doors slid open.

Ethan Blackwood stepped out, his expression grim.

Sophia’s breath hitched.

"Any news?" she demanded, her voice sharper than intended.

Ethan’s jaw tightened. "Not yet."

The words sent a fresh wave of dread through her.

She turned away, pressing a hand to her mouth to stifle a sob.

Ethan moved closer, his presence both a comfort and a torment.

"We’ll find him," he said quietly.

Sophia wanted to believe him.

But the fear was a living thing, coiled tight in her chest.

Her phone buzzed suddenly, making her jump.

An unknown number flashed on the screen.

Her pulse roared in her ears as she answered.

A distorted voice spoke, sending ice through her veins.

"Want your son back? Come alone."

The line went dead.

Sophia’s knees nearly buckled.

Ethan’s hand shot out to steady her. "What is it?"

She met his gaze, her own filled with terror.

"They have Liam."

The words hung between them, heavy with implication.

Ethan’s eyes darkened. "We’re not playing by their rules."

Sophia shook her head. "I have to go."

He grabbed her arm. "It’s a trap."

She yanked free. "I don’t care!"

The desperation in her voice silenced him.

For a long moment, they simply stared at each other.

Then Ethan exhaled sharply. "Fine. But we do this smart."

Sophia nodded, though her mind was already racing ahead.

She would get Liam back.

No matter the cost.

The hospital faded around her as a single thought consumed her.

Whoever took her son would regret it.

My fingers drum against my knees as I sit in the sterile waiting room of the clinic, my heartbeat erratic. The fluorescent lights hum overhead, casting a clinical glow over everything.

I was nervous—no, that wasn’t strong enough. I was a mess.

This felt like déjà vu. My second pregnancy, and once again, I was alone for my appointment. The only difference? Last time, Ethan Blackwood chose not to come. This time, Daniel Carter couldn’t be here.

I’d been in denial for weeks, refusing to acknowledge the changes in my body until my clothes stopped fitting. Now, the evidence was undeniable—my baby bump was showing. Soon, everyone would know.

A heavy sigh escapes me. I needed to tell my parents. But how? How do you explain that their biological daughter is carrying their adopted son’s child? The whole situation was a tangled mess, but there was no undoing it. This baby was coming, whether I was ready or not.

"I can feel your anxiety from across the damn room, Sophia."

That deep, familiar voice snaps me out of my spiraling thoughts.

I whip my head around so fast my neck protests. My breath catches. There he is—Ethan Blackwood, standing in the middle of the clinic like he belongs here. His storm-gray eyes lock onto mine, intense as ever. He looks… relaxed. Smiling, even.

Since when did he smile at me?

"Ethan?" My voice comes out strained. "What are you doing here?"

He shrugs, that infuriatingly casual gesture of his. "Support. Didn’t want you sitting here alone."

I blink. Once. Twice.

Something was wrong. This had to be a trick. A fever dream.

I reach out without thinking, pressing the back of my hand to his forehead.

His brows furrow. "What the hell are you doing?"

"Checking if you’re delirious."

He swats my hand away, but there’s no real irritation in it. Just that same unsettling calm.

Before I can demand answers, my name is called.

Ethan’s fingers curl around mine, tugging me to my feet. He leads me toward the exam room, his grip firm but not unkind. I stare at his broad back, baffled.

Dr. Bennett greets us with her usual cheer. "Sophia! Ready to check on your little one?"

I nod mutely, still reeling.

Her gaze flicks to Ethan. "And I’m guessing this is the father?"

"No!" The word bursts out of me before Ethan can respond. "He’s just—here. For support."

Ethan’s jaw tightens. His fingers squeeze mine almost painfully.

Dr. Bennett arches a brow but doesn’t press. "Alright then. You know the drill—up on the table, shirt lifted."

Ethan helps me up, his touch careful. I shiver as his gaze lingers on my exposed stomach. It’s surreal—the last time he saw me like this, we were in a very different place.

Cold gel hits my skin, and the ultrasound wand glides over my belly.

Dr. Bennett hums, studying the screen.

Ethan speaks before I can. "Is something wrong?"

"Everything’s perfect. Strong heartbeat, perfect growth." She turns to me. "Want to know the gender?"

"No," I say instantly.

"Yes," Ethan counters.

Dr. Bennett smirks. "Since you’re not the father, I’ll defer to Sophia."

I shake my head. "I want it to be a surprise. Like with Liam."

"Your secret’s safe with me." She clicks off the machine. "Let me print your photos."

"Can I get two copies?" I ask, remembering my promise to Daniel.

"Of course."

I clean off the gel and adjust my shirt. When I look up, Ethan is still staring at the blank screen, his expression unreadable.

"Ethan?"

He blinks, then stands abruptly. We leave in silence, stopping only to schedule my next appointment before stepping back into the world—one that suddenly feels a lot more complicated.
###Chapter 139

The moment Sophia stepped into the hospital room, her heart clenched.

Liam lay motionless on the bed, his small frame swallowed by the sterile white sheets.

Ethan stood by the window, his back rigid, his knuckles white where they gripped the windowsill.

She could feel the tension in the air, thick and suffocating.

"Liam," she whispered, rushing to his side.

His face was pale, his breathing shallow.

A monitor beeped steadily beside him, the sound grating against her nerves.

Ethan turned, his expression unreadable.

"You came," he said, his voice rough.

"Of course I came," she snapped, her fingers brushing Liam's forehead. "What happened?"

Ethan exhaled sharply. "He collapsed at school. They said it was exhaustion, but—"

"But what?" Sophia pressed.

Ethan's jaw tightened. "They found something in his bloodwork. They’re running more tests."

Sophia's stomach twisted.

She couldn’t lose him. Not again.

The door creaked open, and Dr. Bennett stepped in, her expression grave.

"I need to speak with both of you," she said quietly.

Sophia's pulse spiked.

This wasn’t good.

Ethan moved closer, his presence a silent anchor.

Dr. Bennett hesitated, then spoke.

"It’s not exhaustion. Liam’s condition is more serious than we thought."

Sophia’s breath hitched.

"How serious?" Ethan demanded.

Dr. Bennett met their gazes.

"We believe it’s a rare blood disorder. Without immediate treatment, his body won’t be able to fight it."

Sophia swayed, her vision blurring.

Ethan’s hand shot out, steadying her.

"What do we do?" he asked, his voice steel.

Dr. Bennett sighed. "There’s an experimental treatment. But it’s risky."

Sophia swallowed hard.

She looked at Liam, so small, so fragile.

She wouldn’t let him suffer. Not if she could help it.

"We’ll do it," she said firmly.

Ethan nodded in agreement.

Dr. Bennett gave them a tight smile. "I’ll prepare the paperwork."

As she left, Sophia sank into the chair beside Liam’s bed, her fingers lacing with his.

Ethan stood behind her, his hand resting on her shoulder.

For the first time in years, they were united.

For Liam.

For their son.

And Sophia refused to let anything tear them apart again.

"I want to take you out for lunch," Ethan says, catching me off guard.

I narrow my eyes at him. "Why?"

"We need to talk."

My gaze darts to the street, searching for a cab. Today, I hadn’t been in the mood to drive, so I’d taken one.

"I don’t think that’s necessary. There’s nothing left to say." I meet his piercing stare again.

He drags a hand through his dark hair, frustration tightening his jaw.

"Ethan—" I start to tell him I’m leaving, but his expression hardens, cutting me off.

"I’m not taking no for an answer. Either you get in the car willingly, or I put you in there myself," he growls, nodding toward his sleek black vehicle.

"You wouldn’t dare."

"Try me, Sophia."

He takes a step forward, and I know he’s dead serious. With a huff, I spin around and march to his car, yanking the door open before sliding inside.

The engine roars to life as he gets in, and I glare at him, arms crossed.

Silence stretches between us. I’m too angry, too confused by his sudden shift in behavior. I miss the Ethan I knew—cold, distant, predictable. This version? Unreadable. Unsettling.

We pull up to an upscale restaurant I’ve never been to before. He gives his name at the hostess stand, and we’re immediately led to a secluded table.

"What’s going on with you?" I demand the second we’re alone. "You’ve been acting so… erratic. Showing up at my doctor’s appointment for a baby that isn’t even yours? You never came to a single one when I was pregnant with Liam."

He doesn’t answer. Just stares at me with that familiar icy detachment, reminding me of the man I used to know.

"You wanted nothing to do with me before. Now, suddenly, you’re everywhere. Don’t get me wrong—I’m grateful you helped me when I was at my lowest. But can we just go back to how things were? I don’t need more complications. Especially not with Isabella involved."

I don’t want them in my life. Not after everything. Not when all they’ve ever brought me is pain.

I just want to heal. And I can’t do that surrounded by the people who broke me.

A long silence passes before he finally speaks, his voice rough. "I’m sorry."

The words are so quiet I almost think I imagined them.

"I was furious at you. I refused to admit my own role in what happened that night. I let you take the blame, then punished you for something that wasn’t entirely your fault."

My breath catches. Ethan Blackwood doesn’t apologize. Ever.

His jaw clenches as he continues, anger simmering beneath the surface. "I treated you like shit when you were just a scared eighteen-year-old trying to survive. I let you go to every appointment alone. I’ll regret that for the rest of my damn life."

"Why now?" I whisper. "Why apologize when it’s too late to change anything? The damage is done. The best we can do is stay out of each other’s way."

What is happening? When I needed apologies, no one gave them. Now that I’ve moved on, suddenly everyone wants to atone?

"I’m sorry," he repeats, his voice raw. "I don’t make mistakes often, but how I treated you? That was the worst one."

The words hang in the air, but they don’t sink in. How am I supposed to forgive him? How do I forget the hell he put me through?

I stare down at the table, silent. Because the truth is—I don’t know if I ever can.
###Chapter 140

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the bedroom floor. Sophia stirred, blinking against the soft light.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand.

She reached for it, her heart skipping when she saw the name—Liam.

"Mom, can we talk?"

The message was simple, but the weight behind it made her fingers tremble.

She typed back quickly. "Of course. When?"

"Now. I’m downstairs."

Sophia bolted upright.

She hadn’t expected him to come to her house. Not after everything.

Throwing on a robe, she hurried down the stairs, her pulse racing.

Liam stood in the foyer, his hands shoved deep in his pockets. His expression was unreadable.

"Hey," he said quietly.

"Hey," she replied, her voice barely above a whisper.

Silence stretched between them, thick and heavy.

Then, Liam exhaled sharply. "I need to know the truth."

Sophia’s breath caught.

"About what?"

His gaze locked onto hers, intense and searching. "About you and Dad. About why everything fell apart."

Her stomach twisted.

This wasn’t just a casual visit.

This was a reckoning.

She swallowed hard. "It’s complicated, Liam."

He shook his head. "No more excuses. I deserve to know."

The air between them crackled with tension.

Sophia hesitated, then nodded.

"Okay," she whispered. "But you might not like what you hear."

Liam’s jaw tightened. "Try me."

She took a deep breath.

And then, she began to tell him everything.

Down the street, a black sedan idled.

Inside, Julian Cross—known only as Hawk—watched the house through tinted windows.

His phone buzzed.

A single message lit up the screen.

"Proceed."

A slow smirk curled his lips.

The game was far from over.

And Sophia Blackwood was about to learn just how dangerous it could get.

The silence between us was deafening. Lunch passed in unbearable quiet, the clinking of cutlery the only sound. His apology still echoed in my mind, leaving me unsettled. Forgiveness? Not a chance. Not yet.

Ethan drove me home afterward, the tension thick enough to choke on. Both of us trapped in our own thoughts. This new version of him—protective, insistent—was unsettling. Who was this man, and what did he want from me?

"Thanks," I muttered as we pulled up to my house. "For the appointment. And lunch."

"Don’t mention it." His smile didn’t reach his eyes.

I reached for the door handle, but his grip on my wrist stopped me.

"Tell me about your next appointment," he demanded, his gaze boring into mine.

I yanked my hand free, his touch scalding. "Why the hell would I do that?"

"Because I’m going to be there."

A bitter laugh escaped me. "Oh, now you care? You weren’t there for a single one when I was pregnant with Liam. Why show up for a baby that isn’t even yours?"

His jaw tightened. "Just accept it, Sophia. I’ll be there whether you like it or not."

"You’re unbelievable." I shook my head. "What about Isabella? You think she’ll be thrilled about this?"

"Isabella doesn’t matter right now," he snapped, his voice like ice.

My breath caught. Did he just say that? The man who had worshipped the ground she walked on for over a decade?

"What’s gotten into you?" I whispered. "Since when does she not matter?"

"Drop it," he growled.

Typical. Still a sore subject. But I knew better. Isabella never let go of what she wanted, and Ethan had never been able to resist her for long.

Done with the conversation, I shoved the car door open and stepped out. His voice followed me.

"Remember what I said, Sophia. I’ll be there."

The engine roared as he sped off. I stood there, stunned, before turning toward my house.

Then I saw him.

A man watering the lawn next door. Tall, broad-shouldered, his movements effortless. He turned, as if sensing my stare. Our eyes locked, and something flickered in my chest.

He was gorgeous, yes. But that wasn’t what made my pulse skip. It was the nagging feeling I’d seen him before.

I forced a polite smile and hurried inside.

"Mommy!" Liam launched himself at me the second I walked in.

His nanny, Gabriella, had picked him up from school since my appointment ran late. She wasn’t live-in, just someone I called when work kept me.

"How was school?" I asked, dropping my bag on the couch.

"Amazing! I aced my math test!"

"My little genius." I ruffled his hair, grinning as he groaned.

"Mom," he whined, cheeks pink. "Stop it."
###Chapter 141

The morning light filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow across the room. Sophia stretched beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming with the remnants of last night’s passion.

Ethan’s side of the bed was empty, the sheets cool to the touch.

She frowned, sitting up.

The scent of coffee drifted from the kitchen, mingling with the faint sound of hushed voices.

Sophia slipped into her robe and padded barefoot down the hallway.

Ethan stood near the island, his back to her, phone pressed to his ear. His shoulders were tense, his voice low but sharp.

“I don’t care what it takes. Get it done.”

A chill ran down her spine.

He turned, his expression shifting instantly when he saw her. The hardness in his eyes melted into warmth.

“Morning, beautiful.”

She forced a smile. “Who was that?”

“Just business.” He dismissed the question with a wave of his hand, crossing the room to kiss her forehead.

The gesture was tender, but the unease in her stomach lingered.

Liam bounded into the kitchen, his backpack slung over one shoulder. “Mom! Dad! Can we get pancakes today?”

Ethan chuckled, ruffling his son’s hair. “Of course. Whatever you want.”

Sophia watched them, her heart swelling despite the nagging doubt.

Then her phone buzzed.

A message from an unknown number.

You think you know him? Think again.

Her breath hitched.

Ethan glanced over. “Everything okay?”

She quickly locked the screen. “Just Natalie confirming our lunch.”

He nodded, turning back to Liam.

But Sophia’s fingers trembled as she gripped the phone.

Who sent that?

And what did they know?

"What? It's true, and I'm so proud of you!"

Ethan gives me that devilish smirk, and I know he’s got me exactly where he wants me.

"Can I play video games now that I'm a math genius?"

Of course. He’s been buttering me up for this.

I sigh. "Fine. One hour."

Liam bolts up the stairs, shouting "Thank you!" over and over, making me smile despite myself.

"Hey, Gabriella. You can head out," I tell our nanny as I step into the kitchen.

"Are you sure?"

"Positive. Go enjoy your evening."

She flashes me a grateful smile before gathering her things. Fifteen minutes later, she’s gone—and I immediately regret insisting she leave.

With Liam occupied in his room, I’m alone. Too alone. My thoughts spiral unchecked.

I’m just debating whether to start dinner early when the front door swings open.

"Yoohoo! Sophia, where are you?"

Amelia’s voice instantly lifts my mood.

"Kitchen!" I call back.

Seconds later, she strolls in—followed by Natalie.

"Look who I ran into! Perfect timing," Amelia says, hopping onto a stool at the island.

After I’d told Amelia how Natalie defended me against Cassandra, she’d instantly approved. Anyone who stood up for me earned her respect.

"What brings you here?" I ask Natalie.

She grins. "You gave me an inch at the restaurant, so I took a mile. I’ve always wanted to be your friend. So… here I am."

A part of me hesitates, whispering to shut her out. But I silence it. It’s time to stop pushing people away.

"Welcome to my humble abode, then."

Her smile is warm, and I return it, genuinely glad she’s here.

Amelia leans forward. "Okay, but I came for a reason. Have you seen the gossip column? It dropped an hour ago."

"No. Why?"

She hands me her phone. The headline makes my stomach drop.

[Billionaire Ethan Blackwood Spotted on Lunch Date with Ex-Wife Sophia Sterling—Months After Divorce, Weeks After Dating Rumors with Her Sister, Isabella Sterling]

Beneath it: a photo of Ethan guiding me into the restaurant, his hand resting possessively on my lower back.

"Shit," I mutter. "This is going to cause chaos."

Isabella will lose it. I’m not afraid of her, but I don’t need the drama. The photo screams intimacy—something that wasn’t there. To anyone looking, it’d seem like we’re tangled in something more.

"Is there something you’re not telling me?" Amelia asks, while Natalie watches us silently.

"Nothing happened. He showed up unannounced at my appointment, then asked to talk over lunch." I recap everything, including his apology.

By the end, I’m more confused than ever. None of it makes sense, no matter how I twist it.

"What if he’s actually sorry?" Amelia presses.

That question has haunted me since he apologized. I’ve shoved it aside because I’m not ready to face it.

"I don’t know," I admit, defeated. "Forgiveness isn’t free. He hasn’t earned it. All he’s done is leave me with more questions."

How do I move on? For nine years, he made sure I knew he despised me. Now, suddenly, he’s remorseful?

His whiplash-inducing change doesn’t feel real. People don’t transform overnight.

Amelia turns to Natalie. "Thoughts? You’ve been quiet."

Natalie studies me. "I think this is what a man does when he doesn’t realize he’s in love."

I burst out laughing. "Good one, Natalie. Ethan doesn’t love me."

Please. He made that crystal clear when he stormed into my house, defending his precious Isabella.

"Think about it," Natalie insists.

Amelia nods. "She might be right. Why else would he suddenly care? Unless he always did but never knew. And why chase you now that you’re divorced? Maybe losing you forced him to face his feelings."

I refuse to entertain this. Instead of answering, I change the subject. Thankfully, they drop it.

The rest of the evening is perfect. Laughter, easy conversation—Natalie slots seamlessly into our circle.

But despite the joy, their words linger.

Ethan Blackwood, in love with me? Impossible.

They have to be wrong.

Because Ethan has only ever loved one woman.

And her name is Isabella Sterling.
###Chapter 142

The morning light filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow over the room. Sophia stretched lazily, her body still humming with the remnants of last night’s passion.

Beside her, Ethan Blackwood lay sprawled across the sheets, his muscular frame relaxed in sleep. The sight of him sent a thrill through her.

She traced a finger along his jawline, marveling at how different he was now compared to the cold, distant man she’d once known.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand.

Sophia reached for it, frowning at the notification. A message from Daniel Carter.

"We need to talk. It’s urgent."

Her stomach twisted. Daniel had been her lifeline during the darkest days of her divorce. But now, with Ethan back in her life, things were… complicated.

She bit her lip, debating whether to respond.

Ethan stirred beside her, his arm sliding possessively around her waist. "Who’s texting you this early?" His voice was rough with sleep.

Sophia hesitated. "Daniel."

Ethan’s grip tightened slightly. "What does he want?"

She exhaled. "He says it’s urgent."

Ethan sat up, his expression darkening. "Tell him to back off."

Sophia met his gaze. "It’s not that simple."

A knock at the door interrupted them.

"Mom?" Liam’s voice carried through the wood. "Are you awake?"

Sophia quickly pulled on a robe. "Just a second, sweetheart!"

Ethan smirked, watching her scramble. "You’re adorable when you’re flustered."

She shot him a glare before opening the door.

Liam stood there, his eyes darting between her and Ethan. "Uh… breakfast is ready."

Sophia smoothed his hair. "We’ll be right down."

Once Liam left, Ethan pulled her close. "We’re not done with this conversation."

She sighed. "I know."

Downstairs, the scent of pancakes filled the air. Isabella was already at the table, sipping coffee. "About time," she teased.

Sophia ignored her, focusing on Liam. "Did you sleep well?"

He nodded, but his gaze kept flicking to Ethan.

Ethan took a seat, his presence commanding as always. "So, what’s the plan for today?"

Isabella smirked. "Well, since someone kept you two up all night—"

"Isabella," Sophia hissed.

Liam looked confused. "What does that mean?"

Ethan chuckled. "Nothing, kid. Eat your pancakes."

Sophia’s phone buzzed again. Daniel.

"I know about Ethan’s past. Meet me at noon. Don’t tell him."

Her blood ran cold.

What the hell did Daniel know?

And more importantly—what would Ethan do if he found out?

The morning air was crisp and refreshing. With nothing pressing on my schedule, I found myself lounging at home, savoring the rare moment of peace.

Liam had already left for school, leaving the house quiet. After my recent emotional breakdown, I’d made the decision to step back from work. My students weren’t thrilled, but they understood—I hadn’t been myself lately.

I planned to return after the baby arrived. For now, my focus was on my children and the Hope Foundation.

The past few weeks had been a whirlwind. Everyone’s behavior had shifted—except for Isabella, who remained as spiteful as ever. The others? It was like they’d woken up with entirely new personalities.

Shaking off the thought, I grabbed my phone and dialed my mother. She answered instantly.

"Hey, Mom," I greeted, still adjusting to calling her that.

"Sophia!" Her voice was bright with excitement. "Alexander, darling, our girl is on the phone!"

There was a rustling sound before the line filled with a faint echo—she’d put me on speaker.

"Hi, Dad," I added.

Their love story was something out of a fairy tale. Together since they were thirteen, still inseparable after thirty-five years. If I still believed in love, theirs was the kind I’d want.

But I didn’t. I’d accepted that love wasn’t in the cards for me. My future was my children, and that was enough.

"How are you, sweetheart?" Dad asked.

"Good. Just wanted to check in," I replied, avoiding the topic of my pregnancy.

I hadn’t told them yet. Even as my bump grew, oversized shirts hid it well. The real issue was Daniel—he still refused to let them visit. It hurt them, though they’d never admit it.

As for Daniel… I understood his guilt. He couldn’t face them, convinced he didn’t deserve their kindness.

I’d sent him the latest ultrasound. His response had been heartfelt—grateful, eager to meet the baby. He’d even agreed to wait until birth to learn the gender.

"Sophia?" Mom’s voice snapped me back.

"Sorry. Got lost in thought," I murmured.

"It’s fine, darling. Are you still coming this weekend?"

"Yes, but Liam won’t be there. It’s his weekend with his father."

The Sharp and Blackwood families used to have monthly gatherings. I was rarely invited, and when I was, I might as well have been invisible. The only one who ever acknowledged me was Liam. Most times, I left early or hid in the bathroom, fighting tears.

It had been months since the last one. Now that my parents were back, the tradition had resumed.

"Shame he can’t make it, but we’re happy you’re coming," Dad said.

I opened my mouth to respond when a noise interrupted me—a bark, then scratching. At first, I thought I’d imagined it. Then it happened again.

"Dad, I’ll call you back. Something’s up," I said distractedly.

"Alright, honey."

Hanging up, I followed the sound to the backyard.

And froze.

A massive Siberian Husky stood in the middle of my kitchen garden, everything I’d planted torn to shreds. The soil was a mess, not a single sprout left.

My jaw dropped.

"Do you have any idea how long that took me?" I hissed.

The dog—definitely a male—dropped to the ground, giving me the most pitiful puppy eyes.

"Oh no. Don’t even try that," I snapped. "I wanted organic food, so I put in hours of work. And you just destroyed it all."

He whined, but I wasn’t budging.

"How are you going to fix this, huh?"

The longer I stared, the harder it was to stay mad. He was enormous, fluffy, and ridiculously cute—thick black-and-white fur, piercing gray eyes that reminded me of Ethan and Liam’s.

Great. Even the dog had their eyes.
###Chapter 143

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the bedroom floor. Sophia stretched lazily, savoring the rare moment of peace.

Her phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand.

She groaned, reaching for it. The screen flashed with an unknown number.

Her fingers hesitated before swiping to answer.

"Sophia Blackwood?" A deep, unfamiliar voice sent a chill down her spine.

"Yes?" She sat up abruptly, gripping the phone tighter.

"You should be more careful about the company you keep." The line went dead.

Sophia stared at the screen, her pulse racing.

A soft knock at the door made her jump.

"Mom?" Liam’s voice was muffled through the wood.

She exhaled shakily before calling out, "Come in, sweetheart."

The door creaked open, revealing her son’s tousled hair and sleepy eyes. "Did I wake you?"

She forced a smile. "No, I was already up."

Liam shuffled closer, frowning. "You look weird."

Sophia ruffled his hair. "Just tired."

He didn’t look convinced but shrugged. "Can we have pancakes?"

"Sure." She stood, pushing the unsettling call to the back of her mind.

Downstairs, the scent of coffee filled the kitchen. Ethan was already at the counter, scrolling through his tablet.

He glanced up, his sharp gaze immediately narrowing. "What’s wrong?"

Sophia hesitated. "Just a weird call."

Ethan set the tablet down. "What kind of weird?"

She bit her lip. "A threat. Or a warning. I don’t know."

His jaw tightened. "Number?"

"Blocked."

Liam tugged at her sleeve. "Mom, the pancakes?"

She blinked, refocusing. "Right."

Ethan moved to the stove, taking over. "I’ll handle breakfast. You call Harrison."

Sophia nodded, stepping into the hallway.

Her lawyer answered on the first ring. "Sophia?"

She relayed the call, her voice low.

Harrison sighed. "I’ll look into it. But be careful."

She hung up, her unease growing.

Back in the kitchen, Ethan slid a plate of golden pancakes toward Liam. The boy grinned, oblivious.

Sophia watched them, her chest tight.

Someone was watching.

And they weren’t happy.

"Honestly, I've never seen anyone's heart melt so fast over my dog. Most people find him utterly unbearable," the warm, deep voice made me spin around so quickly I nearly gave myself whiplash.

Holy hell.

Up close, the man was breathtaking. Jet-black hair, emerald green eyes that could pierce through steel, sharp cheekbones, a jawline carved by the gods, lips that promised sin, and a body that screamed temptation. He was ridiculously attractive—and he knew it.

I could practically hear the warning bells in my head. "Slow down, Sophia. You’ve been burned by pretty faces before. Don’t make the same mistake twice."

I wasn’t. I’d sworn off love and men, but that didn’t mean I couldn’t admire a masterpiece when I saw one. I wasn’t dead.

"Have we met before?" The words slipped out before I could stop them. "You just... look familiar."

He studied me for a long moment before answering. "Yeah. Same school. You were two years below me."

I racked my brain, but nothing clicked. Probably because I’d been too busy obsessing over Ethan to notice anyone else.

"Lucas Montgomery," he supplied when I kept staring blankly.

The second he said his name, it hit me.

"Oh my God—Nerd Lucas?" I blurted out, then immediately cringed at my own volume.

He groaned at the old nickname, shooting me a glare that did absolutely nothing to intimidate me.

"Wow. Talk about a glow-up," I said, still gaping.

The Lucas I remembered was scrawny, with thick glasses constantly sliding down his nose, braces, and a face full of angry red acne. He’d been the library ghost while the rest of his peers were sneaking off to make out in supply closets.

In short—not someone you’d glance at twice.

Now? Now he was devastating. The kind of man women fantasized about. The kind who could stand toe-to-toe with Ethan Blackwood in the looks department.

"Yeah, well. Thanks," he muttered, clearly uncomfortable.

"I also remember you had the biggest crush on Isabella. How’d that work out for you?" I teased, not meaning any harm.

Back then, when he wasn’t buried in books, he’d trailed after Isabella like a lovesick puppy. The only problem? Isabella only had eyes for Ethan. When they got together, they became the golden couple—every guy wanted to be Ethan, every girl wanted to be Isabella.

"And you were head over heels for Ethan. How’d that work out for you?" he shot back, irritation flashing in his eyes.

"Touché," I murmured.

The old ache flared, but I shoved it down.

I didn’t know Lucas well, but I thanked God on his behalf. Thanked Him for sparing Lucas from Isabella’s love—because her love for Ethan would’ve destroyed him, just like Ethan’s love for her destroyed me.

"Dad, can I watch TV?" A sweet voice pulled me from my thoughts.

I turned to see an adorable little boy standing behind Lucas, with the same striking green eyes.

"Hi, I’m Sophia," I said, unable to resist.

"Hi," he replied shyly, and my heart instantly melted.

"What’s your name?" I asked gently.

"Hunter."

"I have a son around your age—Liam. You should come over and meet him after school. He’d love a new friend." I glanced at Lucas. "If that’s okay with your dad, of course."

Hunter looked up at Lucas. A silent exchange passed between them before Lucas sighed in defeat.

"Fine," he muttered.

I studied him, my gaze locked onto his. There was something in his eyes—something raw and wounded, something that called to the broken pieces inside me.

He shifted uncomfortably. "Look, I’m sorry about Thor wrecking your garden. I’ll send someone to fix it tomorrow."

Thor. Fitting name for the massive husky.

"Thor," Lucas called, and the dog trotted obediently to his side.

After a brief nod from Lucas and a shy smile from Hunter, they disappeared through a gap in the hedge I’d never noticed before.

I stood there, watching their retreating figures until they vanished into the house next door. Only then did I realize what I’d seen in Lucas’s eyes.

Pain. Hurt. A soul as fractured as mine.

In him, I saw a reflection of my own darkness—the kind I’d spent years running from.

A kindred spirit.

And as the realization settled over me, one question burned in my mind:

What—or who—had hurt him so badly?
###Chapter 144

The moment Sophia stepped into the hospital room, her breath caught in her throat.

Liam lay motionless on the bed, his small frame swallowed by the sterile white sheets. His face was pale, his breathing shallow.

She rushed to his side, her heart pounding like a drum.

"Liam?" Her voice trembled as she reached for his hand. It was cold. Too cold.

A nurse—Charlotte—hovered nearby, her expression grim. "His fever spiked again. The doctors are doing everything they can."

Sophia swallowed hard, fighting the panic clawing at her chest.

Just then, the door swung open.

Ethan Blackwood strode in, his dark eyes stormy with barely contained fury. His jaw was clenched so tight she could see the muscle twitching.

"What the hell happened?" His voice was low, dangerous.

Sophia flinched. She had never seen him like this—not even during their divorce.

Charlotte hesitated. "We're still running tests, but—"

"Find out. Now." Ethan's command left no room for argument.

The nurse nodded and hurried out.

Silence fell, thick and suffocating.

Sophia couldn't take it. "He was fine this morning," she whispered. "He just had a little cough."

Ethan didn't look at her. His gaze remained fixed on Liam, his fingers curling into fists at his sides.

Then, without warning, he turned on his heel and walked out.

Sophia stared after him, stunned.

But she didn't have time to dwell on it.

Because Liam stirred, his eyelids fluttering open.

"Mom?" His voice was weak, barely audible.

Tears welled in her eyes. "I'm here, baby. I'm right here."

He tried to smile, but it was a fragile thing, breaking her heart all over again.

Then his face twisted in pain.

And the machines around them started screaming.

"Liam, have you finished your homework?" I call out, but there's no response.

It's Friday afternoon, and exhaustion weighs me down like a lead blanket. Pregnancy fatigue hits harder than I remembered—every little task feels like climbing a mountain. The only silver lining? No morning sickness this time, unlike when I carried Liam.

"Liam?" I try again, louder.

Silence.

That's unusual. He always answers right away unless something has completely captured his attention.

Before I can drag my weary body upstairs to investigate, the doorbell rings.

I sigh, rubbing my temples. Not that I don’t want company—I just crave a moment to myself. A long, hot bath sounds like heaven right now.

My day at the Hope Foundation was grueling—piles of documents, endless signatures, and a headache that refuses to fade. My eyes sting, my mind is mush, and my back protests with every step.

Reluctantly, I shuffle to the door and swing it open—only to freeze.

Lucas Montgomery and his son, Oliver, stand on my porch.

It's been two days since our awkward backyard encounter. When Oliver didn’t show up to meet Liam after school, I assumed Lucas had decided to keep his distance. He’d been downright frosty that day.

"Hi," I say, unable to mask my surprise.

"Hello, Miss Sophia!" Oliver chirps, beaming up at me. He thrusts a bouquet of pink roses into my hands. "These are for you!"

My heart melts. "Thank you, sweetheart. They're gorgeous." Without thinking, I bend down and press a kiss to his cheek.

When I straighten, he grins shyly, his cheeks pink. Just like Liam, Oliver radiates sweetness.

I glance at Lucas, who’s watching us with an unreadable expression. "Would you like to come in?"

He hesitates, but Oliver tugs his hand insistently. Finally, Lucas nods.

I lead them to the kitchen, where the scent of vanilla and sugar lingers in the air. Liam had begged for cookies and cupcakes, and despite my exhaustion, I couldn’t say no.

"Perfect timing," I say as the oven timer dings. "Fresh treats."

I grab a vase for the roses, arranging them carefully before setting out a plate of warm cookies.

"Liam!" I call again.

"Coming, Mommy!" His voice echoes from upstairs.

A door slams. Footsteps thunder down the hallway, then the stairs. Seconds later, he bursts into the kitchen—and skids to a halt when he spots our guests.

"Come here, sweetheart," I say, beckoning him.

Liam hesitates, then shuffles over, pressing against my side. He’s shy at first glance, but once he warms up? Good luck getting him to stop talking.

"Liam, this is Oliver. He lives next door. Oliver, this is my son, Liam."

I brace for awkwardness, but the boys surprise me.

"Hi," Oliver says softly.

"Wanna see my room?" Liam blurts at the same time.

Oliver nods eagerly. "Yeah!"

Just like that, Liam grabs a handful of cookies, shoves them into Oliver’s hands, then dashes to the pantry for juice boxes.

"Come on! I got a new game!" he announces, already dragging Oliver toward the stairs.

I blink. That was… effortless.

Lucas exhales, breaking the silence. "Didn’t expect that. Oliver’s usually the last kid to make the first move."

I turn to face him, having momentarily forgotten he was still here. "Liam’s the same way. Takes him a while to warm up."

Lucas shakes his head. "No, Oliver’s different. He prefers being alone. Doesn’t like making friends. At school, he keeps to himself. Honestly? I think Thor and I are his only friends."

My stomach twists. That’s not normal for a child his age.

As a teacher, I know withdrawal like that usually stems from something deeper. And judging by the way Lucas looks at Oliver—like he’s the center of his universe—it’s not a parenting issue.

Something else is hurting that sweet boy. And whatever it is, it runs deep.
###Chapter 145

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the hospital corridor as Sophia paced restlessly outside the NICU. Her fingers twisted the hem of her sweater, the fabric stretched thin from her constant fidgeting.

Inside, tiny Iris lay swaddled in a nest of wires and monitors, her fragile chest rising and falling in time with the rhythmic beeping of machines.

Sophia pressed her forehead against the cool glass, her breath fogging the surface.

"Any change?"

The voice startled her. She turned to find Daniel standing a few feet away, his police uniform slightly rumpled, dark circles under his eyes.

She shook her head. "The doctor said her lungs are still underdeveloped. They're keeping her on oxygen a while longer."

Daniel stepped closer, his hand hovering near her shoulder before dropping back to his side. "She's strong. Like her mother."

Sophia managed a weak smile.

A sudden commotion at the end of the hallway made them both turn. Ethan Blackwood strode toward them, his expensive shoes clicking sharply against the linoleum. His gaze locked onto Daniel with icy precision.

"What's he doing here?"

Sophia straightened. "Daniel came to check on Iris."

Ethan's jaw tightened. "This is a family matter."

Daniel held his ground. "I care about them both."

The air between the two men crackled with tension.

Sophia stepped between them. "Not here. Not now."

Ethan's phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, his expression darkening further. "We need to talk. Alone."

She hesitated, then nodded. "Give me a minute."

Daniel caught her wrist as she turned away. "Be careful."

She met his gaze, reading the unspoken warning. "I will."

Ethan led her to an empty waiting room, shutting the door firmly behind them. "We have a problem."

Sophia crossed her arms. "What now?"

"Victor Graves wasn't working alone." He pulled out his phone, showing her a grainy surveillance photo. "This man was seen near your apartment yesterday."

Sophia's blood ran cold. The figure in the image wore all black, his face obscured by a hood—but the tattoo snaking up his neck was unmistakable.

A serpent, coiled and ready to strike.

She swallowed hard. "He's back."

Ethan's voice was grim. "And this time, he's not leaving without finishing what Victor started."

Outside, the distant wail of a siren pierced the silence.

The game had changed.

And Sophia wasn't sure if any of them would survive the next move.

"Hopefully Liam can help bring him out of his shell," I murmur, passing him a cupcake.

I circle the kitchen island and sink onto a barstool, relieved to finally be off my feet. Taking a bite of the cupcake, I let my mind go blissfully blank.

After a moment of silence, Lucas speaks up. "I wanted to apologize."

"For what?"

"For coming across as rude the other day."

I wave a hand dismissively and turn to face him. "Honestly, I was being way too intense. Don't even worry about it."

The mention of that day brings back the memory of the raw pain I glimpsed in his eyes. Right now, he's doing an impressive job of masking it.

Most people might think he's fine, but I can see right through it. I recognize that kind of soul-deep struggle because I've lived it myself.

When you've been hurt, you develop a sixth sense for spotting hidden pain in others—especially when it mirrors your own.

"So, what do you do for work?" he asks, clearly trying to shift to lighter conversation.

"I'm a teacher, but I'm on leave for the next few months."

I'd considered going back, but ultimately decided against it. Even though the solitude sometimes bores me, I know I need this time—not just for the pregnancy, but for my own sanity.

"So, you and Ethan Blackwood... Liam looks just like him. It's eerie."

I snort. "Pretty much everyone in this city knows what happened with Ethan. We didn't 'get together.' It was one drunken mistake."

Sometimes I curse that night, wondering how different my life would be if I hadn't been so reckless. But then I remember—without that mistake, I wouldn't have Liam. So in the end, I'm left torn between regret and gratitude.

"What happened?" Lucas asks, curiosity flickering in his gaze.

My palms grow clammy. "That's a story for another day. I'm not ready to relive it."

Ethan hasn't contacted me since showing up at my doctor's appointment three days ago.

Neither has Isabella stormed in demanding I stay away from "her man." I suspect Ethan's too busy doing damage control with her—which, frankly, I'm grateful for.

I don't need him around complicating things. His recent behavior has left me more confused than ever, and I'm exhausted trying to decipher him.

"What about you? Where's your wife?" Given his age, I assume he's married.

"I don't have a wife."

"Okay... where's Oliver's mom, then?"

Pure, unadulterated agony flashes in his eyes—the kind of pain that isn't yours but carves its way into your soul anyway. My heart aches for him because I know exactly how consuming that kind of grief can be.

"She's... not in the picture," he rasps, voice fractured with pain and something darker—anger, maybe.

Damn it. I want to comfort him, but I'm not sure he'd welcome it.

"I'm so sorry," I whisper, guilt twisting in my chest for having dredged this up.

I can't fathom losing a partner. Can't imagine building a life alone when the person you loved most is gone.

Lucas strikes me as someone who loves deeply. And when you love like that, the loss cuts just as deep. It devours you.

Now I understand the root of his pain. He wasn't just hurt—he lost the love of his life.

He exhales sharply, visibly forcing the pain back down. "It's... fine. She's been gone a while. I'm learning to live with it."

I reach out and squeeze his hand, offering silent comfort.

Needing to lighten the mood, I ask if he'd help me replant my garden—since no one ever came to fix what Thor destroyed.

Talking to him makes me realize why Oliver is so withdrawn. Losing a parent that young leaves scars some kids never heal from.

I barely know them, but right then, I make a silent vow: I'll be there for them. They need happiness in their lives—and from what I can see, Lucas and Oliver haven't had much of that in a long time.
###Chapter 146

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Sophia stirred awake.

Her fingers brushed against the empty space beside her, still warm from where Ethan had been.

A soft sigh escaped her lips as she sat up, the events of last night replaying in her mind.

Ethan had held her close, whispering promises she wasn’t sure she could believe.

But the way his arms had tightened around her—like he couldn’t bear to let go—had made her heart ache.

Downstairs, the scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted up to greet her.

She padded barefoot into the kitchen, where Liam sat at the counter, swinging his legs as he munched on toast.

"Morning, Mom!" he chirped, crumbs tumbling onto his shirt.

Sophia ruffled his hair before pouring herself a cup.

The warmth seeped into her palms, grounding her.

Just then, the front door clicked open.

Ethan strode in, his dark hair slightly damp from the morning air.

His gaze locked onto hers, intense and unreadable.

Liam beamed. "Dad! You're back!"

Ethan’s expression softened as he tousled their son’s hair. "Missed breakfast with you two."

Sophia’s grip tightened around her mug.

She wanted to trust this—this fragile peace between them.

But the past had taught her that happiness with Ethan was always fleeting.

A sharp knock at the door shattered the moment.

Sophia frowned. "Who could that be?"

Ethan’s jaw tensed. "Stay here."

He moved toward the door, his posture rigid.

Sophia followed anyway, her pulse quickening.

When Ethan swung the door open, a uniformed officer stood on the porch.

"Daniel Carter," the man introduced himself, his voice steady. "I need to speak with Sophia Blackwood."

Sophia’s breath hitched.

Daniel’s eyes flickered to Ethan before settling on her. "It’s about the investigation."

Ethan’s hand found the small of her back, a silent show of support.

But Sophia knew—whatever came next would change everything.

Again.

Today marked our monthly family gathering. The Blackwoods and the Sterlings had maintained this tradition since Liam was five.

Our families had always been close—largely because our mothers, Victoria and Rosalind, had been inseparable since childhood.

It was only natural that their children would grow up as best friends, binding both families tightly together.

"Dad, why are you driving like a snail? We're gonna miss Grandpa's barbecue!" Liam whined, his little face scrunched in frustration.

If not for him, I wouldn’t have bothered coming. I used to love these gatherings—especially when I knew Sophia wouldn’t be there. When I was certain she hadn’t been invited.

Back then, I thought it was my sanctuary. The one place where everyone, except Liam, despised her as much as I did.

Now? The thought made me sick.

I hated myself. I hated all of us for what we’d put her through.

"I'm going as fast as I can," I muttered.

"No, you're not. You're driving like a hundred-year-old!" he shot back, crossing his arms.

Had I just been roasted by an eight-year-old? I snorted, shaking my head before easing the accelerator slightly.

The moment silence settled in the car, my mind betrayed me, flooding with images of Sophia.

She’d looked breathtaking when she opened the door earlier.

Like some ethereal goddess—flowing white dress, cascading curls, that soft baby bump, her skin glowing.

The urge to sweep her into my arms and disappear into her bedroom for hours had hit me like a freight train.

That reaction? Unprecedented. Terrifying.

She consumed my thoughts. Was she eating enough? Sleeping well? Should I hire someone to help her?

The intensity of my concern rattled me. I’d never cared about her well-being before. Now, the need to protect her was all-consuming.

"Dad?" Liam’s voice snapped me back.

"What?"

"We’re here."

I blinked. The car was already parked outside my parents’ estate. I didn’t even remember driving here.

Dangerous. Especially with Liam in the car. But Sophia’s ghost haunted me, stealing my focus.

"Come on. Grandpa probably saved you some ribs," I said, forcing lightness into my tone.

"Are you okay?" Liam hesitated, studying me instead of unbuckling.

Guilt twisted in my chest. I hated worrying him. But how could I explain that my turmoil revolved around his mother?

"Just a lot on my mind. Nothing for you to stress about."

He nodded, finally releasing his seatbelt. We stepped out together.

Before we reached the door, it swung open.

"Liam!" Victoria beamed, arms wide.

"Grandma!" He sprinted into her embrace.

"I missed you, sweetheart." She laughed as he collided with her, squeezing tight.

Despite everything with Sophia, Victoria and William adored Liam. Everyone did.

We just hadn’t loved Sophia—not after the sins we’d accused her of.

"Where’s your mom? I invited her," Victoria asked, straightening, her gaze darting behind us.

"Oh, she’s visiting Grandma Eleanor and Grandpa Alexander," Liam chirped. "She was super excited. They were away last week."

He didn’t notice. But I did.

The way Victoria’s smile fractured. The flicker of pain in her eyes.

It had to gut her—knowing Sophia was building bonds with her birth parents while every bridge to the Sterlings had burned.

She’d hurt Sophia too deeply. And now? Sophia wanted nothing to do with us.

Nothing at all.
###Chapter 147

The moment Sophia stepped into the dimly lit hospital corridor, her pulse quickened.

The sterile scent of antiseptic filled the air, sharp and unforgiving.

Her fingers trembled as she clutched the strap of her purse, her knuckles turning white.

She had been here before—too many times.

But this time was different.

This time, Liam was inside that room.

Her son.

The thought sent a fresh wave of panic crashing through her.

She forced herself to take a deep breath, but it did little to steady her nerves.

The sound of hurried footsteps echoed behind her.

She turned to see Ethan Blackwood striding toward her, his expression unreadable.

His presence was both a comfort and a complication.

"Sophia," he said, his voice low. "You shouldn’t be here."

Her jaw tightened. "He’s my son."

Ethan’s gaze flickered to the closed door before returning to her. "I know. But this isn’t the time."

She shook her head. "I don’t care about your rules. I need to see him."

A tense silence stretched between them.

Then, the door creaked open.

A nurse—Charlotte—stepped out, her face weary. "Mrs. Blackwood?"

Sophia’s breath hitched. "Yes?"

Charlotte hesitated. "He’s asking for you."

Ethan’s hand shot out, gripping Sophia’s arm. "Wait."

She yanked free. "No."

Without another word, she pushed past him and stepped into the room.

The sight that greeted her shattered what little composure she had left.

Liam lay in the hospital bed, pale and fragile, his small frame swallowed by the sterile white sheets.

His eyes—so much like Ethan’s—fluttered open.

"Mom?" His voice was barely a whisper.

Tears blurred her vision as she rushed to his side. "I’m here, sweetheart."

She reached for his hand, but he flinched away.

Her heart stuttered.

"Liam?"

His lower lip trembled. "Why did you leave?"

The question struck like a blade.

She had no answer.

Not one that would make sense to a child.

Not one that would ease the betrayal in his eyes.

Behind her, the door clicked shut.

Ethan had given them privacy.

Or perhaps he simply couldn’t bear to watch.

She swallowed hard. "I never wanted to."

Liam’s gaze dropped to his lap. "Dad said you didn’t love us anymore."

Her breath caught.

Ethan had told him that?

Anger flared, hot and sudden, but she forced it down.

This wasn’t about Ethan.

This was about Liam.

She reached for him again, slower this time. "That’s not true. I love you more than anything."

He didn’t pull away.

But he didn’t respond either.

The silence stretched, heavy and suffocating.

Then, faintly, the sound of monitors beeping filled the room.

A reminder that time was slipping away.

She had so much to say.

But words had never been enough.

Not then.

Not now.

So she did the only thing she could.

She leaned forward and pressed a kiss to his forehead.

"I’m sorry," she whispered.

And for the first time in years, she meant it.

Truly.

Deeply.

But would it be enough?

The door opened again.

Charlotte cleared her throat. "Visiting hours are over."

Sophia straightened, her heart aching.

She didn’t want to go.

But she had no choice.

Not anymore.

She forced a smile for Liam. "I’ll be back tomorrow, okay?"

He didn’t answer.

She turned and walked out, her steps heavy.

Ethan was waiting in the hallway, his arms crossed.

She met his gaze. "We need to talk."

His expression darkened. "Not here."

She nodded. "Your office. One hour."

Without waiting for a response, she walked away.

The hospital doors slid open, revealing the stormy night outside.

Rain lashed against the pavement, mirroring the turmoil inside her.

She had come back for Liam.

But now, she realized, she might lose him all over again.

And this time, it would be her fault.

Entirely.

The only reason I remained in her life was because I was Liam's father—and because I refused to let go. Otherwise, Sophia would have discarded me like she had everyone else.

"Maybe next time," Victoria offered him a sorrowful smile.

She was on the verge of breaking down. Tears shimmered in her eyes, barely contained. Liam, blissfully unaware of the tension, didn’t need to witness his grandmother’s emotional collapse. If he ever discovered the truth—how cruelly Sophia had been treated—he would explode.

Liam’s loyalty to his mother was absolute. If he learned what we’d done, we’d instantly become his enemies. And he wouldn’t hesitate to cut us off.

"Let’s go," I murmured, stepping forward and guiding them inside. "I’m sure the others are waiting."

Victoria excused herself, disappearing toward the bathroom, while Liam and I made our way to the backyard.

I suppressed a groan when I saw the full gathering. Liam darted ahead, leaving me behind.

He greeted everyone—except Isabella. He didn’t even glance in her direction. His dislike for her was blatant, and he made no effort to hide it.

"So glad you finally decided to join us, son," my father said, clapping me on the back.

He knew it annoyed me. He did it anyway.

"Yep," I muttered, already counting down the minutes until this was over.

"You sound thrilled to be here," Sebastian remarked dryly.

I shot him a glare. Unlike everyone else, he didn’t flinch. Being my twin, he was immune to my usual intimidation tactics.

"Come here, Ethan," my mother said, opening her arms. "I’ve missed you."

I wrapped an arm around her waist in a brief hug. "Missed you too."

We pulled apart just as Victoria returned, her eyes red and cheeks blotchy.

Liam was already seated at the table, chatting animatedly with Nathan while piling food onto his plate.

Nathan had invited Amelia, but she’d refused. She wanted nothing to do with people who had hurt Sophia.

Her fierce loyalty to Sophia was straining their relationship. Nathan was terrified of losing her—especially since he had been one of the worst offenders.

"Can we talk, Ethan?" Isabella’s voice cut through my thoughts.

Damn it. I hadn’t even noticed her approach.

"There’s nothing to talk about," I said flatly, turning to face her.

I’d been avoiding her. I was still furious about the things she’d said about Liam. But more than that, I just didn’t want her near me. Not when my mind was consumed with thoughts of Sophia.

I had loved the woman standing before me. I’d cherished her, even when I was married to her sister. I’d been so certain that no one else could ever compare.

All I’d wanted was for her to come back. I’d sworn that if she ever gave me another chance, I’d leave Sophia and build a life with her.

But now?

She’d been back for months, and yet… I felt nothing. The love I’d believed was eternal had vanished. The passion I’d sworn no other woman could inspire had faded.

I was a fool. One moment, I was proclaiming my undying love for Isabella. The next, I couldn’t stand her presence. One moment, I was convinced I despised Sophia. The next, I couldn’t stay away from her.

The two sisters were driving me insane.

"Ethan—"

"What?" I snapped, suddenly suffocated by the weight of it all.

Tears welled in her eyes, but for the first time, I didn’t care. Not like I used to.

Without another word, I turned and walked away.

For years, I’d played the "what if" game. What if I could finally be with the woman I’d always loved? What if we got married, started a family? What if everything had gone the way it was supposed to?

Those questions had haunted me—until Isabella returned. I’d thought it was our second chance.

I’d been wrong.

We were too different now. Even if we’d gotten together years ago, there was no guarantee we would’ve lasted.

She would always hold a piece of my heart as my first love. But it was time to face the truth.

My love for her was dead.

And maybe it had been for a long, long time.
###Chapter 148

The moment Sophia stepped into the dimly lit hospital room, her breath caught.

Liam lay motionless on the bed, his small frame swallowed by white sheets. The steady beep of the heart monitor filled the silence.

She reached out, her fingers trembling as they brushed his pale cheek.

Ethan Blackwood stood in the corner, his jaw clenched. His usual composed demeanor had cracked, revealing raw anguish.

"He hasn’t woken up," he said, voice rough.

Sophia’s chest tightened.

She turned to Dr. Bennett, who stood by the door with a chart in hand. "What happened?"

The doctor sighed. "His vitals are stable, but he’s in a coma. We’re running more tests."

A coma.

The word echoed in Sophia’s mind like a death sentence.

She sank into the chair beside the bed, gripping Liam’s small hand.

Ethan moved closer, his presence a storm of unspoken guilt and fury.

"This wasn’t an accident," he muttered.

Sophia looked up sharply.

His eyes darkened. "Someone did this."

A chill slithered down her spine.

Before she could respond, her phone buzzed.

An unknown number.

She hesitated, then answered.

A distorted voice hissed through the line.

"Did you really think you could escape?"

Her blood turned to ice.

The call disconnected.

Ethan’s gaze locked onto hers. "Who was that?"

Sophia’s fingers tightened around the phone.

"The past," she whispered. "It’s not done with us yet."

Outside the window, the first drops of rain began to fall.

My mind reeled from the shocking realization. I'd always believed my love for Isabella was unshakable. Discovering it wasn't had sent my thoughts and emotions into chaos.

I moved swiftly, dropping onto the bench beside Liam. More than anything, I wanted this nightmare to end. The need to escape clawed at me, my skin prickling with unease.

"What were you talking about with Isabella?" Liam demanded the second I sat down.

The venom in his voice was unmistakable. No one needed an explanation—the woman I'd once vowed to spend my life with was the person he despised most.

This hatred was another reason I'd hesitated about Isabella. How could I be with her when my son loathed her? How could I even consider a future with someone who clearly didn’t care for Liam?

From the things she’d said about him, it was obvious she resented him—whether for being Sophia’s son or for being the reason I'd married her. Maybe both.

"Nothing important," I muttered, lost in my thoughts.

Silence stretched between us until he spoke again. His words made my hands curl into fists.

"I have a best friend now. Just like you and Uncle Sebastian have Uncle Nathan," he announced.

"That’s good."

I wasn’t in the mood for conversation. My mood had darkened, but Liam didn’t take the hint. He kept going.

"His name is Oliver. They moved in next door last week."

I nodded absently. It wasn’t that I didn’t care—my mind was just elsewhere. And at the center of it all was Sophia.

"You know," he paused, mischief glinting in his eyes, "his dad is really good-looking."

That got my attention. I turned to him sharply, catching his smug grin.

"He’s been over to our house. When Oliver and I were playing, Mom and Mr. Lucas were downstairs baking cupcakes! He even promised to help her plant the vegetable garden."

What the hell? Who was this Lucas guy? And why was Sophia letting him into her home when the Slades were still a threat?

Liam continued, smirking like he’d just unleashed a storm inside me.

"He made her laugh. A lot. When Oliver and I came down for dinner, they were standing really close while setting the table."

Every word fueled my fury. My jaw clenched so tight it ached. I barely held back from snapping at my own son. My pulse roared in my ears, anger crashing over me in waves.

"I was worried about Mom when you married Isabella," Liam said, "but now that Lucas is here, you can go ahead. I still don’t like her, but you can marry her, and Mom can marry Lucas. Oliver would be my brother, so that’s a bonus."

Then, with a devilish grin, he delivered the final blow.

"Maybe Oliver and I can get more siblings. We’ll have to ask them first, but I’m sure they’ll agree."

That was it. I snapped.

"Liam!" I slammed my hand on the picnic table, the crack echoing across the yard.

Everyone turned to stare. Confusion painted their faces. I’d never once raised my voice at Liam before.

"What?" he asked innocently, as if he hadn’t just lit a fire inside me.

Instead of cowering, he stood, flashed me a triumphant smirk, and walked away—straight toward Victoria and my mother.

"What the hell was that about?" Sebastian asked, dropping onto the bench beside me. Nathan joined us seconds later.

I was still seething. The thought of another man playing house with Sophia—and Liam actually liking him—was unbearable.

No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t shake the image of Sophia laughing with another man, their hands brushing as they set the table. It tore at me in ways I didn’t understand.

And I hated it.
###Chapter 149

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the bedroom floor. Sophia stretched lazily, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her.

Ethan had already left.

Again.

She sighed, pushing herself up. The scent of his cologne lingered faintly on the pillow, a bittersweet reminder of his presence.

Downstairs, Liam was already at the table, shoveling cereal into his mouth with the enthusiasm only a child could muster. Gabriella, his nanny, gave Sophia a knowing smile.

"Morning, Ms. Blackwood."

"Morning," Sophia murmured, reaching for the coffee pot.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Daniel.

"Good morning. Just checking in."

Her fingers hovered over the screen. She should reply. But something held her back.

The doorbell rang.

Sophia frowned. It was too early for visitors.

She opened the door to find a courier holding a sleek black envelope.

"For you, ma'am."

Her name was written in elegant silver script. No return address.

A prickle of unease ran down her spine.

Inside, the envelope contained a single sheet of paper.

"You should have stayed gone."

The words sent a chill through her.

Liam’s laughter echoed from the kitchen, blissfully unaware.

But Sophia knew.

This wasn’t over.

Not even close.

She never smiled around me. Not genuinely. If she did, it was distant, like ice. But hearing that someone else could make her laugh? That burned like hell.

"So, what did Liam say to piss you off?" Nathan asked, studying me with raised brows.

"Nothing important," I muttered through clenched teeth. "Just that their new neighbor is cozying up in Sophia’s house, making her laugh like I never could."

Nathan and Sebastian exchanged glances before bursting into laughter. I didn’t care. My blood was boiling.

I wanted to hit something—hard. The image of another man standing where I should be, earning her smiles, her laughter—it made me see red.

A primal part of me roared that she was mine. That no one else had the right to be near her.

The thought shocked me. I’d never considered Sophia as mine. She was just… Sophia. The woman who’d turned my life upside down.

"Liam’s obviously trying to get under your skin," Sebastian said once their laughter faded. "He’s not subtle about wanting you two back together. Your reaction just proved him right—you still care. A lot."

I shot him a glare. I wanted to deny it, but I couldn’t. The truth? I was jealous. Brutally, irrationally jealous.

I wanted Sophia’s smiles. Her laughter. I wanted to be the one setting the damn table in her kitchen, helping her plant that ridiculous vegetable garden she always talked about.

The realization hit me like a punch. I was Ethan Blackwood—I didn’t kneel for anyone. Yet here I was, ready to get my hands dirty just to be near her.

Since when?

Since fucking when did I start wanting this?

"Do you want her back?" Nathan asked, serious now.

The question threw me. I didn’t have an answer. How could I explain this mess in my chest? The emotions were chaos, a storm I couldn’t control.

Why now? Why not years ago?

The questions pounded in my skull, relentless. And I had no answers.

With a rough exhale, I stood, ignoring the curious stares from my parents, Liam’s smug smirk, and Victoria’s confusion.

I needed air. Space. A damn minute to think.

But the house wasn’t empty.

Isabella sat alone in the living room. The second she saw me, she rushed over.

"Ethan, please," she begged. "Talk to me. Tell me how to fix this."

I hated hurting her. But stringing her along would be worse.

Running a hand through my hair, I sighed. "There’s nothing to fix, Isabella. It’s over. We both need to accept that."

Her face shattered. "Are you saying you don’t love me? That you love Sophia instead?"

Just like with Nathan and Sebastian, I walked away.

But as night fell, the question haunted me.

If I didn’t love Isabella… did that mean I was still in love with my ex-wife?
###Chapter 150

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the bedroom floor. Sophia stretched lazily, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her.

Ethan had already left.

Again.

She sighed, sitting up and running a hand through her tousled hair. The scent of his cologne lingered faintly on the sheets, a bittersweet reminder of his presence.

Downstairs, Liam was already at the breakfast table, shoveling cereal into his mouth with the enthusiasm only a child could muster. Gabriella, his ever-patient nanny, stood nearby, refilling his juice.

"Morning, Mom!" Liam grinned, milk dribbling down his chin.

Sophia chuckled, pressing a kiss to his forehead. "Morning, sweetheart. Slow down before you choke."

The doorbell rang.

Gabriella moved to answer it, returning moments later with a puzzled expression. "A package for you, ma'am."

Sophia frowned. She hadn’t ordered anything.

The box was small, wrapped in plain brown paper with no return address. A prickle of unease crawled up her spine as she carefully peeled back the tape.

Inside lay a single black rose.

And a note.

"Did you really think it was over?"

Her breath hitched. The handwriting was unmistakable.

Damien Slade.

The phone in her pocket buzzed, startling her. A text from Daniel.

"We need to talk. It’s urgent."

Sophia’s fingers trembled as she typed a reply.

"What’s wrong?"

His response was immediate.

"He’s out."

The world tilted.

Ethan.

He was free.

And he was coming for her.

The weekend had been perfect. Nothing extraordinary happened, but I cherished every moment with Alexander and Eleanor.

They were everything I had ever wished my biological parents could have been—warm, nurturing, and present. Unlike Victoria and William, who had only ever shown affection to Isabella and Nathan.

Even Sebastian and Ethan Blackwood received more kindness from them than I ever did, despite their claims that I was their daughter.

The more time I spent with Alexander and Eleanor, the deeper my love for them grew. The easier it became to accept them as my true parents. Being around them made me understand why Daniel adored them so much—why he spoke of them with such reverence. They were extraordinary, and no one needed convincing of that.

"Where the hell is she?" Natalie snapped, pulling me from my thoughts.

We were at a café, waiting for Scarlett, who, as usual, was late. The woman worked as a secretary, yet she had zero concept of punctuality.

"She’ll be here. Probably just stuck in traffic," I mumbled around a bite of my blueberry muffin.

My pregnancy cravings had officially taken over. Right now, all I wanted were muffins and cupcakes. I ate them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Everything else tasted like cardboard.

"We agreed to meet at two," Natalie grumbled, irritation twisting her elegant features.

I chuckled at her frustration. "You’ll learn quickly that Scarlett is never on time. The sooner you accept it, the less stress you’ll have."

She fumed silently, and I knew why. Natalie hated waiting. She was the type who’d rather arrive an hour early than a minute late.

As she stewed, I devoured another muffin. I was constantly hungry.

With Liam, my first pregnancy had been brutal. No anti-nausea medication worked, and I didn’t get relief until I was six months along.

That’s why Ethan’s abandonment had cut so deep. While I was barely surviving, he was too busy mourning Isabella to care that I was losing weight, that our baby’s health was at risk.

I’d been hospitalized multiple times because my doctor feared for Liam and me.

I understood his grief, but seriously? Did that excuse neglecting his unborn child?

Shoving the bitterness aside, I focused on Natalie. She was tapping her foot impatiently.

"What’s wrong?" I finally asked when the silence became unbearable.

"I have a business proposal for you and Scarlett, but since she’s still not here, I’ll just tell you. It’s driving me crazy," she admitted after a pause.

"Okay…?"

"It’s unconventional. Not the kind of venture people in our social circles usually consider."

That piqued my interest. If Natalie thought it was unconventional, it had to be something bold.

"Go on."

"I want us to start a sex toy company," she announced, dead serious.

I choked on my muffin. Surely, I’d misheard.

"Excuse me?" I sputtered.

"A sex toy company," she repeated. "Think about it. The market is booming. Seventy percent of women own at least one, single or not. Even men are embracing them to spice things up."

I gaped at her, speechless.

"What’s got Sophia so shocked?" Scarlett’s voice cut in as she slid into the seat beside us.

I hadn’t even noticed her arrival. That’s how stunned I was.

She glanced between us. "What did I miss?"

"Natalie just suggested we start a sex toy business," I said weakly.

I expected shock. Instead, Scarlett’s eyes lit up.

"That’s brilliant!" she squealed.

"Are you both insane?" I demanded, but they ignored me.

"It’s genius. What woman doesn’t own at least one?" Natalie challenged.

"Me," I admitted.

They both turned to stare at me like I’d grown a second head.

"You don’t?" Scarlett gasped.

"Nope. Never have."

"You’re missing out," Natalie said bluntly.

I’d considered it once, but my sex life with Ethan hadn’t exactly been… experimental. For him, it was about release. For me, it was about desperately trying to bridge the emotional gap between us.

"I say we do it. Like Natalie said, it’s profitable. We just need a unique angle," Scarlett declared.

"Then it’s settled. I’ll draft a proposal and email you both once I’ve finalized everything," Natalie said, finally looking satisfied.

I sat there, still reeling, as they excitedly brainstormed branding ideas.

What had I just agreed to?
###Chapter 151

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the bedroom floor. Sophia stretched lazily, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her.

Ethan had already left.

Again.

She sighed, pushing back the silk sheets. The scent of his cologne lingered faintly on the pillow, a cruel reminder of his absence.

Downstairs, Liam was already at the breakfast table, his small hands wrapped around a mug of hot chocolate. Gabriella, his nanny, stood nearby, slicing fresh fruit.

"Morning, Mom," Liam chirped, his smile bright.

Sophia forced a smile in return. "Morning, sweetheart."

She poured herself a cup of coffee, the bitter taste grounding her. The house was too quiet. Too empty.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Daniel.

"Still on for lunch today?"

She hesitated.

Part of her wanted to say no. To retreat into the safety of solitude. But another part—the part that craved warmth, connection—whispered otherwise.

"Yes. See you at noon."

She set the phone down, her fingers trembling slightly.

Was she making a mistake?

The doorbell rang.

Gabriella moved to answer it, but Sophia waved her off. "I'll get it."

She opened the door to find Natalie standing there, her arms crossed, expression unreadable.

"We need to talk," Natalie said.

Sophia's stomach twisted. "About what?"

Natalie stepped inside, lowering her voice. "It's about Ethan."

Sophia's breath hitched.

"What about him?"

Natalie hesitated, then sighed. "He’s been meeting with Vanessa. Frequently."

Sophia’s grip on the door tightened.

Vanessa.

The woman who had humiliated her at the charity gala. The woman who had once been Ethan’s secretary—and possibly more.

Her vision blurred.

Was history repeating itself?

Liam’s laughter echoed from the kitchen, a stark contrast to the storm brewing inside her.

She had to know the truth.

No matter how much it hurt.

"Hold up, I never agreed to this insane plan!"

Scarlett completely ignores my protest. "We need thorough market research. Since Sophia has zero experience with adult toys, she should purchase all the premium brands and test them. Her fresh perspective will help us identify flaws and improve our own designs."

Natalie nods eagerly, her grin widening. I could practically see the excitement radiating off her. Meanwhile, I felt like a lab rat about to be experimented on.

"Do I get any say in this?" I snap, irritation creeping into my voice.

"Not really. We're about to make you filthy rich, so..." Scarlett trails off with a dismissive wave.

"You do realize I’m already loaded, right?"

She shrugs, brushing me off. "Doesn’t matter. Weren’t you the one complaining about needing a new challenge? Well, here it is. It’ll keep you entertained without exhausting you."

I exhale sharply, considering it. How bad could it really be?

"Fine," I mutter in defeat.

They both squeal, crushing me in a suffocating hug. Their enthusiasm is contagious, and for the first time in ages, I feel a spark of excitement. Maybe this will bring some color back into my dull life.

Once we pull apart, Scarlett’s expression turns serious. "Now that that’s settled, I have a question for you, Sophia."

I raise a brow. "Go ahead."

"Who’s Lucas?"

The question catches me off guard. I haven’t mentioned Lucas to them, and after that one encounter, I haven’t seen him again. Hunter drops by almost daily, but his father? Nowhere in sight.

"He’s my new neighbor. How do you know about him?"

"Tristan told me," she says, and my frown deepens. How does Tristan know Lucas?

"Apparently, at the gathering, Liam brought him up. And not just casually—he told Ethan that Lucas made you happy and he wouldn’t mind if you two got married and gave him and Lucas more siblings. Tristan said Ethan nearly lost it."

"Seriously?" Natalie gasps, eyes wide.

"Yep. Tristan said he was so jealous he almost smashed the table in half," Scarlett adds with a smirk.

I burst out laughing so hard my stomach aches.

This is ridiculous. Liam trying to make Ethan jealous? And Ethan actually getting jealous? That’s beyond absurd. If there’s one man who wouldn’t care if I slept with every guy in the city, it’s Ethan Blackwood.

"Tell me this is a joke," I wheeze once I catch my breath.

It has to be. The only person Ethan has ever been jealous over is Isabella. Not me. Never me.

"It’s not. Tristan’s even questioning Ethan’s feelings toward you now," Scarlett insists.

"Why is that so hard to believe?" Natalie asks curiously.

"Because I know him. Jealousy isn’t in his vocabulary. He was probably just pissed that Liam keeps pushing us back together." I turn to Scarlett. "And tell Tristan there’s nothing going on. When Isabella returned, he asked me not to interfere with their 'happily ever after,' and I haven’t."

"I don’t think that’s it," Scarlett murmurs. "I think he’s starting to realize he might’ve been wrong about you and Ethan. That maybe Ethan does have feelings for you."

I remember Tristan’s warning at the hospital after Isabella came back. He was terrified I’d ruin their fairytale ending.

"The only thing Ethan Blackwood has ever felt for me is hatred. Nothing will convince me otherwise. This whole conversation is insane. You don’t despise someone for nine years and suddenly develop feelings. That’s not how it works."

"Unless the feelings were always there, and he just refused to acknowledge them," Natalie suggests.

I shake my head, frustration bubbling up. "Scarlett—"

"No. Drop it. I don’t want to hear another word about Ethan, okay? Even if—magically—he developed feelings for me, don’t you think it’s too late now?"

Scarlett stays silent. Natalie stares at the table. The mood plummets, and suddenly, all I want is to go home and forget this entire conversation.

Why won’t they let this go? Why insist on something that doesn’t exist? If they truly believe this nonsense, they’re delusional. I know Ethan. And I know there’s nothing but resentment in his heart for me.

I shake my head, forcing the thoughts away. My focus is on my kids, my foundation, and this absurd new business venture.

Ethan is in the past. And that’s where he’ll stay. Nothing will ever change that.
###Chapter 152

The moment Sophia stepped into the penthouse, she knew something was wrong.

The air was thick with tension, the kind that made her skin prickle.

Liam wasn’t in his room.

His bed was neatly made, his toys untouched.

Her heart hammered against her ribs as she rushed to Ethan’s study.

The door was slightly ajar.

She pushed it open, her breath catching in her throat.

Ethan stood by the window, his back rigid, his phone pressed to his ear.

His voice was low, dangerous.

“Find him. Now.”

Sophia’s stomach twisted.

“What’s going on?” she demanded.

Ethan turned, his eyes dark with fury.

“Liam’s missing.”

The words hit her like a physical blow.

Her knees nearly buckled.

“What do you mean, missing?”

Ethan’s jaw clenched.

“He was supposed to be at his piano lesson. The instructor never showed. The driver said someone else picked him up.”

Sophia’s blood ran cold.

“Who?”

Ethan’s grip on the phone tightened.

“Someone claiming to be from the school.”

Her mind raced.

This wasn’t an accident.

Someone had taken their son.

And she had a terrible feeling she knew who.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket.

An unknown number.

Her fingers trembled as she answered.

A familiar, chilling voice filled her ear.

“Hello, Sophia. Miss me?”

Her breath stopped.

It was him.

The man who had haunted her nightmares.

And he had Liam.

My fingers tap nervously against the desk as Harrison flips through the business proposal Natalie sent over.

I have to give her credit—the woman works at lightning speed. Less than twenty-four hours since we discussed the idea, and she already had a full proposal ready.

Either she’s incredibly efficient, or she had this drafted long before and was just waiting for Scarlett and me to agree.

Harrison’s expression is unreadable. He’s been more than just my lawyer since my first million—he’s been my most trusted advisor. I never enter a business venture without his approval.

And he’s never been wrong.

Every venture he endorsed thrived. Every one he warned me against collapsed. His opinion isn’t just important—it’s vital.

“Well?” I finally ask when the silence stretches too long.

He scans the document one last time before looking up.

“It’s a solid concept. The potential is undeniable.”

I know him too well. There’s a but hanging in the air. His hesitation is palpable.

“What’s the catch?” I press, my pulse quickening.

He studies me, weighing his words carefully. The longer he stays silent, the tighter my chest feels.

“Just say it, Harrison.”

“It’s… unconventional,” he finally admits.

“I know that.”

“And there’s another factor.” He hesitates. “Have you considered how this might impact your role at Hope Foundation?”

My smile fades. He notices and backtracks quickly.

“I’m not saying it’s a bad idea. It’s brilliant, actually. But as the founder of a children’s charity, you have a reputation to uphold. If word gets out that you’re co-owning a sex toy company—”

I drop my gaze to the desk.

Since I had extra space in the house, I converted one room into a home office. Now, surrounded by soft lighting and the faint scent of lavender, his words sink in.

He’s right.

I’m the face of an organization dedicated to children. Associating with this kind of business could be seen as morally conflicting.

A defeated sigh escapes me. At first, I’d been hesitant, but the excitement had grown. The idea of building something bold with friends had been exhilarating.

“You’re right,” I murmur. “The socialites who donate would pull their funding the second they find out.”

He nods. Silence stretches between us.

My mind races, trying to figure out how to break this to Natalie and Scarlett. They’ll be disappointed, but they’ll understand. That’s what friends do.

“This is a huge opportunity,” Harrison says, pulling me from my thoughts. “I don’t want you to lose it. Would they consider having you as a silent partner?”

A spark of hope flickers in my chest.

I’ve been a silent investor before—owning shares, advising on major decisions, but remaining anonymous. Only the CEOs and boards ever knew.

“That could work,” I say slowly, a smile tugging at my lips. “I’ll talk to them, but I doubt they’ll object.”

“Good.” He stands. “Let me know once you’ve spoken with them. I’ll draft the necessary documents.”

“Thank you, Harrison. Really.”

He smirks. “Don’t thank me. You pay me an obscene amount to solve your problems.”

I laugh as he heads for the door.

“See you, Sophia.”

“See you.”

The moment he’s gone, I grab my phone. I’ll call Scarlett first, then Natalie.

She answers on the first ring.

“Scarlett, I’ve got—”

“I’m so sorry, Sophia,” she blurts before I can finish.

Her voice is thick with regret, so heavy it makes my chest ache.

I frown. “What are you talking about? What do you have to apologize for?”

Staring blankly at the opposite wall, I wrack my brain. We haven’t fought. She hasn’t done anything that would require forgiveness.

So why does she sound like she’s about to cry?
###Chapter 153

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the bedroom floor. Sophia stretched beneath the silk sheets, her body still humming from the intensity of last night.

Ethan Blackwood’s side of the bed was empty, but the lingering warmth suggested he hadn’t been gone long.

She exhaled, running a hand through her tousled hair.

Memories of their argument resurfaced—sharp words, accusations, the way his jaw had clenched when she’d thrown his past in his face.

Then, the way he’d silenced her with a kiss that burned hotter than their anger.

A knock at the door startled her.

“Come in,” she called, pulling the sheet higher.

Liam poked his head in, his dark eyes hesitant. “Mom? Are you okay?”

Sophia softened. “I’m fine, sweetheart. Just… thinking.”

He shuffled inside, clutching a sketchbook. “Dad left early. He looked mad.”

She sighed. “We had a disagreement. But it’s nothing for you to worry about.”

Liam frowned, unconvinced. “You always say that.”

Before she could respond, her phone buzzed. A message from Daniel Carter lit up the screen.

We need to talk. It’s urgent.

Her stomach twisted.

Daniel had been a complication she hadn’t anticipated—a man who made her question everything.

And now, with Ethan’s temper already on edge, this couldn’t be worse timing.

Liam tilted his head. “Mom?”

She forced a smile. “Just work stuff. Go get ready for school, okay?”

Once he left, she stared at the message, her thumb hovering over the screen.

A part of her wanted to ignore it.

But the other part—the reckless, curious part—whispered that maybe Daniel held answers she wasn’t ready to face.

Downstairs, the front door slammed.

Ethan was home.

And from the sound of his footsteps, he wasn’t in the mood for more lies.

"For pushing. I keep pushing the issue about Ethan not realizing how much it’s hurting you. I just want you to be happy, and part of me still believes Ethan could be that happiness. You’ve loved him for so long—it’s hard to imagine all of it just disappearing."

"Amelia…" She was on a roll, not giving me a chance to interrupt.

"I want you to have a shot at happiness. You told me you used to wish Ethan would feel something for you. Now that it seems he does, you don’t believe it, and you’re fighting it. I don’t understand."

I sighed. Again?

I was exhausted from hearing about Ethan and his so-called feelings. Every mention grated on my nerves. Ethan had no place in my life anymore, and neither did his emotions. He could take them and shove them where the sun didn’t shine, for all I cared.

"I’ll explain this once, and then I never want to hear about it again," I said, steadying my breath before continuing.

"I loved Ethan. A part of me probably always will. You don’t just get over that kind of love—but it can be poisoned by the actions of the one you love. Ethan hurt me in ways that turned my love into something toxic. A slow-acting poison, eating away at me from the inside. That love became too painful, so to protect what little of myself I had left, I buried it so deep it can never be unearthed again."

My chest ached as I spoke. The love was still there, perhaps, but buried beneath years of his cruelty. The pain he caused outweighed the love I once felt.

He never laid a hand on me, but sometimes I wished he had. Physical wounds heal. The ones inflicted on the heart and soul? Those fester.

"Ethan hurt me in ways I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. Burying that love was the only way I survived the storm that was him."

I heard her quiet sobs. It hurt, but she needed to understand.

"I’m sorry, Sophia. I didn’t mean to dredge up painful memories."

"I know, Amelia. And I know you want me to be happy. But Ethan isn’t the answer. If we were never happy in nine years of marriage, what makes you think we’d be happy now?"

Like I kept telling her, I doubted Ethan felt anything for me except resentment. And even if, by some miracle, he did—too much had happened. There was no going back.

"I’m really sorry. I promise I won’t bring it up again."

I exhaled in relief.

"Thank you. And besides, did you forget? I swore off men. Love isn’t for me. History has proven I have terrible taste." I chuckled.

She let out a small laugh. She’d had a field day when I declared myself done with men.

"Yeah, I remember. I guess the business idea came at the perfect time. Free sex toys for you." This time, her laugh was fuller, and I was glad to pull her out of her melancholy.

"Speaking of which…"

I filled her in on everything we’d discussed with the lawyer—why I had to be a silent partner. Just as I’d expected, she was on board.

"I get it. No problem. I’m sure Natalie will understand too."

"I’ll talk to her later."

"Which reminds me—did you buy from the list we sent you?" she asked after a pause.

"I was planning to go after the meeting with the lawyer."

"Well, get your butt moving. Your feedback is crucial." She paused as someone spoke to her in the background. "I have to go. Impromptu meeting."

"No worries. Have a good day."

"You too. And let me know once you’ve got the toys."

We hung up.

I finished my chores, showered, got ready, and left—straight to the mall. It didn’t take long to get there.

After parking, I headed inside, nerves twisting my stomach. Excited, yet guilty, like I was doing something illicit. Like everyone would judge me for stepping into a sex shop, let alone buying from one.

I followed the directions to Natalie’s favorite store, relieved to find it tucked away in a discreet corner.

I hesitated outside, debating whether to go in—when his unmistakable voice cut through my thoughts.

"Sophia?"

Oh, hell no.

What the hell was he doing here?
###Chapter 154

The moment Sophia stepped into the dimly lit hospital room, her breath caught in her throat.

Liam lay motionless on the bed, his small frame swallowed by the sterile white sheets.

The rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor was the only sound in the suffocating silence.

She reached out, her fingers trembling as they brushed against his cold hand.

This is all my fault.

The thought clawed at her chest, relentless and unforgiving.

Footsteps echoed behind her, heavy and deliberate.

She didn’t need to turn to know who it was.

Ethan Blackwood’s presence was like a storm rolling in—dark, inevitable, and impossible to ignore.

"You shouldn’t be here," he said, his voice low and rough with exhaustion.

Sophia clenched her jaw.

"I have every right to be here."

Ethan’s gaze burned into her, a silent challenge.

The air between them crackled with tension, thick enough to choke on.

Then, a weak voice cut through the silence.

"Mom?"

Sophia’s heart shattered all over again.

Liam’s eyes fluttered open, glassy with pain but unmistakably aware.

She dropped to her knees beside the bed, clutching his hand like a lifeline.

"I’m here, baby. I’m right here."

Ethan exhaled sharply, his fists tightening at his sides.

The door creaked open again.

Daniel Carter stepped inside, his police badge glinting under the harsh fluorescent lights.

His eyes flickered between Sophia and Ethan, assessing the situation with practiced calm.

"We need to talk," he said, his tone leaving no room for argument.

Sophia hesitated, torn between staying with Liam and facing whatever new nightmare awaited her.

Liam squeezed her hand weakly.

"Go," he whispered. "I’ll be okay."

Her throat tightened.

She pressed a kiss to his forehead before standing, her legs unsteady beneath her.

As she followed Daniel out, she could feel Ethan’s gaze boring into her back.

A silent promise—or a threat.

She wasn’t sure which.

And right now, she didn’t care.

Because one thing was certain.

This wasn’t over.

Not even close.

I whirl around, my breath catching in my throat.

Ethan Blackwood stands there, his piercing gaze locked onto me.

Just my luck.

"Ethan?" My voice comes out sharper than intended. "What the hell are you doing here?"

Of all the places, of all the moments—why here? Why now?

I’m standing right in front of Passion & Desire, its neon sign flashing provocatively, the window display leaving absolutely nothing to the imagination.

This is officially the most humiliating moment of my life.

He tilts his head, amusement flickering in his eyes. "I could ask you the same thing."

Heat floods my cheeks. There’s no way to spin this. No clever lie that could erase the fact that I’m standing in front of a sex shop.

I glance back at the store, then at him, nerves twisting in my stomach.

"I was just… shopping for maternity clothes," I blurt. "And baby stuff."

His eyebrow arches. "In that store? Unless you’re looking for something very specific, I don’t think they carry onesies."

The smirk on his lips tells me he’s enjoying this.

I don’t dignify that with a response. Instead, I pivot on my heel and march away.

But of course, he follows.

"I didn’t peg you as the type to use toys," he muses, falling into step beside me.

I stop dead in my tracks.

What the actual hell?

"First of all," I snap, whirling on him, "you don’t know anything about me. You never did, because you were too busy acting like I was beneath you. And second—" I lower my voice, furious. "There’s nothing wrong with a woman taking care of her own needs. So back the hell off."

His eyes darken, but I don’t wait for a reply. I speed-walk away, my pulse roaring in my ears.

The audacity of this man.

"Sophia."

I ignore him.

"Sophia."

I stop, glaring. "What?"

He nods toward a store a few feet away. "There’s a maternity shop."

I grit my teeth.

Fine. I do actually need to shop for baby things.

Grudgingly, I stomp toward the store—only to spin around when I realize he’s still following.

"What are you doing?"

"Helping you shop."

"I didn’t ask for your help."

He steps into my space, so close I can feel the heat radiating off him. "Too bad. I’m staying. And you’re going to try on every damn outfit until you find what you need."

My jaw drops.

Before I can unleash the fury bubbling inside me, a cheerful voice interrupts.

"Hi there! Can I help you two?"

Ethan answers before I can.

"My wife needs maternity clothes."

Wife?!

I nearly choke.

We are divorced.

This man has officially lost his mind.
###Chapter 155

The moment Sophia stepped into the dimly lit corridor of the abandoned warehouse, her pulse spiked.

The air smelled of damp concrete and rusted metal.

Every instinct screamed at her to turn back, but she couldn’t—not when Liam’s life was on the line.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket.

A single message from an unknown number: "You’re late."

Sophia clenched her jaw.

She had followed every instruction—no police, no backup, no hesitation.

Yet, the game had already changed.

Footsteps echoed ahead.

A shadow shifted in the darkness.

Then, a familiar voice slithered through the silence.

"Did you really think it would be that easy?"

Sophia froze.

That voice—she knew it.

But it couldn’t be.

Not after all this time.

The figure stepped into the flickering light.

Her breath hitched.

It was him.

The man she had buried years ago.

Ethan Blackwood smirked, his cold eyes locking onto hers.

"Surprise, darling."

Sophia’s hands trembled.

This wasn’t part of the plan.

This wasn’t possible.

Yet here he stood, alive and breathing.

And behind him—

Liam, bound and gagged, his terrified gaze meeting hers.

Sophia’s heart shattered.

Ethan tilted his head, savoring her shock.

"Now," he murmured, "let’s talk about what you owe me."

The walls seemed to close in.

She had walked into a trap.

And this time, there was no escape.

The shop assistant beams at us, gesturing toward the back. "Right this way. I'm Genevieve, and we just got in some stunning maternity exclusives I think your wife will adore."

Before I can correct her assumption, Ethan grabs my wrist and tugs me along like an obedient pet, trailing behind Genevieve into the boutique.

She seats us on a plush velvet sofa before disappearing. The moment she's gone, I whirl on Ethan, fury simmering beneath my skin.

"What the hell was that?" I hiss, my voice trembling with barely restrained rage.

He leans back, the picture of indifference, before lazily countering, "What was what?"

"Don't play stupid!" My nails dig into my palms. "Since when am I your wife? Or did you conveniently forget we're divorced? Or that you're dating Isabella now?"

"Here we are!" Genevieve chirps, reappearing with an armful of garments.

I glare at the poor woman, my irritation misplaced but uncontrollable—Ethan had lit the fuse, and now everything was catching fire.

"How about this one first?" She holds up an elegant maxi dress, the fabric shimmering under the boutique lights.

Under normal circumstances, I would’ve marveled at how gorgeous it was. But right now? I was too busy trying not to combust.

"Go try it on," Ethan orders, completely unfazed by the tension thickening the air.

Snatching the dress, I storm toward the fitting rooms. If he thought I was going to model for him like some obedient doll, he had another thing coming.

Inside, I strip out of my clothes and slip into the dress. The second I catch my reflection, my anger evaporates.

Damn.

The dress hugged every curve perfectly, accentuating my growing bump in a way that made me feel radiant. Decision made—I was buying it.

Genevieve hands me a sundress next, and just like the first, it fits like a dream. Their maternity line was flawless, designed to make expectant women feel like goddesses.

I’m about to try on a pair of jeans when the door creaks open.

The shift in energy tells me instantly—it’s not Genevieve.

I freeze, locking eyes with Ethan in the mirror. He’s holding a sapphire-blue blouse, his gaze darkening as it trails over me.

"What the hell, Ethan?" I whisper-yell, twisting to face him while desperately trying to cover myself. My bra barely contained my fuller chest—another reminder I needed proper maternity lingerie.

He doesn’t speak. His eyes roam over me like a physical touch, slow and deliberate, making my skin prickle.

Grabbing the nearest dress, I use it as a shield.

Then he drops the blouse.

And steps forward.

Before I can react, he cages me between his body and the mirror, one hand braced beside my head. My breath hitches, panic fluttering in my chest.

His fingers trace my lips, then my throat, before dipping lower.

"They’re fuller than I remember," he murmurs, voice rough with something I refuse to name.

"Back off," I demand weakly.

Ignoring me, his hand drifts downward, pushing the dress aside to press against my bump.

I stop breathing.

His doesn’t.

When our eyes meet, I see it—undeniable, blazing hunger. The kind he’d never directed at me before.

My mind short-circuits.

His head dips.

I shove him back before his lips can claim mine.

The force snaps him out of whatever trance he was in. He blinks, shaking his head as if clearing fog.

I’m panting, my thoughts a chaotic whirlwind.

"Sophia—" he starts, voice strained.

"Not another word," I snarl, yanking my clothes on and bolting past him.

I loved the clothes.

But I’d be damned before spending another second near him.

Minutes later, I’m in my car, speeding away from the mall. My hands grip the wheel, knuckles white.

What the hell was that?

Ethan had never looked at me like that.

So why did it seem like he wanted nothing more than to take me right there against the mirror?
###Chapter 156

The moment Sophia stepped into the dimly lit hospital corridor, her pulse quickened.

The sterile scent of antiseptic filled her nostrils, sharp and unforgiving.

Her fingers trembled as she clutched the strap of her purse, her knuckles turning white.

Liam.

Just the thought of her son lying unconscious in that hospital bed made her stomach twist.

She rounded the corner and nearly collided with Ethan Blackwood.

His dark eyes were stormy, jaw clenched tight.

"You're late," he bit out, voice low and rough.

Sophia swallowed hard. "Traffic was—"

"I don’t care." He cut her off, stepping closer. "He’s been asking for you."

Her breath hitched.

Before she could respond, a nurse—Charlotte—emerged from Liam’s room, her expression unreadable.

"Mrs. Blackwood," she said softly. "He’s awake."

Sophia didn’t wait.

She pushed past Ethan, her heels clicking against the linoleum as she rushed inside.

Liam lay propped up against the pillows, his small face pale but alert.

"Mom?" His voice was weak, but it was his voice.

Tears blurred her vision as she hurried to his side, cupping his face in her hands.

"I’m here, baby. I’m right here."

Behind her, she felt Ethan’s presence like a shadow, heavy and unyielding.

She didn’t turn.

Not when Liam’s fingers curled around hers, his grip fragile but determined.

Not when he whispered, "I had a bad dream."

And certainly not when Ethan’s voice, cold and measured, cut through the moment.

"We need to talk."

Sophia stiffened.

She knew that tone.

It never meant anything good.

Damn it!

My eyes track Sophia's frantic escape from the boutique. Every muscle in my body tenses with the urge to chase after her, but I know I've crossed a line. A fucking massive one.

The terror in her gaze should've snapped me out of it. But I wasn't just entranced—I was consumed. The second I saw her nearly bare skin, my brain short-circuited.

I hadn’t even registered moving until she shoved me away. Until I realized I’d backed her into that corner like some starved predator.

She was my wife. Ex-wife, technically. Yet I’d seen her naked a hundred times before without losing control like this. Something about today—the way the lace clung to her curves, the hitch in her breath when our eyes locked—it unraveled me.

Our sex life had been… functional. But I’d always held part of myself back. Back then, my heart still belonged to Isabella. Every time I touched Sophia, guilt curdled in my stomach. The first year of our marriage? I’d drown it in whiskey afterward, disgusted with myself. Eventually, I learned to compartmentalize. To take what my body needed while locking the shame away.

I never cheated. Not once. My parents’ toxic marriage had branded fidelity into my bones. Even when temptation whispered, I walked away.

Now?

Now I’m gripping my hair so hard my scalp burns. The ferocity of my desire minutes ago nearly dropped me to my knees.

Her body—Christ—those sinful thighs, the dip of her waist… I can still taste the fantasy of pushing aside that scrap of lace and—

Fuck.

I’m rock-hard just remembering. Harder than I’ve ever been in my goddamn life. And it terrifies me.

Snarling, I bolt from the dressing room. I need air. Need to outrun the hunger still clawing at my veins.

Malls aren’t my scene—I have tailors for that. But Rosalind ordered some toy for Liam online, insisted I collect it.

Then I spotted Sophia.

Parked near the exit, I caught her fidgeting by the storefront. Nervous. Secretive. Curiosity hooked me. Now? Now I wish I’d driven straight past.

The car door slams as I peel out of the lot. Parents’ house. Booze. That’s the plan.

I make record time. Snatch the toy from the passenger seat. My jaw aches from clenching it.

“Finally.” Rosalind glances up from her tablet. “Did you get the—”

I thrust the package at her.

Mothers always know.

“Ethan.” Her voice sharpens. “What’s wrong?”

For one reckless second, I consider confessing. How do I say it? That the woman we vilified for years now haunts my every thought? That if Sophia hadn’t shoved me off, I’d have taken her right there against the mirror? That I’d have carried her home and spent hours making up for every time I held back?

“Is this about the article?” she interrupts.

“What article?”

She taps her screen, then hands it over. My vision tunnels on the headline:

[ETHAN BLACKWOOD SPOTTED WITH EX-WIFE SOPHIA STERLING AT LUXURY BABY STORE! RECONCILING FOR BABY #2? INSIDERS CLAIM SHE’S ALREADY PREGNANT—BUT HOW, WHEN THEY DIVORCED MONTHS AGO?]

The phone creaks in my grip. Only four people knew about that pregnancy.

Sophia’s going to lose it.

I’m dialing my PR team before the screen goes dark.
###Chapter 157

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the hospital corridor as Sophia clutched Liam’s small hand tightly. His fingers trembled slightly, mirroring the unease in her own chest.

She forced a reassuring smile. "It’s going to be okay, sweetheart."

Liam nodded, but his wide eyes remained fixed on the sterile white doors ahead. Behind them lay the room where Ethan Blackwood lay unconscious, his injuries severe.

Isabella stepped closer, her voice low. "The doctor said he’s stable now. That’s a good sign."

Sophia exhaled shakily. Stable wasn’t the same as safe. Not when the man who had orchestrated the attack was still out there.

Nathan’s phone buzzed, and he glanced at the screen, his jaw tightening. "They found the car abandoned near the docks. No sign of him."

Him. Sebastian. Ethan’s twin, the architect of this chaos.

Sophia’s grip on Liam’s hand tightened instinctively. She wouldn’t let him near her son again.

The doors swung open, and Dr. Bennett stepped out, her expression unreadable. "He’s awake."

Relief and dread warred within Sophia. She hesitated, then squared her shoulders. "Liam, stay with Aunt Isabella for a minute, okay?"

The boy looked up at her, his eyes too old for his years. "I want to see Dad."

Her heart ached. After everything, Liam still called Ethan Dad.

Isabella gently took his hand. "Just for a little bit, buddy. Your mom needs to talk to the doctors first."

Sophia followed Dr. Bennett inside, her pulse erratic.

Ethan lay propped up on the bed, his face pale beneath the bruises. But his gaze—sharp and alert—locked onto hers the moment she entered.

"You shouldn’t be here," he rasped.

She crossed her arms. "Where else would I be?"

His jaw clenched. "Somewhere safe. Sebastian won’t stop."

"Neither will I." She stepped closer, her voice dropping to a whisper. "This ends now, Ethan. Tell me everything."

A shadow crossed his face. "It’s not that simple."

"Make it simple."

Outside, the distant wail of a siren pierced the air.

Ethan’s eyes darkened. "He’s already made his next move."

Sophia’s blood ran cold.

Somewhere in the city, the game had just escalated.

And she was out of time.

"Sir?" She answers immediately, her voice crisp through the line.

"Take down the latest article about me and Sophia. Now." My tone is sharp, laced with barely restrained fury.

"I see it. Give me ten minutes."

"And make it clear—anyone who dares publish about Sophia’s private life will be ruined."

"Understood, sir."

I end the call, my grip on the phone tightening.

Sophia has always valued her privacy. And I’ll defend it, no matter the cost.

"What’s really going on between you and Sophia, Ethan?" My mother’s voice cuts through my thoughts. Her gaze is probing, as if she could unravel the truth just by staring into my eyes.

I’m relieved she doesn’t ask about the pregnancy rumors. That’s not my secret to share.

"I don’t know," I admit, frustration seeping into my voice.

"Victoria told me you’ve been avoiding Isabella. That you ended things and refuse to speak to her. Is this because of Sophia?"

I consider lying, but what’s the point?

"Partly."

Her sharp inhale is audible. I don’t meet her eyes, afraid of what I’ll find there.

"Did you know Sophia wasn’t Victoria and William’s biological daughter?" I ask when the silence stretches too long.

"Yes."

"Was that why you hated her?"

"No." Her answer surprises me. "I hated her because she stole your happiness. Your light. You loved Isabella deeply, and because of Sophia’s obsession, you lost her." Her voice wavers. "Watching you become a shell of yourself was agony, Ethan. It was like you died the day she left."

I shake my head, unwilling to revisit that dark period. I was a ghost, barely living.

"You despised her then, but something’s changed. I saw those photos of you two outside the boutique. The way you looked at her—like she held your entire world in her hands. Like you were in love."

I turn to her, stunned. She can’t be right.

"Sebastian confirmed she wasn’t lying about being drunk that night. He obtained the security footage." I deflect, the weight of my past cruelty settling heavily in my chest.

The pain I caused her—she endured it until she couldn’t anymore. Until she cut us out of her life completely.

"Then I owe her an apology for my part in shunning her." Her voice is heavy with regret.

Silence stretches between us, both lost in our thoughts. Then she speaks again.

"You need to tell her, Ethan. Tell Sophia you love her. Nine years have already been wasted—years you could’ve spent happy with her. Don’t wait until it’s too late."

"But how?" I drag a hand down my face. "I don’t even understand what I feel. She’s got me twisted up inside, and I can’t make sense of it."

That’s the torment—not knowing how to define what she means to me.

"Language," she chides before sighing. "You spent so long hating her that those emotions are clashing with what’s emerging now. That’s why you’re confused. You’re trying to reconcile years of resentment with something new."

She continues, softer now. "Take your time. But with Sophia—I saw how she looked at you. Whatever love she once had is either gone or buried deep. Push her too hard, and she’ll shut you out for good."

I nod, absorbing her advice. After a few more minutes, I leave, tension still coiled in my shoulders.

Driving to my office, I finally acknowledge the truth.

I do have feelings for Sophia. Powerful ones.

I just don’t know how deep they run—or what they truly mean.

But it’s time I find out.
###Chapter 158

The hospital corridor stretched endlessly before Sophia, each step heavier than the last.

Her hands trembled as she clutched Liam’s medical report.

The words blurred—congenital heart defect, urgent surgery, high risk.

She pressed a hand to her mouth, stifling a sob.

Liam was just a child.

Her child.

Ethan Blackwood’s voice cut through the sterile air. “We need to talk.”

Sophia turned, her vision swimming.

His jaw was set, his dark eyes unreadable.

She hated how he could still make her pulse race, even now.

“Not here,” she whispered.

The waiting room was empty, save for the hum of the vending machine.

Ethan leaned against the wall, arms crossed. “The surgery’s scheduled for tomorrow.”

Sophia’s breath hitched. “I know.”

“You’re not signing those papers.”

Her spine stiffened. “Excuse me?”

“You heard me.” His voice was low, dangerous. “I won’t let you gamble with his life.”

She laughed, the sound brittle. “You think I want this?”

His gaze flickered. “Then why insist on that surgeon?”

“Because he’s the best!”

“Or because he’s Daniel’s friend?”

The accusation hung between them.

Sophia’s nails dug into her palms. “This isn’t about Daniel.”

Ethan pushed off the wall, closing the distance between them. “Then prove it.”

Her heart hammered.

Before she could respond, her phone buzzed.

A message from Daniel: We need to talk. It’s urgent.

Ethan’s eyes dropped to the screen.

A muscle ticked in his jaw.

“Go ahead,” he said coldly. “Answer it.”

Sophia swallowed hard.

The choice was clear—stay and fight, or walk away.

Again.

Outside, rain began to fall.

Inside, the storm was just beginning.

The second my parents appeared at my doorstep, I knew they'd seen that cursed article.

Scarlett had forwarded me the link moments after I arrived home. It infuriated me beyond measure. I wasn't ready for the world to know, yet those damn paparazzi had splashed it across every corner of the internet.

I wasn't concerned about strangers' reactions. My only fear was how Mom and Dad would take it. I hadn’t found the right moment to tell them about my pregnancy. And everything was infinitely more complicated because Daniel still refused to speak to them.

The article had mysteriously vanished just before my parents arrived. I had a strong hunch Ethan Blackwood was behind it.

Just thinking his name ignited a fury inside me. I shoved aside the memory of what happened in the changing room and focused on my parents, who were watching me with unspoken questions in their eyes.

"You saw the article, didn't you?" I asked, though the answer was obvious.

The house was eerily quiet, mostly because Liam wasn’t home from school yet.

"Yes," Dad answered, his gaze sharp and unwavering.

Mom's voice was soft, laced with hurt. "Sophia, we may not have spent as much time together as we'd like, but... why didn’t you tell us? A baby is a blessing. I thought we were past the point where you felt you couldn’t confide in us."

Her pain cut through me. They had been nothing but incredible parents—the kind I'd always dreamed of having. How could I explain that I wanted to tell them, but the words just wouldn’t come?

"You have to believe me—I tried to tell you so many times. I just... didn’t know how," I whispered, staring at my trembling hands.

Dad frowned. "Why would it be hard to tell us?" He was searching for a reason, but none of this made sense to him.

"Because of who the father is."

Mom inhaled sharply. "You mean Ethan isn’t the father?"

Why did everyone assume Ethan was the one who got me pregnant? We'd been divorced, for heaven's sake.

I shook my head, still avoiding their eyes. Back then, I hadn’t known the truth. But the fact remained—I’d slept with my adopted brother. And it was even worse because Daniel had known everything and still went through with it.

"Sophia, we would never judge you," Mom said gently, sensing my hesitation. "Whoever the father is, it doesn’t matter."

"Even if the father is Daniel?" The words tumbled out, raw and shaky.

It still felt like a sin. Daniel and I weren’t blood-related, but in every way that mattered, he was their son.

The silence that followed was suffocating. Both of them stared at me, stunned. Their lips parted, but no words came out.

Damn it. I knew this was a mistake. What if they hated me? What if they disowned Daniel? I exhaled slowly. But I couldn’t keep this secret forever.

"D-Daniel is the father?" Mom stammered, tears welling in her eyes.

"Yes," I admitted. "I didn’t know he was my adopted brother when we got involved."

"But he knew!" Dad roared, surging to his feet. His face was flushed with fury. "Is this why he’s avoiding us? I never thought he’d sink this low—seducing you when he damn well knew you were our daughter!"

I flinched. I’d never heard Dad swear before.

"He didn’t seduce me," I said firmly, my cheeks inexplicably warming. "I entered the relationship willingly."

Sure, if I’d known the truth, I never would have touched him. But he hadn’t manipulated me. Everything between us had been consensual.

"He deceived you, Sophia," Mom said quietly. "Your father’s right. Daniel knew the truth, and you didn’t. He took advantage of that. What he did was wrong."

"I know," I whispered, my stomach twisting. "And when I think about it, I feel sick. He won’t be in prison forever, and I did offer him the chance to know his child. But how do I explain this to our baby? How do I tell them their father is your son? Adopted or not, Daniel is still family."
###Chapter 159

The moment Sophia stepped into the dimly lit hospital corridor, her pulse quickened.

The sterile scent of antiseptic filled her nostrils, sharp and unforgiving.

Her fingers trembled as she clutched the strap of her bag, her knuckles turning white.

Liam had been rushed here after the accident.

She hadn’t even been there when it happened.

Guilt twisted in her chest like a knife.

Ethan Blackwood stood by the waiting room, his broad shoulders tense, his jaw clenched.

His usually composed demeanor was shattered, replaced by raw, unchecked fear.

Their eyes met.

For a heartbeat, neither spoke.

Then, he exhaled sharply.

"He's stable," Ethan said, his voice rough.

Sophia's knees nearly gave out.

She forced herself to stay upright, gripping the nearest chair for support.

"Where is he?" she demanded, her voice barely above a whisper.

Ethan gestured toward the closed door down the hall.

"Room 312. They're running tests."

She didn’t wait for permission.

Her heels clicked against the linoleum as she strode forward, her heart pounding in her ears.

The door creaked open.

Liam lay on the bed, small and fragile beneath the crisp white sheets.

His face was pale, his dark lashes fanned against his cheeks.

A bandage wrapped around his forehead, stark against his skin.

Sophia’s breath hitched.

She reached out, her fingers hovering just above his hand, afraid to touch him.

Afraid he might break.

A soft sound escaped her lips.

She hadn’t realized she was crying until the first tear fell.

Then, the dam broke.

Her shoulders shook as silent sobs wracked her body.

She had failed him.

Again.

A warm hand settled on her shoulder.

Ethan.

She didn’t pull away.

For once, she let herself lean into his touch.

"We’ll figure this out," he murmured, his voice low and steady.

Sophia swallowed hard.

She wanted to believe him.

But the fear was still there, gnawing at her insides.

Because this wasn’t just an accident.

Someone had done this.

And she would make sure they paid.

This had been my greatest fear. The thought of my child seeing me through tainted eyes terrified me. I could reveal the truth, but that would paint their father as a monster—a twisted, cruel man who didn’t deserve the title of "dad."

Mom rises from her seat and moves beside me, pulling me into a warm embrace. My vision blurs as tears threaten to spill.

Damn these pregnancy hormones.

"It's alright, sweetheart. Don’t stress over it. We love you, and we’ll adore this baby just the same," Dad reassures, joining the hug.

We stay like that for a long moment, wrapped in each other’s arms before finally pulling apart.

"Another grandbaby! This is incredible—I need to go shopping immediately!" Mom exclaims, her face lighting up with pure delight. She bounces on her toes like an overexcited teenager.

"Who else can say they became a grandmother at forty-three? I’m young, stylish, and still have the energy to chase after my grandkids!"

Dad and I exchange amused glances as Mom twirls around my living room, graceful as a dancer. Dad catches her mid-spin, pulling her close and pressing a kiss to her lips before spinning her again, her laughter filling the room.

A bittersweet ache tugs at my heart as I watch them. This was the kind of love I’d once dreamed of—passionate, enduring, effortless. But I’d long since buried those fantasies. Some people weren’t destined for that kind of happiness.

They stay a little longer before finally leaving, and I exhale, feeling lighter than I had in weeks. My biggest fear—that they’d reject my child—had been put to rest. Their excitement soothed something raw inside me.

Soon, Liam arrives home, and I busy myself helping him with homework and preparing snacks. I thrive on routine, so I lay out his uniform for the next day and organize his school supplies.

Just as I finish, a sharp knock echoes through the apartment. Sighing, I shuffle to the door and pull it open.

"Sophia Sterling?" the deliveryman asks gruffly.

I wince. I really needed to change my last name. Sterling didn’t belong to me anymore.

"Yeah?"

"Got a delivery for you."

I resist the urge to roll my eyes. Did they think I couldn’t figure that out on my own?

"I didn’t order anything," I say flatly.

"Not my problem," he snaps.

Rude. Maybe he caught my annoyed expression. Before I can retort, he shoves a box into my hands and stalks off.

I stare after him, stunned, mentally noting the company name on his uniform. I hadn’t ordered a thing, but I’d definitely be leaving a scathing review later.

Carrying the box inside, I set it on the coffee table.

"What’s that?" Liam asks, eyeing it with curiosity.

"No idea," I mutter.

I hesitate, fingers hovering over the tape. With the Reapers still a threat, this could be anything—a bomb, a threat, a sick joke.

Before I can decide, Liam snatches the box and rips it open.

"Liam!" I gasp, my heart lurching into my throat.

If that had been a bomb, we’d both be dead. Did he have no sense of self-preservation?

"You don’t just open strange packages!" I scold, struggling to steady my racing pulse.

He shrugs. "I was curious."

Peering inside, his face twists in disappointment. "Ugh. I thought it’d be something cool. It’s just a bunch of dresses."

Wait—what?

I grab the box from him and pull out the contents. One by one, I unfold delicate maternity dresses—each one from the boutique I’d loved before everything went wrong with Ethan.

My stomach drops.

Ethan. That bastard must have bought them.

"Pretty dresses, Mommy. You’ll look beautiful," Liam says cheerfully, oblivious to the fury simmering inside me.

The thought of burning them crosses my mind.
###Chapter 160

The moment Sophia stepped into the dimly lit room, her breath hitched.

The air was thick with tension, the scent of aged leather and faint cigar smoke lingering.

Ethan Blackwood stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, his broad shoulders outlined against the city lights.

She hadn’t expected him to be here.

Not after everything.

Not after the way they’d left things.

His voice was low, rough with barely restrained emotion. "You shouldn’t have come."

Sophia clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms. "I didn’t have a choice."

A bitter laugh escaped him. "There’s always a choice."

She swallowed hard, forcing herself to meet his piercing gaze. "Liam needs you."

Ethan’s expression darkened. "And what about you?"

The question hung between them, heavy with unspoken words.

Sophia’s heart pounded.

She couldn’t answer.

Not honestly.

Not when the truth would shatter them both.

A sharp knock at the door broke the silence.

Sebastian strode in, his usual smirk absent. "We have a problem."

Ethan didn’t turn. "What now?"

Sebastian’s gaze flicked to Sophia before settling on his brother. "Hawk’s men are moving. They’re coming for her."

Ice flooded Sophia’s veins.

Ethan finally turned, his eyes blazing. "Then we move first."

Sebastian nodded. "Already on it."

Sophia took a step back. "Wait—what’s happening?"

Ethan closed the distance between them in two strides, his hand gripping her wrist. "You’re not leaving my sight."

She yanked her arm free. "I don’t need your protection."

His jaw tightened. "Like hell you don’t."

Sebastian cleared his throat. "We don’t have time for this."

Ethan’s gaze never left Sophia’s. "Pack your things. You and Liam are coming with me."

She shook her head. "No."

A muscle ticked in his jaw. "This isn’t a request."

Sophia lifted her chin. "And I’m not your wife anymore."

The words landed like a blow.

Ethan’s expression hardened. "Fine. But if you won’t do it for me, do it for Liam."

Her resolve wavered.

Damn him.

Sebastian’s phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, his face grim. "We’re out of time."

Ethan grabbed Sophia’s hand, his grip unyielding. "Let’s go."

She hesitated.

Then the sound of shattering glass sent her heart into her throat.

Ethan shoved her behind him just as the first bullet struck the wall.

Chaos erupted.

And Sophia realized—

She had no choice at all.

"Thank you, my love." I force a smile, though it feels brittle. "I'm going to prepare dinner. Finish up so you can take a shower."

Leaving the box of clothes behind, I retreat to the kitchen. My fingers tighten around the counter's edge as I stare blankly at the ingredients laid out. The clothes—Ethan's sudden, uncharacteristic gesture—weigh on my mind. I don't want them. I don't want anything from him.

If we're being honest, this is the first time he's ever given me anything.

The memory of the changing room flashes behind my eyelids—his darkened gaze, the way his body pressed against mine. It wasn't just unexpected. It was wrong. Ethan Blackwood doesn't look at me like that. He never has.

So what the hell changed?

"Sophia."

I whirl around at the sound of his voice, my pulse spiking. He stands in the kitchen doorway, his presence like a storm rolling in uninvited.

"What are you doing here?" My voice is sharp, edged with the anger I can't suppress. "And how did you get in?"

"Liam let me in." He takes a step forward, but I don't retreat.

I don't want him here. Not in my house. Not in my life. He doesn’t get to treat me like garbage for nine years and then suddenly decide he wants to play the devoted husband. It doesn’t work like that.

"Get out." The words snap like a whip.

"Sophia—"

"Get out of my fucking house, Ethan."

The dam cracks. Every cruel word, every dismissive glance, every time he made me feel invisible—it all rushes back, drowning me in bitterness. My vision blurs with unshed tears, but I refuse to let them fall. Not in front of him. Never again.

"Listen to me—"

"Like you listened when I told you I was drowning and you didn’t care?" My voice shakes. "Or when I begged you to give us a chance, and you walked away like I meant nothing?" I drag in a breath, fighting to steady myself. "I've heard enough from you to last a lifetime. I left. Isn’t that what you always wanted? So why can’t you do the same for me?"

My nails dig into my palms. "Haven’t I paid enough for loving you? What more do you want?"

Silence stretches between us, thick and suffocating.

His jaw clenches. Something flickers in his eyes—pain? Regret? I don’t care. I don’t have the energy to decipher him anymore.

"You’ve spent years throwing Isabella in my face. Well, she’s here now, Ethan. You can have the love of your fucking life. Just leave me alone." My voice breaks. "Don’t come to my appointments. Don’t take me shopping. Don’t buy me clothes. Ignore me like you always have."

I sag against the counter, exhaustion crashing over me.

"Are you two fighting?" Liam’s voice cuts through the tension.

His young face is set in a frown, his eyes darting between us.

"No," I say tiredly. "Your father was just leaving."

I glare at Ethan, silently demanding he go. Praying he never steps foot in this house again.

Liam hesitates, then nods and walks away.

Ethan turns to leave but pauses at the threshold. His back is rigid, his voice low. "I’m sorry, Sophia. So fucking sorry."

The words are rough, as if they’re being torn from him.

"Just go," I whisper. "And take the clothes with you."

"No."

I grit my teeth, resisting the urge to hurl something at his head.

"Fine. I’ll donate them."

"Do what you want. They’re yours."

Then he’s gone.

Muffled voices drift from the hall, followed by the click of the front door. The air in the kitchen lightens instantly, as if his presence had been a physical weight.

As I start dinner, I steel myself.

This time, I won’t break.
###Chapter 161

The moment Sophia stepped into the dimly lit interrogation room, her pulse quickened.

Daniel Carter sat across from her, his hands cuffed to the table. His piercing blue eyes locked onto hers, filled with a mix of defiance and something else—something raw.

"You shouldn't be here," he said, his voice rough.

She ignored the warning, pulling out the chair opposite him. "I need answers."

The air between them crackled with tension.

Daniel leaned forward, the chains rattling. "You don’t know what you’re getting into."

Sophia didn’t flinch. "Try me."

A slow smirk curved his lips, but it didn’t reach his eyes. "Your ex-husband isn’t the man you think he is."

Her breath hitched.

Before she could respond, the door swung open.

Gregory, the chief of police, stood there, his expression grim. "Time’s up, Ms. Blackwood."

Daniel’s gaze never left hers. "This isn’t over."

Sophia stood, her mind racing.

As she walked out, she could still feel the weight of his stare.

Something told her he was right.

This was far from over.

The weight of the morning pressed down on me like a lead blanket. Liam’s anger still lingered in the air, a bitter reminder of my failed attempt to shield him from the truth. Kicking Ethan out had seemed like the right decision at the time, but now? Now it just felt like another lie in a long string of them.

I hated that we ever pretended in front of Liam. We thought we were protecting him, giving him some illusion of a happy family. Instead, we fed him a fantasy—one where his parents might magically fall back in love.

How was I supposed to tell him the truth without shattering his heart? How do you explain to a child that everything he believed about his parents was just a carefully constructed lie?

My greatest fear wasn’t his anger—it was his disappointment. The moment he realized we’d deceived him, he might never look at us the same way again. But we couldn’t keep this up. He needed to know that Ethan and I were never getting back together.

With a heavy sigh, I dragged myself out of bed. Sleep had been fleeting lately, my growing belly making every movement more exhausting than the last.

The shower did little to wash away the fatigue clinging to my bones. I slipped into a white sundress dotted with delicate blue flowers, the fabric skimming just above my knees. No more hiding—my parents knew about the pregnancy, and honestly? I was too tired to care who else saw.

A swipe of concealer under my eyes did nothing to mask the exhaustion. I wasn’t in the mood for visitors, but fate had other plans.

The doorbell rang just as I reached the bottom of the stairs.

I should’ve ignored it.

But curiosity got the better of me.

Nathan stood on my doorstep, looking like he hadn’t slept in days. His usual polished arrogance was gone, replaced by something raw and desperate.

I moved to slam the door in his face, but he caught it before I could.

"Please, Sophia," he rasped, his voice ragged.

I arched a brow. "What do you want?"

The coldness in my own voice surprised me. It wasn’t forced—just automatic, like speaking to a stranger.

"Can I come in?"

"Absolutely not. Say what you need to say and leave."

He hesitated, and that alone was enough to pique my interest. Nathan had never been the type to falter. Seeing him like this? Unsettling.

"Spit it out. I don’t have all day."

His jaw tightened before he finally spoke, his voice barely above a whisper. "I need you to talk to Eleanor and Alexander."

"About what?"

"Sterling Corp." His voice cracked. "They’re destroying us. Investors are pulling out. Customers are leaving. We’re bleeding money, Sophia."

I blinked. I’d assumed my parents' threats were just that—empty warnings. But they’d actually gone through with it.

Nathan loved that company more than anything. For him to come here, practically begging? He was out of options.

"You realize I don’t care if your company burns to the ground, right?" I crossed my arms, watching him closely.

He looked wrecked—dark circles under his eyes, his clothes rumpled. Like a man who’d been fighting a losing battle for too long.

Amelia hadn’t mentioned any of this to me. Then again, I’d made it clear I never wanted to hear Nathan’s name again.

"Please," he whispered. "We’re family."

That word sent a sharp jolt of anger through me.

"Family?" I scoffed. "You disowned me, Nathan. You told me I was dead to you. For nine years, you acted like I didn’t exist. So tell me—where was this ‘family’ loyalty then?"
###Chapter 162

The hospital corridor stretched endlessly before Sophia, each step heavier than the last.

Her hands trembled as she clutched the edge of her coat, the sterile scent of antiseptic burning her nostrils.

Liam’s small voice echoed in her mind—"Mom, when are you coming home?"—but home felt like a distant dream now.

Ethan Blackwood stood rigid by the window, his silhouette sharp against the pale morning light.

She could see the tension in his shoulders, the way his fingers curled into fists at his sides.

"Tell me again," he demanded, voice low and dangerous.

Sophia swallowed hard. "I didn’t know. I swear—"

"Didn’t know?" His laugh was bitter. "Or didn’t care?"

The accusation stung, but she refused to flinch.

Her phone buzzed—Daniel. Again.

She silenced it without looking.

Ethan turned, his gaze piercing. "You expect me to believe this was all just a coincidence?"

Sophia exhaled sharply. "I didn’t plan any of this."

"Yet here we are." His jaw clenched. "With my son in danger because of you."

The words hit like a physical blow.

Somewhere down the hall, a monitor beeped steadily.

Liam’s heartbeat.

Alive.

For now.

Sophia’s vision blurred. "I’ll fix this."

Ethan scoffed. "How?"

She had no answer.

Not yet.

But she would find one.

Even if it destroyed her.

The door creaked open—Isabella, pale and wide-eyed.

"They’re here," she whispered.

Sophia’s blood ran cold.

Too soon.

Ethan’s expression darkened. "Who?"

Isabella hesitated. "The police. And… someone else."

Sophia met Ethan’s gaze.

The game had just changed.

And neither of them was ready.

"Nathan..."

I didn’t let him finish. His words meant nothing to me now.

"Every time you sided with Isabella, every time you treated me like I was worthless. Every damn time you laughed when Ethan shattered my heart because I dared to hurt your precious sister—did you ever consider me family? What about when you said I deserved the pain? Or when William and Victoria acted like I didn’t exist? What about all those years you all pushed me away? Was I still your family then?"

Silence.

But what could he say? He knew the truth. Back then, I was nothing to him—just an unwanted burden. Someone they’d gladly erase if they could.

"So tell me, if you never saw me as family before, why should I see you as family now? This little act of yours won’t work on me."

My gaze burned into his. I used to notice the differences between us. Nathan and Isabella didn’t look alike, but you could tell they were siblings. Me? I didn’t resemble any of them. That should’ve been my first clue—I never belonged.

"Let’s be real. You never cared about me. The only reason you’re here is because you think you can use me. But I won’t let you. Go home, Nathan. And don’t ever come back."

With that, I shoved him away and slammed the door hard. My back pressed against it as I struggled to steady my breathing. A few minutes passed before I heard his car roar to life and speed off.

I needed to get out.

Grabbing my keys, I headed for the door—then paused. My eyes landed on the clothes Ethan had bought. I snatched them up, deciding to drop them off at a shelter on my way.

Minutes later, I was on the road, my mind a storm of emotions. First Ethan, now Nathan. The audacity of them, thinking they could just waltz back into my life and demand forgiveness. As if years of pain could be erased with a few hollow words.

If Ethan wasn’t Liam’s father, I would’ve cut him out completely. Everything I did, I did for Liam. So many times, I’ve been tempted to take him far away—but the love he has for his father always stops me.

I wanted to leave this place, but I knew it would hurt Liam. Ethan thought Liam loved me more. He didn’t realize the boy adored him just as much.

Spotting an ice cream shop, I pulled in. The front was crowded, so I parked around back.

I needed comfort. Maybe ice cream would help clear my head.

Inside the cozy little shop, I ordered a massive bowl. Normally, I’d eat any flavor, but when I was upset, only plain vanilla would do.

My thoughts drifted back to Nathan. I had no idea what my parents were thinking. I wasn’t the vengeful type—usually, I let karma handle things. And trust me, karma had a way of wrecking people in ways I never could.

But this time, I was torn. Part of me wanted to watch them burn. The other part just wanted to forget they existed. Did it make me cruel that the bigger part wanted them to suffer?

I finished my ice cream, but the conflict remained. Maybe talking to someone would help.

Deciding to see my therapist, I headed back to my car.

I never made it.

A hand clamped over my mouth and nose before I could scream. The world blurred—then vanished into darkness.
###Chapter 163

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the bedroom floor. Sophia stirred, blinking against the light as memories of last night flooded back.

Ethan’s arms were still wrapped around her, his breathing steady and warm against her neck. She traced the faint scar on his forearm—a remnant of a past he rarely spoke about.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand.

Isabella’s name flashed across the screen. Sophia hesitated before answering.

"Sophia, we need to talk," her sister’s voice was urgent, laced with something unreadable.

Sophia sat up, the sheets pooling around her waist. "What’s wrong?"

"It’s about Liam."

Her breath hitched. Ethan’s grip tightened slightly, as if sensing her tension even in sleep.

Isabella continued, "He was asking about you last night. He… he remembers things, Sophia. Things from before."

Sophia’s pulse roared in her ears. Before. The word hung between them, heavy with implications.

Ethan shifted behind her, his voice rough with sleep. "Everything okay?"

She forced a smile. "Just family stuff."

But it wasn’t just family stuff. It was the past clawing its way back into the present.

Downstairs, the front door creaked open. Footsteps echoed in the hallway—light, familiar.

Liam.

Sophia’s heart clenched. She hadn’t seen him in weeks, not since the custody battle had turned ugly.

Ethan sat up, rubbing his eyes. "You should go talk to him."

She nodded, slipping out of bed. The hardwood floor was cool beneath her bare feet as she padded toward the door.

Liam stood in the foyer, his backpack slung over one shoulder. His eyes—so much like Ethan’s—widened when he saw her.

"Mom?"

The word was a knife to her chest.

Sophia swallowed hard. "Hey, sweetheart. What are you doing here?"

Liam shifted uncomfortably. "Dad said I could visit. He’s… busy."

Busy. The word was a euphemism for something darker.

She reached out, brushing a lock of hair from his forehead. "I’m glad you’re here."

Liam hesitated before blurting, "I had a dream about you last night. About the fire."

Sophia froze.

The fire. The one that had torn their family apart. The one Ethan had sworn was an accident.

Liam’s voice dropped to a whisper. "I remember the smoke. And… and you carrying me out."

Her vision blurred. She hadn’t realized he remembered any of it.

Ethan appeared in the doorway, his expression unreadable. "Liam."

The boy stiffened. "Dad."

The air thickened with tension.

Sophia forced a smile. "Let’s have breakfast, okay? We can talk."

But as she led Liam toward the kitchen, she couldn’t shake the feeling that the past was no longer content to stay buried.

And this time, it wouldn’t go quietly.

"Wake up!"

I groan but keep my eyes shut. The voice sounds distant, almost like a dream.

Why would it sound so familiar?

"Sophia, wake the hell up!"

My eyes snap open. That voice is too sharp, too real to be imagined.

And why the hell would I dream about her?

Blinking, my vision slowly clears.

Memories flood back.

Shit. I've been kidnapped. Again.

My head throbs from what I assume was chloroform. I pray it didn’t harm the baby.

I’m tied to a chair, wrists bound tightly behind me. The ropes dig into my skin. No chance of escaping.

"Are you done?"

I whip my head to the left.

Isabella.

Tied to another chair, looking far more alert than I feel.

"What the hell are you doing here?" I demand.

The room is bare—no furniture, no windows. Just us and the chairs.

No clues.

"Isn’t it obvious?" she drawls. "We’ve been kidnapped."

I roll my eyes. "No shit. I meant why take both of us?"

The Reapers are the only threat left. But why target Isabella and me? If anything, she’s more valuable to the Sterlings and Ethan than I am.

"I don’t know," she admits.

"How long have you been here?" I steady my breathing. Panicking won’t help.

But the déjà vu is suffocating.

This feels like the night Daniel betrayed me. The only difference? Last time, it was Amelia with me. Now, it’s Isabella.

Fear coils in my chest.

What if history repeats itself?

What if someone I trust stabs me in the back again?

"I woke up just as they brought you in," Isabella says, snapping me back.

"How long was I out?"

"Fifteen, maybe twenty minutes."

I do the math. Useless. No idea how far we are from the ice cream shop.

Then it hits me.

Liam.

Who’s picking him up? School ends at 3:30. It was already noon when I was taken.

What if they took him too?

Breathe.

The school will call Ethan if I don’t show. He’ll keep Liam safe.

I repeat it until my pulse slows.

Liam will be fine.

I need to focus on surviving this.

"So it’s true," Isabella says, eyeing my bump. "You are pregnant."

Even as a hostage, she looks flawless. Infuriating.

I ignore her.

My pregnancy is none of her damn business.

"Not surprised, honestly. With your reputation, it was bound to happen. Do you even know who the father is?" She smirks.

I snap. "Nope. I’ve slept with so many men, I lost count."

Less than an hour awake, and I already want to beg our kidnappers to shoot me.

Isabella is insufferable. How did I never notice before?

"You don’t have to be so rude," she huffs, like I’m the problem.
###Chapter 164

The morning sun streamed through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the bedroom floor. Sophia stretched lazily, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her.

Liam had already left for school, and the house was eerily quiet.

She rolled onto her back, staring at the ceiling. The events of last night replayed in her mind—Ethan’s unexpected visit, the tension between them, the way his gaze had lingered on her lips before he abruptly left.

A shiver ran down her spine.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. Isabella’s name flashed across the screen.

"Call me when you’re awake. We need to talk."

Sophia frowned. Her sister rarely sounded this urgent.

She dialed immediately.

Isabella picked up on the first ring. "Finally. I was starting to think you’d sleep all day."

Sophia sat up, rubbing her temple. "What’s going on?"

"You won’t believe who I just ran into."

A pause.

"Olivia."

Sophia’s breath hitched. Ethan’s secretary. The woman who had made her life hell during the divorce.

"What did she want?"

Isabella’s voice dropped. "She was at the café, whispering to some guy in a suit. Looked shady. Then she spotted me and bolted."

Sophia’s grip tightened around her phone. Olivia had no reason to be in town unless Ethan had sent her.

But why?

Her thoughts were interrupted by a sharp knock at the front door.

"Hold on," she muttered, sliding out of bed.

She padded downstairs, her bare feet silent against the hardwood. Through the peephole, she saw Daniel—his jaw set, his expression unreadable.

Her stomach twisted.

She yanked the door open. "Daniel?"

His eyes darkened as they met hers. "We have a problem."

Behind her, Isabella’s voice crackled through the phone. "Sophia? What’s happening?"

But Sophia couldn’t answer.

Because Daniel held up a single photograph—one that made her blood run cold.

It was Liam.

And standing beside him, a shadowy figure with a gun.

"Keep your damn mouth shut if you know what's good for you."

I twist against the ropes, my wrists burning from the friction. There was no way in hell I was staying tied up like this. Not with her. Not with whatever twisted game they were playing.

"Nothing like a little girl fight to spice things up. Should I untie you two and let you hash it out?" A deep voice cuts through the tension.

I hadn’t even heard the door open. Too focused on Isabella. Stupid. So stupid.

"Go ahead. Untie me. After I’m done with her, you’re next," I snap, letting the venom drip from my words.

The man just laughs. Of course he does. To him, I’m nothing. A fly to swat away.

"I’d love to see you try."

I roll my eyes. "Is this really how you get your kicks? Kidnapping women? Does it make you feel powerful, drugging someone who can’t fight back?"

"Shut your mouth!" he roars, his face twisting into something ugly.

He takes a step toward me, his body coiled like a predator.

"Or what?" I challenge.

"What the hell are you doing? Stop provoking him!" Isabella hisses, her voice trembling.

I ignore her, smirking up at the brute. "They should cut off your balls. Any man who has to drug women isn’t a man at all."

I don’t even know why I’m pushing him. Maybe because feeling helpless makes me reckless.

His fist moves faster than I can blink. The impact rattles my teeth, sends white-hot pain exploding through my skull.

For a second, everything goes black. My ears ring. The metallic taste of blood floods my mouth.

When my vision clears, I spit a mouthful of red onto his boots.

"What the hell is going on here?"

A new voice. Cold. Commanding.

The brute stiffens. "Sorry, boss. She was pissing me off."

Footsteps echo as the man steps into view.

Tattoos snake up his arms, but that’s not what catches my attention.

It’s his face.

Sharp green eyes. Black hair that falls just right. Cheekbones that could cut glass. Lips that belong on a damn romance cover.

He radiates power. The kind that makes the air thick. The kind that could give Ethan Blackwood a run for his money—and that’s saying something.

I glance at Isabella. She’s staring, slack-jawed. Guess I’m not the only one struck stupid.

"I don’t care what she said. You don’t touch them." His voice is a lethal growl.

The temperature in the room drops. The kind of cold that slithers down your spine.

I shake my head, trying to clear the fog. What the hell was that? Some kind of hypnotic charm?

"Who are you?" I demand. "What do you want with us?"

The tattooed god smiles. Slow. Dangerous.

"Damien Slade," he says, like it should mean something. "As for why you’re here? Simple. Your ex-husband crossed me. Now, it’s payback time."

My heart stutters.

Ethan.

This is about Ethan.

He keeps talking, his voice smooth as poison. "He nearly destroyed my empire. Now, I’m going to return the favor."

The realization hits me like a truck.

"You’re part of the Reapers," I whisper.

His laugh is ice down my spine.

"No, sweetheart. I’m not part of the Reapers." He leans in, his breath hot against my ear. "I am the Reaper."

Fuck.

This just went from bad to catastrophic.

And it’s all my father’s fault.

He should’ve stayed out of Ethan’s business.
###Chapter 165

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the hospital corridor as Sophia paced restlessly.

Her fingers trembled as she clutched her phone, the screen dark and silent.

No calls. No messages.

Liam had been missing for hours.

Ethan Blackwood’s voice crackled through the phone when she finally dialed his number. "Sophia, I’m on my way. Stay where you are."

She exhaled sharply, her nails digging into her palms.

The sterile scent of antiseptic burned her nostrils, a cruel reminder of the last time she had been in this hospital—when Iris was born.

Now, her son was gone.

A nurse approached, her expression carefully neutral. "Mrs. Blackwood, we’ve checked every floor. There’s no sign of him."

Sophia’s stomach twisted.

Liam wouldn’t just wander off. Not after everything that had happened.

Her phone buzzed.

An unknown number.

Her breath hitched as she swiped to answer.

A distorted voice chuckled. "Looking for someone, Sophia?"

Ice flooded her veins.

She recognized that tone—the same one from the night Victor Graves had cornered her in the alley.

But Graves was dead.

Which meant someone else was playing this game.

Ethan burst through the doors, his dark eyes scanning the room before locking onto her. "What happened?"

Sophia swallowed hard.

"They took him."

The words tasted like ash.

Ethan’s jaw clenched. "Who?"

She handed him the phone, the call still connected.

The voice laughed again. "Ah, Ethan. So good of you to join us."

Ethan’s grip tightened on the device. "What do you want?"

"Same thing I’ve always wanted," the voice purred. "A reckoning."

Then the line went dead.

Sophia’s knees buckled.

Ethan caught her before she could fall, his arms wrapping around her like steel bands. "We’ll get him back."

She wanted to believe him.

But the clock was ticking.

And somewhere out there, Liam was alone.

With monsters.

Ethan Blackwood

"Are you planning to sulk here indefinitely?" Sebastian snaps, irritation lacing his tone.

I don’t dignify him with a response. My gaze remains fixed on the whiskey swirling in my glass, the amber liquid mocking me with its clarity—unlike the mess I’ve made with Sophia.

I’m not foolish enough to dismiss her reaction as irrational. She’s behaving exactly as anyone would after being repeatedly wounded by those they trusted most.

A relentless urge claws at me—to ease her pain, to erase every scar I’ve left. But how? When I’m the one who carved them into her in the first place.

"You can’t keep this up, Ethan. If she’s ghosting you, back the hell off! Isabella’s throwing herself at you, for Christ’s sake. It’s not like you’re short on options," he mutters, dropping into the chair across from me.

I don’t entertain his nonsense. Instead, I shoot him a glare sharp enough to draw blood. "If my mood offends you, the door’s right there."

He doesn’t get it. And I’m not in the mood to explain. Every fiber of me rejects Isabella—rejects anyone who isn’t Sophia.

I used to loathe her. Convinced I’d never crave her. Famous last damn words. Now, she’s all I see—every thought, every fantasy, drenched in her.

Karma’s a vicious bitch. The moment I admit I want her, she’s already gone. The proof? She’s carrying another man’s child. A brutal declaration that she’s moved on.

I was once the only man who’d touched her. The only one who knew her intimately. And like an idiot, I never valued that privilege. Now, someone else knows the taste of her skin, and it fucking guts me. Daniel gave her what I withheld during our marriage.

I shove the thoughts aside, striding to the floor-to-ceiling windows of my office. The mere idea of another man’s hands on her is torture. Maybe now I understand how she felt when I flaunted Isabella between us.

Damn it. How do I make her see I’m not here to hurt her? That I want to fix what I broke?

You want to fix it, yet you won’t admit you love her? A voice sneers. When will you stop lying to yourself?

I silence it. Refusing to drown.

Yes, I feel something for Sophia. I don’t know when it started. But if I told her now? She’d laugh in my face. After nine years of cruelty, why would she believe me?

The door creaks open. I don’t turn.

"What’s got you in such a charming mood?" Sebastian drawls.

I don’t need to look to know he’s talking to Nathan. We’ve been friends since diapers. We know each other’s tells better than our own.

"Sophia."

Her name whips me around. My focus zeroes in on Nathan.

He looks wrecked. Dark circles, hollow cheeks—like he hasn’t slept in weeks.

"What happened?" My voice is rougher than I intend.

"I asked for her help with the company. She refused." He exhales, rubbing his temples.

I’ve offered to step in, but he’s stubborn. The Prescotts kept their word. Sterling Corp is sinking. Without intervention, it’ll be bankrupt in two months.
###Chapter 166

The moment Sophia stepped into the dimly lit hospital corridor, her pulse quickened.

The sterile scent of antiseptic filled her lungs, sharp and suffocating.

Her fingers trembled as she clutched the strap of her bag, knuckles whitening.

She wasn’t ready.

Not for this.

Not for him.

Liam’s small voice echoed in her mind, his tearful plea before she left the house. "Mom, please don’t go."

But she had to.

Ethan Blackwood was awake.

And she needed answers.

The guard stationed outside his room gave her a curt nod before stepping aside.

Her breath hitched as she pushed the door open.

There he was.

Propped against the pillows, his face pale but alert, those piercing green eyes locking onto hers instantly.

A storm of emotions crashed through her—anger, betrayal, but beneath it all, an ache she couldn’t name.

"You came," he murmured, voice rough from disuse.

Sophia stiffened. "Don’t flatter yourself. I’m here for Liam."

His jaw tightened, but he didn’t argue.

Silence stretched between them, thick and heavy.

Then, with a slow exhale, he spoke again. "I never meant for any of this to happen."

A bitter laugh escaped her. "Funny how that’s always your excuse."

His gaze darkened. "Sophia—"

"No." She cut him off, stepping closer. "You don’t get to say my name like that. Not after everything."

The heart monitor beeped steadily, the only sound in the room.

She forced herself to meet his eyes. "Who hired the hitman?"

Ethan’s expression shuttered. "It’s complicated."

"Uncomplicate it."

A muscle ticked in his jaw. "You’re safer not knowing."

Her nails dug into her palms. "I swear to God, Ethan—"

The door burst open.

Daniel Carter stood there, his police badge glinting under the fluorescent lights. His sharp gaze darted between them before settling on Sophia.

"We need to talk. Now."

Her stomach dropped.

Something was wrong.

Ethan’s voice was low, urgent. "Sophia, whatever he says—"

But Daniel was already pulling her into the hallway.

His grip on her arm was firm. "We found another body."

Her blood ran cold.

"Who?"

His next words sent a chill down her spine.

"Someone close to you."

The sole reason our company hadn't collapsed yet was because we still held power equal to the Prescotts. Their withdrawal and the subsequent departure of their loyal investors hadn’t crippled us—not entirely.

But I wasn’t naive enough to believe this was over. They might not have managed to destroy Blackwood Industries, but I knew damn well they’d find another way to retaliate. And I wouldn’t fight them. They had every right to come after me. After what I did to their daughter, I deserved whatever hell they planned to unleash.

"Is that what’s eating at you? That she refused to help?" Sebastian’s voice was laced with sympathy as he studied Nathan’s defeated posture.

Nathan exhaled, long and weary. "No. It’s what she said. She told me she doesn’t consider me family." His jaw clenched. "Meaning I’m nothing to her now."

I saw the raw pain flicker across his face, but I felt no pity. We had been monsters to her. The way Sophia treated us now was still kinder than we deserved.

"What the hell did you expect?" Sebastian muttered, frustration edging his tone. "I keep asking you all the same damn question."

"I know." Nathan slumped deeper into his chair, looking utterly broken. "I don’t know why I keep hoping she’ll be the same girl she was before. That version of Sophia is gone. The only time you see even a flicker of her now is when she’s with Liam."

My phone buzzed, cutting through the heavy silence. An unknown number flashed on the screen. For a second, I considered ignoring it—until instinct told me otherwise.

"Didn’t I promise I’d make you pay?" The voice on the other end was chillingly familiar.

My grip tightened around the phone. "What the fuck do you want, Damien?"

Damien Slade—better known as the Reaper—let out a low, mocking laugh. "Don’t you want to know who I have with me?"

I wasn’t easily rattled, but this bastard was unhinged. The smugness in his tone sent a cold dread creeping down my spine.

"Spit it out," I growled. "I don’t have time for games."

My voice stayed steady, but panic clawed at my chest. He had someone I cared about. And that realization alone was enough to push me toward the edge.

"Since you’re so eager," he drawled, deliberately dragging out the moment, "I’ll tell you. I’ve got two lovely ladies here. The love of your miserable life… and the mother of your child."

My heart stuttered. Then it kicked back to life, pounding violently against my ribs.

Nathan and Sebastian went rigid, sensing the shift in the air.

"What do you want?" My entire body had gone numb, as if encased in ice.

"It’s simple." His voice dripped with amusement. "You choose who lives and who dies. I’ll spare one and kill the other. Generous, don’t you think? At least you get to walk away with one of them instead of losing both."

Fuck. This was worse than I’d imagined. The bastard had completely lost his mind.

"Tick tock, Ethan," he taunted. "Time’s running out."

The line went dead.

Sebastian’s eyes locked onto mine. "What happened?"

"Damien has Sophia and Isabella." I forced air into my lungs, fighting to stay calm. "He’s making me choose."

"Goddammit!" Nathan roared, slamming his fist against the desk.

This was beyond fucked up.

I would move heaven and hell to get them both back alive. But if it came down to it—if I had to choose—I already knew who I’d pick.

The real question was… would I ever be forgiven for sacrificing the other?
###Chapter 167

The moment Sophia stepped into the dimly lit hospital corridor, her pulse quickened.

The sterile scent of antiseptic filled her nostrils, sharp and unrelenting.

She clutched Liam’s small hand tighter, his fingers warm against her clammy palm.

"Mom?" His voice was soft, uncertain.

She forced a smile. "It’s okay, sweetheart."

But nothing about this was okay.

Ethan Blackwood stood at the far end of the hall, his broad shoulders tense beneath his tailored suit.

His stormy gaze locked onto hers, unreadable.

Sophia’s breath hitched.

She hadn’t seen him since the night everything shattered.

Now, here they were—bound by tragedy yet divided by betrayal.

Liam tugged her sleeve. "Is Dad mad?"

Her throat tightened.

She didn’t know anymore.

Ethan strode forward, his polished shoes clicking against the linoleum.

Each step felt like a hammer to her ribs.

Then, he stopped—just inches away.

Close enough for her to catch the faint trace of his cologne, the one she used to love.

"Sophia." His voice was rough, edged with something dark.

She lifted her chin. "Ethan."

Silence stretched between them, heavy with unspoken words.

Liam shifted nervously.

Ethan’s jaw clenched. "We need to talk."

Her stomach twisted.

She knew what was coming.

The truth.

The lies.

The end.

But before she could respond, a door creaked open behind them.

A nurse—Charlotte—stepped out, her expression grim.

"Mr. Blackwood? Ms. Blackwood?"

Sophia’s heart plummeted.

This was it.

The moment that would change everything.

Again.

"You can't possibly mean that," Isabella gasped, her shock mirroring my own.

My heart hammered violently against my ribs. Fear coiled around my chest like a vise, stealing my breath. If I thought Damian Slade—or Reaper, whatever the hell he called himself—kidnapping us was the worst of it, I was dead wrong. His plan was far more twisted.

"Oh, but I do," Damian sneered, his lips curling into a cruel smile that sent ice slithering down my spine. "Your father should never have crossed me. Neither should Ethan. Now, it's time for my revenge."

He had called Ethan right in front of us and laid out his sick ultimatum. I still couldn't wrap my head around it—only one of us would leave this place alive.

The weight of impending doom pressed down on me, suffocating. My face throbbed from his earlier blow, my lip split and raw. I clung to that pain, desperate for something to ground me before panic swallowed me whole.

"Cat got your tongue, Sophia?" Damian taunted, that same chilling smirk playing on his lips.

I looked away, my mind blank. Words failed me. This wasn't my first brush with death, but Damian's unhinged glee made me doubt I'd survive this time.

I forced myself to snap out of it. No. I had Liam. I had a baby growing inside me. I would fight.

"Or maybe," Damian mused, tilting his head, "you're terrified Ethan will pick your sister instead. Is that what's eating at you?"

"She's not my sister!" I snarled, fury reigniting in my veins.

His laugh was hollow, devoid of any real amusement.

"No matter. This will be entertaining. I want to watch your ex-husband shatter—because no matter who he chooses, the other dies. And that guilt? It'll destroy him." With that, he turned and left, the door slamming shut behind him.

"What do we do?" Isabella whispered.

I didn't answer.

Because Damian was right. I was afraid. Ethan had always chosen her. He'd burn the world down for Isabella—why would this time be any different?

I didn't stand a chance.

Gritting my teeth, I twisted against the ropes binding my wrists. No cameras—good. These men had underestimated us.

The coarse fibers bit into my skin, drawing blood, but I didn't stop. Time was running out.

"What the hell are you doing?" Isabella hissed, staring at me like I'd lost my mind.

"Escaping," I snapped. "Or did you forget we're on a ticking clock?"

"Ethan will come for us," she said, voice firm.

I scoffed. "Wake up. He'll choose you. I have a son and another baby to think about. I'm not sitting around waiting for Ethan to play god just because our father was stupid enough to sign a deal with the Reaper without checking who he really was!"

Her eyes widened, stunned by my outburst. Maybe it was harsh, but I was done being polite. My life—my child's life—was on the line.

And if my father had just investigated first, none of us would be here.
###Chapter 168

The morning sun painted golden streaks across the sky as Sophia stepped into the bustling café. The scent of freshly brewed coffee wrapped around her like a warm embrace.

She spotted Ethan Blackwood sitting by the window, his sharp features softened by the sunlight. His fingers tapped absently against the table, a habit she'd come to recognize as impatience.

"You're late," he remarked without looking up.

Sophia slid into the seat opposite him, setting her bag down with deliberate calm. "Traffic," she lied smoothly.

Ethan's gaze finally lifted, piercing and unreadable. "We don't have time for games, Sophia."

She arched a brow. "Then why are we here?"

A muscle in his jaw twitched. "Because you owe me answers."

The air between them crackled with tension. Around them, the café hummed with oblivious chatter, a stark contrast to the storm brewing at their table.

Sophia leaned forward, lowering her voice. "What exactly do you want to know?"

Ethan mirrored her movement, his voice a dangerous whisper. "Everything."

A shiver raced down her spine. She'd known this moment would come, but the weight of it still stole her breath.

Before she could respond, her phone buzzed. A message from Daniel Carter lit up the screen: We need to talk. Now.

Her stomach twisted.

Ethan's eyes flicked to her phone, then back to her face. "Problem?"

Sophia forced a smile. "Just business."

But the look in his eyes told her he didn't believe her.

And she wasn't sure she believed herself either.

The game was far from over.

And the stakes had never been higher.

"I can't believe you just said that about Ethan!"

"Lucky for me, because I couldn't care less what you think," I snap.

Why couldn’t she just shut up and let me focus? Every second I remained tied up, my panic grew sharper.

Isabella glares at me but finally stays silent. I exhale in relief. Now, I could concentrate on freeing my hands. If I managed that, the rest would be easy. At least, I hoped so.

I don’t know how long I struggled before giving up. My hands trembled. My wrists burned, raw and slick with blood. The more I fought against the ropes, the deeper they bit into my skin.

A heavy breath escapes me. I hated this, but I had no choice. It was either swallow my pride or risk becoming the one who didn’t make it out alive.

"I have a plan," I mutter reluctantly, turning to Isabella. It stung my ego, but survival mattered more than pride.

"Now you need my help?" she smirks. "Weren’t you just telling me to shut the hell up and that my opinion meant nothing?"

The urge to lash out was strong, but I held back. Antagonizing her now would be stupid—I needed her.

"Are you helping or not?" I demand, refusing to admit I might have been too harsh.

She studies me, blue eyes locked onto mine, weighing her options. Deciding whether to aid her worst enemy. Just as I consider taking it back, she finally speaks.

"What do you need me to do?"

Relief floods me. Maybe there was hope after all.

"I can’t untie myself, but you might be able to," I explain. "If we turn our chairs back-to-back and get close enough, we could free each other."

God, I prayed this would work. I was out of ideas.

"Fine," she says, twisting her chair toward me.

I’d considered hopping mine around, but Isabella’s method was smarter—quieter, less likely to draw attention.

After several attempts and near falls, we finally maneuvered into position.

"Hurry," I plead, fingers working frantically at her binds.

Every second that passed, I expected Damian to burst in and declare Ethan had chosen Isabella—sealing my fate.

Finally, the ropes loosened. My body relaxed slightly, but not completely. True relief wouldn’t come until we were far from this place.

I quickly untied my legs, stumbling when I stood. The ropes had cut off circulation, leaving my limbs numb.

"What now?" Isabella asks, nerves threading her voice.

I didn’t have a solid plan. We’d have to improvise.

"Now, we escape."

I moved toward the door but paused when I realized she wasn’t following.

"Are you coming?" I ask without fully turning.

"I don’t know. What if Ethan comes and we’re gone? What then?"

Just because we’d helped each other didn’t make us allies. She needed to stop waiting for others to save her.

"Listen," I say coldly, "when they realize I’m gone, they’ll take the choice from Ethan and kill you instead. Stay if you want, but I’m leaving."

With that, I turned and strode toward the door.

Cracking it open, I scanned the hallway—no guards. I pushed it wider, stepping out just as Isabella slipped in behind me.
###Chapter 169

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the hospital corridor as Sophia paced restlessly. Her fingers twisted the hem of her sweater, the fabric stretched thin from her nervous habit.

Liam sat quietly in the waiting area, his small legs swinging back and forth. He clutched a worn-out comic book, but his eyes kept darting toward the delivery room doors.

Ethan Blackwood leaned against the wall, his arms crossed. His jaw was tight, his usual composed demeanor fraying at the edges. Every time a nurse walked by, his gaze snapped up, searching for news.

A sudden cry pierced the air.

Sophia froze.

The doors swung open, and Dr. Bennett stepped out, her face breaking into a smile. "Congratulations," she said. "She's perfect."

Sophia's knees nearly gave out.

Ethan was at her side in an instant, his hand steadying her. His voice was rough with emotion. "You did it."

Liam scrambled off his chair, his comic forgotten. "Can I see her?"

Dr. Bennett nodded. "Just for a little while. She needs rest."

Inside the room, the tiny bundle in the bassinet let out a soft whimper. Sophia reached out, her fingers trembling as she brushed them over the baby's cheek.

Ethan stood beside her, his breath catching. "Iris," he murmured.

Sophia looked up at him, tears blurring her vision. "She looks like you."

Liam tugged at Ethan's sleeve. "Dad, can I hold her?"

Ethan hesitated, then carefully lifted the newborn, guiding Liam's arms into position. "Support her head," he reminded gently.

Liam's face lit up as he cradled his sister. "Hi, Iris," he whispered.

Sophia watched them, her heart so full it ached.

Then the door creaked open.

A nurse stepped in, her expression hesitant. "Mr. Blackwood? There's a call for you."

Ethan frowned. "Now?"

The nurse nodded. "They said it's urgent."

Sophia met his gaze, a flicker of unease passing between them.

Ethan pressed a kiss to her forehead. "I'll be right back."

As he left, Sophia tightened her grip on the blanket draped over her legs.

Something wasn't right.

Outside, Ethan's voice was sharp. "What do you mean, he's gone?"

Sophia strained to hear the rest, but the words were swallowed by the hum of the hospital.

Liam, oblivious, continued cooing at Iris.

Sophia forced a smile for her children, even as dread coiled in her stomach.

Because whatever was coming—it wasn't good.

I step out of the shadows and scan our surroundings. A junkyard. Perfect. The maze of rusted metal and discarded machinery offered countless hiding spots from Damien and his men.

“We need to find the exit,” I whisper to Isabella, already moving forward. “Once we’re out, we’ll be safer.”

She nods, her face pale but determined. We move cautiously, sticking to the shadows, avoiding open spaces. Every creak of metal makes my pulse spike.

“Where the hell is the damn exit?” Isabella hisses after what feels like an eternity of weaving through the wreckage.

I exhale sharply. No guards, but no exit either. Just endless piles of scrap.

“Maybe we should—”

A deafening alarm cuts me off, blaring through the yard like a death knell.

My stomach drops.

They know.

“Go!” I grab Isabella’s arm, yanking her forward. Her eyes are wide, terrified—like she’s already seeing her life unravel.

We run blindly, no plan, no direction. Just away.

I glance back to make sure she’s still with me.

Mistake.

I slam into a solid wall of muscle. Staggering, I barely catch myself before hitting the ground.

Ice floods my veins as I look up.

One of Damien’s men.

His grin is vicious as he pulls a gun, leveling it at my chest. “Did you really think escaping would be that easy?”

Isabella whimpers beside me, trembling violently.

I force a smirk. “Yes.”

He steps closer, gun unwavering. “I don’t like your attitude. Maybe I’ll just put a bullet in you and save your ex the trouble.”

No time to think.

I drive my knee up with all my strength.

He crumples with a choked scream, gun clattering to the ground. I snatch it up, flick off the safety, and fire.

Bang. Right thigh.

Bang. Left thigh.

His howls of pain echo through the yard. Blood pools beneath him. I’ve never shot anyone before, but the sight of him writhing?

Satisfying.

“Over here!”

The shout kills my brief triumph.

Gun still in hand, I grab Isabella. We barely make it ten feet before bullets rip through the air.

I shove her behind a gutted car as gunfire erupts around us.

“Goddammit, Sophia!” Isabella shouts, voice shaking. “If I die because of you, I swear I’ll haunt your ass!”

I ignore her, counting the shots.

Silence.

I drag in a ragged breath and pull her up. “Move. Now.”

We bolt—

A presence.

“Sophia!” Isabella’s scream chills my blood.

Something slams into me.

I hit the ground just as a single gunshot splits the night.
###Chapter 170

The hospital corridor stretched endlessly before Sophia, its sterile white walls closing in on her.

Her heart pounded violently against her ribs.

Liam was still in surgery.

She clutched her phone, her fingers trembling as she dialed Ethan Blackwood’s number for the fifteenth time.

No answer.

Again.

A cold dread slithered down her spine.

Where was he?

Her gaze flickered to the clock—three hours had passed since the accident.

Three hours of suffocating silence.

The waiting room door creaked open.

Daniel Carter stepped inside, his expression grim.

Sophia’s breath hitched.

“Any news?” she whispered, her voice raw.

Daniel hesitated, then shook his head.

“Not yet.”

Her knees nearly buckled.

She pressed a hand to her mouth, stifling a sob.

Liam had to be okay.

He had to.

The thought of losing him was unbearable.

A sudden vibration in her palm made her jump.

Her phone screen lit up with an unknown number.

Her pulse spiked.

She answered instantly.

“Hello?”

A chilling voice slithered through the line.

“Miss Blackwood.”

Her blood turned to ice.

She knew that voice.

Hawk.

The man who had tried to kill her before.

“What do you want?” she demanded, her voice shaking.

A low, sinister chuckle echoed in her ear.

“I have a proposition for you.”

Her grip tightened on the phone.

“If you’ve touched Liam—”

“Oh, he’s safe,” Hawk interrupted smoothly. “For now.”

Sophia’s stomach twisted.

“What do you want?” she repeated, her voice barely above a whisper.

Hawk’s tone turned deadly serious.

“Ethan Blackwood. Bring him to me. Alone.”

Her breath caught.

“Or?”

Another dark laugh.

“Or your son dies.”

The line went dead.

Sophia stood frozen, her mind racing.

Ethan was missing.

Liam’s life was on the line.

And she had no choice but to play Hawk’s game.

Her phone buzzed again.

A text.

An address.

And a timer—counting down from six hours.

Her vision blurred.

She had to find Ethan.

Before time ran out.

Before she lost everything.

"Shit, that hurts!" Isabella screams in agony, snapping me out of my daze just in time to see the man raise his gun.

I lunge for the weapon I'd dropped and fire without hesitation. He crumples to the ground. I don’t spare him a second glance—alive or dead, it doesn’t matter. Not when adrenaline is roaring through my veins and Isabella is bleeding out beside me.

"Am I dying?" she whimpers, tears welling in her eyes.

Normally, I’d tell her to stop being dramatic. But not today. Not when she shoved me out of the way and took a bullet meant for my chest.

"No, you’re not," I say firmly, assessing the damage.

The bullet hit her shoulder, and blood soaks through her blouse. My stomach twists. She could bleed out before we find help—and we’re still trapped, with enemies likely closing in.

"You’re lying!" she hisses when I press down on the wound. "If I’m not dying, why does it feel like my arm’s on fire?"

I ignore her, focusing on slowing the bleeding. Teaching first aid was part of our training, but I’m no surgeon. The bullet’s still lodged inside, and removing it could make things worse. Instead, I tear the hem of my dress and wrap it tightly around her shoulder.

"Damn it, I should’ve stayed locked in that godforsaken room," she mutters, shooting me a glare that does little to mask her pain.

"Come on. We need to keep moving," I urge, helping her up.

Fuck. Ethan is going to murder me. Not only did I drag Isabella into this mess, but now she’s been shot. Even if it was her choice to take the bullet, he won’t care. He’ll see her bleeding and blame me.

With a sigh, I adjust her weight against me. She leans heavily on my side, her right arm limp. At this pace, we won’t last long.

Time blurs—minutes or hours, I can’t tell. My legs burn, my hands shake, and my head throbs. Isabella sags forward, her strength fading with every step.

"Maybe we should rest," I pant.

"Yesss. Good idea," she slurs, nearly sending us both tumbling.

I find a shadowed corner behind an abandoned car and ease her down before collapsing beside her.

This place is a labyrinth. We’ve been running in circles since we escaped, and exhaustion gnaws at me. Right now, I don’t care if they find us. I just want painkillers, food, and sleep.

"Isabella, I don’t think we’re getting out of here," I admit.

Silence.

I turn to her. Her eyes are closed, lips slightly parted.

"Isabella?"

No answer.
###Chapter 171

The morning light filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow across the bedroom. Sophia stirred, her body still heavy with sleep.

She reached out instinctively, but the other side of the bed was cold.

Ethan had already left.

Again.

She sighed, rubbing her temples. The distance between them had grown wider than ever, and she wasn’t sure how to bridge it.

Downstairs, Liam was already at the breakfast table, his small hands gripping a spoon as he shoveled cereal into his mouth. His eyes lit up when he saw her.

"Mommy!"

The sound of his voice eased the tension in her chest. She forced a smile and ruffled his hair.

"Morning, sweetheart. Did you sleep well?"

He nodded enthusiastically, milk dribbling down his chin.

Sophia grabbed a napkin and wiped his face, her heart aching. She wished things were simpler.

Her phone buzzed on the counter. A message from Daniel.

"We need to talk."

Her stomach twisted.

She had been avoiding him since the incident at the hospital. The guilt gnawed at her, but she wasn’t ready to face him. Not yet.

The doorbell rang.

Liam perked up. "Is it Daddy?"

Sophia hesitated. Ethan wouldn’t ring the doorbell.

She walked to the door and peered through the peephole.

Her breath caught.

It wasn’t Ethan.

It was Sebastian.

Dressed in a sharp black suit, his expression unreadable.

Her fingers trembled as she unlocked the door.

"Sebastian? What are you doing here?"

He stepped inside without waiting for an invitation, his gaze sweeping over the house before landing on her.

"We have a problem."

Sophia’s pulse spiked.

"What kind of problem?"

Sebastian’s jaw tightened.

"Ethan’s in trouble."

The words hit her like a physical blow.

She gripped the doorframe to steady herself.

"What happened?"

Sebastian’s eyes darkened.

"He’s missing."

My pulse skyrockets as terror claws at my throat.

I shake Isabella, but her body sways limply. My arms shoot out just in time to catch her before she hits the dirt. Swiveling her carefully, I cradle her head against my lap. "Isabella?" I murmur, but she doesn’t stir.

My fingers tremble as I press them to her wrist, dreading the absence of a heartbeat. A ragged breath escapes me when I feel the faint rhythm beneath her skin. Weak, but there. Thank God.

Tears blur my vision. We were trapped. Isabella was bleeding out. I was exhausted, battered, and surrounded by enemies.

The tears spill over. I don’t bother wiping them away. I was so damn tired of this—of running, of fighting, of never catching a break. All I wanted was peace. Was that too much to ask?

I keep my fingers on Isabella’s pulse, clinging to that steady thump like a lifeline. We might never be close, but I refused to let her die because of me.

"Well, well." A cruel voice cuts through the silence. "Done playing hide-and-seek? Or is your little friend already dead?"

My head snaps up. A hulking man leers down at us, his eyes gleaming with malice. In that instant, my entire life flashes before my eyes.

That bravado I’d felt earlier? Gone. Vanished. I wasn’t ready to die. Not like this.

"Please," I choke out as he raises his gun.

Logically, I knew he wouldn’t kill me. Damien needed us alive for his sick plan. But logic meant nothing when staring down the barrel of a gun.

He clicks off the safety, grinning. "Boss wants you breathing," he sneers. "Doesn’t mean I can’t make you wish you weren’t."

The pure sadism in his gaze chills me to the bone. This wasn’t just some hired thug. He enjoyed this.

I squeeze my eyes shut, bracing for impact.

A gunshot rings out.

But no pain follows.

Confused, I blink my eyes open—and freeze.

Ethan stands over the man’s corpse like some dark avenger, smoke curling from his weapon.

"Ethan," I breathe, relief flooding me—until his gaze lands on Isabella’s unconscious form.

Shit.

I’d forgotten.

Now, I wasn’t sure which was worse: facing Damien’s men or Ethan’s wrath.

"She needs an ambulance," I rush out, voice barely audible. "She was shot. Lost consciousness a few minutes ago."

Silence.

His expression is granite, and that terrifies me more than any gun ever could. Because when Isabella wakes up and tells him she took a bullet meant for me?

I’m dead.

I glance between her pale face and Ethan’s stormy eyes. Rage radiates off him in waves.

As I watch the fury twist his features, Isabella’s words echo in my mind: We should’ve stayed in that damn room.

For once, I wished I’d listened.
###Chapter 172

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow over the bedroom. Sophia stretched lazily, her body still humming with the remnants of last night’s passion.

Ethan’s side of the bed was empty, but the lingering warmth told her he hadn’t been gone long.

She reached for her phone, scrolling through messages. One from Isabella stood out—urgent, demanding a call.

Before she could dial, the door creaked open.

Liam peeked in, his dark curls tousled from sleep. "Mom, can we have pancakes?"

Sophia smiled. "Of course, sweetheart. Give me ten minutes."

As she dressed, her mind wandered back to Ethan. The way he had looked at her last night—intense, possessive, as if she were the only woman in the world.

A shiver ran down her spine.

Downstairs, the scent of coffee filled the air. Ethan stood by the stove, flipping pancakes with effortless grace.

He glanced over his shoulder, his gaze smoldering. "Morning."

Her breath hitched. "Morning."

Liam tugged at her sleeve. "Mom, can we add chocolate chips?"

Ethan smirked. "Already did."

The domesticity of it all should have felt strange. But it didn’t.

Her phone buzzed again. Isabella.

Sophia excused herself, stepping onto the patio. The moment she answered, her sister’s frantic voice filled her ear.

"You need to come to the hospital. Now."

Her blood ran cold. "What happened?"

"It’s Dad. He collapsed."

The pancakes forgotten, Sophia grabbed her keys. Ethan was already at her side, his expression grim.

"I’ll drive."

The world blurred as they sped through the streets.

William Sterling lay in a hospital bed, pale and fragile. Victoria clutched his hand, her face streaked with tears.

Sophia’s knees nearly gave out. "Dad?"

His eyes fluttered open. "Sophia… I need to tell you something."

Her heart pounded.

"About your mother… and the night she died."

The room spun.

Ethan’s grip on her waist tightened, steadying her.

William’s voice was barely a whisper. "It wasn’t an accident."

The words hung in the air, heavy with decades of secrets.

Sophia’s vision tunneled.

Then everything went black.

The terror that gripped me when I saw that bastard pressing a gun to her temple was indescribable. Sophia trembled, tears streaking down her face. Her pleas for mercy echoed in my ears, but I knew he wouldn’t grant them.

When she closed her eyes—resigned to her fate—it nearly shattered me. If I hadn’t known she was exhausted, I would’ve kept the bastard alive just to make him suffer in ways he couldn’t imagine.

"She needs a doctor, Ethan," she whispered weakly as I dropped to my knees in front of her.

I had already texted Sebastian. The ambulance would arrive any minute. It wasn’t that I didn’t care about Isabella—I did. But Sophia came first.

Gently, I cupped her face. Her cheek was swollen, her eye already darkening with a bruise. A split lip marred her soft skin.

Rage coiled inside me at the thought of someone daring to hurt her.

"Who hit you?" My jaw clenched. "Was it Damian?"

She flinched when my fingers brushed her bruised cheek. Damn it. Her pain twisted something inside me. I wanted blood.

"It doesn’t matter," she murmured, trying to stand. "We need to get Isabella to a hospital."

I pressed her back down, ignoring her protest as I examined her. Her wrists were raw, her ankles swollen and bruised.

Every injury fueled my fury. She shouldn’t have suffered like this. Not now. Not ever. And definitely not while carrying my child.

"Ethan, are you even listening?" Her voice was strained with exhaustion.

"I heard you," I said. "The ambulance is coming. Now tell me who hurt you."

She exhaled shakily, sagging against the car.

"One of Damian’s men. He hit me when I talked back."

"Describe him."

I would find him. No one laid a hand on Sophia and walked away. He’d regret the day he was born.

"It doesn’t matter," she muttered. "When I escaped, he found us first. I kneed him in the groin and shot him in both legs."

A smirk tugged at my lips. I loved this side of her—fierce, unbroken. She wasn’t taking anyone’s cruelty anymore.

Before I could ask why she’d risked escaping alone, sirens wailed in the distance. Sebastian, Nathan, and the paramedics arrived moments later.

They lifted Isabella from Sophia’s lap, strapping her onto a stretcher.

"What happened?" a medic asked.

Sophia hesitated, then answered quietly.

"She was shot during the escape. I tried to stop the bleeding, but she lost consciousness." Her gaze stayed fixed on Isabella. "Will she be okay?"

That was Sophia—even after everything Isabella had done, she still worried. She was too damn good.

"Her pulse is weak, but she’ll pull through," the medic assured her.

They wheeled Isabella away.

"Are you all right, Sophia?" Nathan asked, concern etched on his face.

"I’m fine," she whispered, struggling to rise. "Go. Be with her. She needs you more."

He kissed her cheek—a rare moment of affection she didn’t resist, too drained to push him away.

Once he left, I signaled Sebastian to follow.

"Need help?" I asked, watching her sway slightly as she tried to stand.
###Chapter 173

The crisp morning air carried the scent of freshly brewed coffee as Sophia stepped onto the balcony of her penthouse. Below, the city hummed with life, but her thoughts were elsewhere—on the man who had once been her everything.

Ethan Blackwood.

Even the mere thought of his name sent a shiver down her spine.

She tightened the silk robe around her, the fabric whispering against her skin. The past few weeks had been a whirlwind of emotions—anger, regret, and something dangerously close to longing.

Her phone buzzed on the glass table. A message from Isabella.

"Heard from Liam. He’s asking for you."

Sophia’s breath hitched. Liam, her son, the one bright spot in the wreckage of her marriage. She hadn’t seen him in weeks, not since the explosive argument with Ethan that had left them both raw and bleeding.

She typed back quickly. "Tell him I’ll call tonight."

But the guilt gnawed at her. She should be there. She wanted to be there.

The doorbell rang, startling her.

She frowned. No one visited this early.

Padding barefoot across the marble floor, she peered through the peephole—and froze.

Daniel Carter stood on the other side, his dark eyes intense, his jaw set. The man who had been her solace in the storm, the one who had promised her a fresh start.

But why was he here now?

She opened the door slowly. "Daniel?"

His expression was unreadable. "We need to talk."

Her pulse spiked. "About what?"

He stepped closer, his voice low. "Ethan’s in trouble."

The words struck like a physical blow.

Sophia’s hands trembled. "What kind of trouble?"

Daniel’s gaze never wavered. "The kind that could get him killed."

The world tilted.

She gripped the doorframe for support. "Tell me everything."

And as Daniel spoke, the carefully constructed walls around her heart began to crumble.

Because no matter how much she tried to deny it, Ethan still owned a piece of her soul.

And now, he might be lost to her forever.

"Please," she murmurs, her voice drained as her weary eyes meet mine.

Without hesitation, I scoop her into my arms, cradling her against my chest as I start toward the car.

"I only asked for help standing, not a full escort," she protests weakly, lacking her usual sharpness. The exhaustion in her tone speaks volumes.

I ignore her complaint, tightening my hold. Having her this close feels unnervingly right—like the stars themselves had shifted to make this moment possible. If eternity meant holding her like this, I'd surrender to it without hesitation.

As we near the car, a thought claws at me. I've never let myself be this vulnerable with her before—never allowed embraces, never lingered in her touch. Always holding back. Would it have always felt like this if I had? Like she was the fragment of myself I'd been searching for?

Just as I reach the car, Gregory steps into my path.

"What?" I snarl, barely restraining the urge to lash out. Couldn't he see what—who—I was carrying?

"We took down most of the Reapers, but Damien slipped away again," he reports grimly.

Rage simmers under my skin. That bastard's evasion is a personal insult. Every second he remains free is another threat to everyone I love.

"Find him," I bite out before turning away.

Gently, I lower Sophia into the passenger seat, buckling her in before sliding behind the wheel. The hospital isn't far.

"Where are we going?" she asks around a yawn.

"You need to be checked. For you and the baby."

She nods, leaning back against the seat. By the time we arrive, she's already asleep.

Parking, I brush a hand over her cheek to wake her. "We're here."

Before she can move, I lift her again, carrying her through the doors. Nurses swarm us instantly, pushing a wheelchair forward.

"Sir, we'll take care of her. We'll update you soon," one assures me when I hesitate to let go.

Reluctantly, I set her down.

"Call my parents," Sophia whispers before they wheel her away.

The second she's out of sight, I do exactly that—short, clipped, demanding their immediate presence. Next, I check on Liam. The moment Sebastian alerted me, I'd sent my parents to retrieve him. Confirming his safety, I head to the waiting area where Nathan, Victoria, and Sebastian sit.

"Any updates?" I ask, dropping into a chair.

"Not yet," Nathan answers.

"How is she? Where is she now?" Victoria frets.

"They're running tests to ensure everything's stable," I explain.

Silence settles over us. Being here drags up memories—the aftermath of William's death, the hurricane of emotions when Isabella reappeared after nine years. For a heartbeat, I'd been transported back to when she was my entire world. So lost in the past, I hadn't even noticed Sophia walking away.

This place also reminds me of the gunshot—Sophia standing beside me, yet I'd lunged for Isabella instead. That night birthed a different Sophia. The woman I knew had vanished, replaced by someone colder, harder. I don't blame her. I'd have done the same. That moment was her awakening—proof I wasn't worth her heart.

Pushing to my feet, I pace.

Somewhere along the way, everything changed. Now, she wants nothing from me. Every past decision I'd believed justified now stands as a wall between us. My every move is suspect in her eyes. Every effort I make crumbles. And trust? That bridge is ash.
###Chapter 174

The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting golden streaks across the bedroom. Sophia stirred, her fingers brushing against the empty space beside her. The sheets were cold.

She sat up, rubbing her eyes. The house was silent, save for the distant hum of the city waking up.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Daniel.

"Good morning. Can we talk today?"

Her heart skipped. She hadn’t seen him since the incident at the hospital.

Before she could reply, another notification popped up—Isabella.

"Call me ASAP. It’s about Liam."

Sophia’s breath hitched. She dialed immediately.

Isabella picked up on the first ring. "He’s gone."

"What?" Sophia’s grip tightened around the phone.

"Liam. He left a note. Said he needed time alone."

Sophia was already out of bed, pulling on a sweater. "Where would he go?"

"I don’t know, but Ethan’s freaking out."

Sophia’s mind raced. Liam had been distant lately, but this?

She grabbed her keys and headed for the door.

The city streets blurred past as she drove. Her phone buzzed again—Daniel. She ignored it.

The Blackwood estate loomed ahead, gates swinging open as she approached. Ethan stood on the front steps, his face pale.

"Any news?" Sophia asked, stepping out of the car.

Ethan shook his head. "Nothing. His phone’s off."

Sophia’s stomach twisted. "We need to find him."

Ethan’s jaw clenched. "I already have people looking."

She studied him—the dark circles under his eyes, the tension in his shoulders. He was just as scared as she was.

Then her phone buzzed again.

Unknown number.

She answered.

A familiar voice sent chills down her spine.

"Miss me?"

Sophia froze.

Sebastian.

Ethan’s twin brother. The man who’d nearly destroyed them all.

Her voice was barely a whisper. "What do you want?"

His laugh was cold. "Oh, just a little reunion. And I brought a guest."

In the background, a muffled voice cried out.

Liam.

Sophia’s blood ran cold.

Sebastian’s tone turned deadly serious. "Come alone. Or the kid pays."

The line went dead.

Ethan’s eyes locked onto hers. "What happened?"

Sophia swallowed hard.

"We have a problem."

The game had just changed.

I can’t lie to myself any longer. I fucking want her. But with everything I’ve done, I doubt she’ll ever look at me the same way again. The love that once burned in her eyes for me is gone—replaced by something colder, something resigned. The only reason she tolerates my presence now is because of Liam.

"Mr. Blackwood."

The nurse’s voice snaps me out of my spiraling thoughts.

I lift my head, meeting her steady gaze.

"How is she?" The words rush out, raw with desperation.

"She’s stable, and so is the baby. We’re keeping her for observation—she was severely dehydrated when she arrived."

A sharp inhale comes from behind me. Shit. Victoria didn’t know about Sophia’s pregnancy. Now she does. I ignore her, focusing solely on the nurse.

"Can I see her?"

She nods and leads me down the hall. The door clicks open, and I step inside before it shuts softly behind me.

Sophia lies still, an IV drip feeding into her arm. Bandages wrap around her wrists, a thin sheet covers her from the waist down, and the gash on her lip has been stitched closed.

"How’s Isabella?"

Her first question isn’t about herself. Not about the baby. Not even about the pain she must be in.

Damn this woman. She’s too good.

"No updates yet," I admit, sinking into the chair beside her bed. My fingers twitch with the need to touch her, to reassure myself she’s really here. "But she’ll pull through."

A tear slips down her cheek. "I’m so sorry," she whispers. "I never meant for her to get hurt. I just wanted to get away. If I’d known she’d be shot—"

I can’t hold back anymore. My hand closes over hers, warm and small against my palm.

"Why did you want to escape?"

The question has haunted me since I found her. Didn’t she trust me to come for her? To protect her?

She stares at me like I’ve lost my mind. "Why would I stay? The second Damian gave you that ultimatum, I knew where I stood. Isabella will always come first for you. I know that."

Her words gut me.

If seeing her hurt wrecked me, hearing this obliterated what was left. But how could I blame her for believing it?

Hadn’t I spent years hammering it into her? That Isabella was my world. That she meant everything, while Sophia meant nothing. I’d carved that truth into her mind, her heart, her soul.

And now I had the audacity to be hurt that she believed me?

The pain inside me is unbearable. My grip on her hand tightens without meaning to.

"Ethan?" Her voice is soft with concern. She tries to pull away.

I loosen my hold but don’t let go. Right now, she’s the only thing keeping me from drowning in the mess I’ve made.

"I was coming for you, Sophia. From the moment Damian gave that ultimatum, you were my choice." The confession tears free, raw and unfiltered. "I know it makes me a monster, but I would’ve let Isabella die if it meant saving you."

Her eyes widen in shock.

But I meant every word.

There was never a choice to make.

Because she’s been my only choice for a long, long time.

She owns me.

Even if she doesn’t know it yet.
###Chapter 175

The moment Sophia stepped into the dimly lit room, her pulse quickened.

The air was thick with tension, heavy enough to choke on.

Ethan Blackwood stood by the window, his silhouette sharp against the moonlight. His jaw was clenched, his fingers curled into fists at his sides.

She swallowed hard.

This wasn’t the reunion she had imagined.

"You shouldn’t be here," he said, his voice low and rough.

Sophia lifted her chin. "I had to come."

His gaze flickered to hers, dark and unreadable. "Why?"

"Because we need to talk."

A bitter laugh escaped him. "Now you want to talk?"

She flinched but held her ground. "Liam misses you."

Ethan’s expression hardened. "Don’t use him as leverage."

"I’m not." She took a step forward. "I’m telling you the truth."

Silence stretched between them, suffocating.

Then, a sharp knock at the door shattered the moment.

Sebastian strode in, his usual smirk absent. "We have a problem."

Ethan didn’t look away from Sophia. "What?"

"Damian Slade’s men are outside."

Sophia’s breath hitched.

Ethan’s eyes narrowed. "How many?"

"Enough to be a problem."

Sophia’s mind raced. "We need to leave."

Ethan finally turned away from her, grabbing his coat. "Stay behind me."

She didn’t argue.

As they moved through the darkened halls, Sophia’s heart pounded in her chest.

She had come for answers.

But now, survival was the only thing that mattered.

The night was far from over.

And danger was closer than ever.

“W-what?” My voice trembles as I stare at Ethan in utter disbelief.

There was no way I heard him right. The Ethan I knew would have moved heaven and earth for Isabella—even if it meant sacrificing me.

My pulse races as I search his expressionless face for any sign of deception.

“You heard me, Sophia,” he repeats, his tone steady, unshaken. “If it came down to it, I would have let her die to save you.”

At first, I thought he was lying just to ease my guilt. Who wouldn’t? After all, what woman wants to hear that the man she loved for nearly a decade would choose another over her?

I assumed he was just sparing my feelings. But the raw honesty in his eyes told a different story. Ethan had never been one to soften the truth for my sake. He had always been brutally direct—why would he start lying now?

I exhale sharply and pull my hands free from his grasp. The warmth of his touch was too much, stirring emotions I wasn’t ready to face.

“You don’t mean that,” I finally say, my voice low. “Isabella is the woman you’ve loved since you first understood what love was. You’ve spent years devoted to her. How can you stand there and claim you’d sacrifice her for me?”

His brows knit together, frustration darkening his stormy gray eyes. He opens his mouth to argue, but I cut him off.

“I was nothing to you from the beginning. Remember? You hated me, Ethan. You despised me for years. So what changed? How can you suddenly decide I matter more than your precious Isabella? None of this makes sense. You don’t just wake up one day and stop hating someone.”

I sink back against the pillow, exhaustion weighing me down. Every word I spoke was the truth. A decade’s worth of bitterness and resentment doesn’t vanish overnight.

Strong emotions don’t disappear easily. I knew that better than anyone. Hadn’t I spent years trying to bury my love for him? I’d hidden it well, but it had never truly gone away. And I knew it would take time—so much time—before I could finally be free of it.

Ethan starts to speak, but I’m done. I don’t want to hear it. I don’t want his explanations, his justifications. Not when I’ve spent years believing he loathed me.

Some might wonder why I’d push him away now. Isn’t this what I’d secretly wanted? For him to realize his mistake, to beg for forgiveness?

But the truth was, I didn’t know how to handle this version of him. His sudden shift left me wary, suspicious. Part of me wanted to believe him, to let go of the past. But the other part—the part that had been hurt too many times—didn’t trust this change.

It felt like waiting for the other shoe to drop.

“No, Ethan,” I interrupt firmly. “I’m grateful you saved me, but you should leave. Go to Isabella. That’s where you belong. You’ve waited years to be with her—don’t throw it away now. What we had was a mistake. Nine years of misery. It’s time we both found happiness. Yours is with her. And mine… mine is with my children.”

I see the protest in his eyes, the storm brewing in his gaze. For a moment, I brace myself for an argument. But it never comes.

Instead, he slumps back in his chair with a heavy sigh.

“Fine,” he mutters, his voice rough. “I’ll leave you alone… for now.”

He stands, and I think that’s it—that he’ll walk out without another word. But then he leans down, pressing a soft kiss to my forehead before I can react.

And just like that, he’s gone, the door clicking shut behind him.

I stare after him, stunned.

Ethan never walked away when he didn’t want to. He never yielded. Yet tonight, he did.

As I lie there, strength slowly returning, my mind races over his words.

Could I believe him?

This was Ethan. The same man who once told me I’d never compare to Isabella. The same man who made sure I knew I was nothing to him.

“What the hell is happening?” I whisper to the empty room.

I might have believed another man if he claimed he’d choose me over Isabella.

But not Ethan.

Never Ethan.
###Chapter 176

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the hospital corridor as Sophia paced restlessly outside the delivery room. Her fingers twisted the hem of her sweater, nails digging into the fabric. Every muffled cry from inside sent a fresh wave of anxiety through her.

Ethan Blackwood stood nearby, his jaw clenched, eyes fixed on the closed door. His usual composure had cracked, revealing the tension beneath. He hadn’t spoken since they arrived, but the rigid set of his shoulders betrayed his unease.

Isabella rushed down the hall, her heels clicking against the tile. "Any news?" she asked breathlessly, clutching Sophia’s arm.

Sophia shook her head. "Not yet."

The door swung open, and Dr. Bennett stepped out, her expression unreadable. Sophia’s heart lurched.

"Everything’s fine," the doctor said quickly, noticing their panic. "But we’ve had a minor complication. The baby’s heartbeat dropped for a moment, but it’s stabilized now."

Sophia exhaled sharply, her knees nearly buckling. Ethan’s hand shot out to steady her, his grip firm.

"We’re monitoring closely," Dr. Bennett continued. "It shouldn’t be much longer."

As the doctor disappeared back inside, Sophia leaned against the wall, her pulse still racing. Ethan’s phone buzzed, but he ignored it, his attention locked on the door.

Isabella squeezed Sophia’s hand. "She’s going to be okay."

Sophia nodded, but the fear lingered.

Then, a sharp cry pierced the air—strong, clear, unmistakable.

Sophia’s breath caught.

Moments later, Dr. Bennett reappeared, smiling this time. "Congratulations. You have a beautiful, healthy daughter."

Tears spilled down Sophia’s cheeks as relief crashed over her. Ethan’s rigid posture finally relaxed, his eyes softening.

"Can we see her?" Sophia asked, voice trembling.

"Of course," the doctor said. "Just give us a few minutes to clean her up."

As they waited, Ethan’s phone buzzed again. This time, he glanced at it, his expression darkening.

Sophia frowned. "What is it?"

He hesitated, then pocketed the phone. "Nothing important."

But the tension had returned to his shoulders, sharper than before.

Sophia’s stomach twisted.

Something was wrong.

How could he possibly expect me to believe him now? For nine long years, he—along with everyone else—had drilled into my head that I was worthless. That I meant nothing to him. So how could he suddenly flip the script and think I’d just accept it without question?

My mind was a storm of unanswered questions, each one twisting my thoughts into knots. But I shoved them aside. Whatever was going on in Ethan Blackwood’s head wasn’t my problem anymore. We were done. It wasn’t my job to decipher him.

Exhaustion dragged me under before I could stop it, and I fell into a deep sleep.

When I woke, my parents were there, each holding one of my hands. They looked just as drained as I felt, but their presence wrapped around me like a warm blanket. For the first time in years, I felt truly loved.

This was what I had yearned for from Ethan and the Sterlings. And now that I had it, the emotions were overwhelming.

A soft sound escaped me, and they both looked up.

"Sophia," Mom whispered, her voice thick with tears. "How are you feeling?"

My eyes burned. I blinked hard, but the tears spilled anyway.

"I love you both so much," I choked out. "Thank you for being everything I ever dreamed of."

"Oh, darling," Mom said, her own tears glistening. "You have no idea how long I’ve waited to hear you say that."

"We love you too, sweetheart," Dad added, squeezing my hand. "More than words can express."

I let the tears fall as I soaked in their embrace, surrounded by the love I’d craved for so long.

The moment was interrupted when the door opened, and a nurse stepped in.

"Ready for discharge, Sophia?" she asked with a kind smile.

Relief washed over me. The doctors had assured me the drugs I’d inhaled hadn’t harmed the baby. My son was safe.

"Yes," I said, smiling back. "I can’t wait to hold him."

Ethan had told me our son was with his parents. I planned to pick him up on the way home. After today, I didn’t want to let him out of my sight.

"Great. Just stop by reception when you’re ready," the nurse said before leaving.

Mom helped me change into fresh clothes while Dad handled the paperwork. They insisted on taking care of everything, wanting me to rest.

As I waited, I spotted the Sterlings—Nathan, Victoria, Sebastian, and Ethan. My breath hitched. Steeling myself, I walked toward them, unsure what I was doing but needing to know about Isabella.

They turned to me as I approached, the tension thick. It felt like high school all over again—the awkward outsider approaching the untouchable elite.

"I just wanted to ask how Isabella is," I said, shifting nervously.

Silence stretched until Victoria stood and pulled me into a hug. I froze. She’d never hugged me before. It felt wrong. My arms stayed stiff at my sides.

Nathan was the one who answered. "She’s okay. Just out of surgery."

I nodded. What else was there to say?

Victoria released me when she realized I wasn’t returning the embrace. Tears shimmered in her eyes as she reached for my cheek, but I stepped back.

"I’m glad you’re safe, Sophia," she said, voice breaking. "So thankful both my daughters are okay."

I wanted to snap that I wasn’t her daughter—not anymore. But before I could, Mom’s voice called from behind.

"Sweetheart? It’s time to go."

Victoria flinched, but I didn’t care.

My gaze swept over them one last time, lingering on Ethan for only a second before I looked away.

"Tell Isabella I’m grateful for what she did," I said, then turned and walked to my parents.

Dad wrapped an arm around me, and Mom took my hand. I could feel eyes burning into my back, but I refused to turn around.

I wouldn’t acknowledge the emotion I’d seen in Ethan’s eyes—the one that looked like love. Because that couldn’t be real.

Ethan Blackwood only loved one woman. And her name was Isabella.
###Chapter 177

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Sophia stirred beneath the silk sheets.

Her phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand.

She reached for it, squinting at the screen.

A message from Daniel.

Her breath hitched.

"We need to talk. Meet me at the café near the precinct at noon."

Her fingers hovered over the keyboard.

What could he want now?

She exhaled sharply and typed a quick reply.

"Fine. Noon."

The weight of uncertainty settled in her chest.

Downstairs, Liam was already at the breakfast table, shoveling cereal into his mouth with the enthusiasm only a child could muster.

"Morning, Mom!" he chirped, milk dribbling down his chin.

She smiled despite herself, grabbing a napkin to wipe his face.

"Slow down, sweetheart. You’ll choke."

Ethan stood by the counter, pouring coffee into a travel mug.

His gaze flicked to her, unreadable.

"Going somewhere?" she asked, trying to sound casual.

"Meeting with a client," he replied curtly.

The tension between them was thick enough to cut with a knife.

She bit her lip, debating whether to say more.

But he was already striding toward the door.

"See you tonight," he muttered before disappearing into the garage.

The silence that followed was deafening.

Liam, oblivious, slurped the last of his milk.

"Can Jacob come over after school?"

Sophia forced a smile.

"Of course, baby."

Her phone buzzed again.

This time, it was Isabella.

"Call me ASAP. It’s important."

Her stomach twisted.

What now?

She excused herself and stepped into the hallway, dialing her sister’s number.

Isabella picked up on the first ring.

"Sophia, we have a problem."

Her voice was tight, urgent.

Sophia’s grip on the phone tightened.

"What is it?"

"It’s about Ethan."

A cold dread slithered down her spine.

"What about him?"

Isabella hesitated.

"I think he’s hiding something."

Sophia’s pulse spiked.

"What do you mean?"

"I can’t explain over the phone. Meet me at my place in an hour."

The line went dead.

Sophia stared at the screen, her mind racing.

First Daniel, now Isabella.

Something was wrong.

Terribly wrong.

And she had a sinking feeling it was all connected.

She glanced at the clock.

Two hours until her meeting with Daniel.

Plenty of time to find out what her sister knew.

She hurried upstairs to get dressed.

Whatever was coming, she needed to be ready.

Because this time, the storm wouldn’t pass quietly.

This time, it would destroy everything in its path.

Two days had passed since Isabella and I were taken. The police had hunted for Damian Slade, but he'd vanished like smoke. Those of his men they'd caught refused to talk.

Fear had become my shadow since then. I couldn’t shake the dread of it happening again. Worse—being targeted for something I had no part in.

"Mom, can I play video games?" Liam’s voice pulled me back to the present.

I’d thrown myself into chores, desperate to quiet my racing thoughts. Now, folding laundry was the last task left. After this, I’d have nothing to distract me.

"Sure. What time did Hunter say he’d be here?"

Those two were inseparable now. School, games, everything—they did it together. Their bond reminded me of the one Ethan, Sebastian, and Tristan had shared since childhood.

"Around three."

"Okay. I’ll make snacks for you both."

He kissed my cheek. "You’re the best."

Then he was gone, and silence swallowed me again.

For days, my mind had been a storm. Even sleep brought no relief.

Everything felt tangled. Especially where Ethan was concerned. He’d called, but I couldn’t bring myself to speak to him. Instead, I handed the phone to Liam. I wasn’t ready—not for him, not for this sudden shift in him.

His behavior these past months made no sense. How could I matter now when I hadn’t for nine years? What had changed?

Nothing. I was still Sophia. The same woman whose love he’d rejected over and over.

If this had happened years ago, I’d have leaped at the chance. But now? Too much had been said. Too much broken. Some wounds never heal. Some words can’t be unsaid.

But isn’t this what you wanted? A whisper in my mind. For him to see you. Want you.

I couldn’t deny it. Once, I’d dreamed of Ethan craving me the way I’d craved him. But that dream was dead. Buried by the woman I’d become—the one who knew love wasn’t enough.

Hurt was stronger. It shattered you until you were nothing but fragments. And some things, once broken, could never be fixed.

Falling for whatever game Ethan was playing would be foolish. He’d destroyed me once. I wouldn’t let it happen again.

Protecting my heart and being there for my children was all that mattered now. The love around me—even if it wasn’t romantic—had to be enough.

Fairy tales were lies. Ethan and Daniel had taught me that.

A knock at the door jerked me from my thoughts. I checked the time—nearly three. I’d been lost inside my head for over an hour.

I stood, sighing. It was probably Hunter. I’d make their snacks, then collapse into a nap.

But when I opened the door, Hunter wasn’t alone.

Lucas Montgomery stood beside him.

"Hey," I managed after hugging Hunter.

The boy didn’t wait for an invitation. He bolted upstairs the second I let go.

Leaving Lucas and me standing there.

Awkward. Silent.

Staring.
###Chapter 178

The morning sun cast golden streaks across the bedroom as Sophia stirred awake.

Her phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand.

She reached for it, blinking against the brightness of the screen.

A message from Daniel.

"We need to talk. It's urgent."

Her stomach twisted.

She hadn't heard from him in days—not since their last argument.

Throwing back the covers, she sat up, rubbing her temples.

The weight of everything pressed down on her.

Liam.

Ethan.

The secrets she still carried.

A soft knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

"Mom?" Liam’s voice was hesitant.

She forced a smile. "Come in, sweetheart."

He pushed the door open, his expression uncertain. "Are you okay?"

Sophia exhaled. "Just tired."

Liam hesitated before stepping closer. "Dad called. He wants to see me today."

Her fingers tightened around the phone.

Ethan hadn’t mentioned anything to her.

Again.

"Did he say why?" she asked carefully.

Liam shook his head. "Just that it’s important."

Sophia’s pulse quickened.

Ethan had been distant lately—more than usual.

And now this.

She forced another smile. "Okay. We’ll figure it out."

Liam nodded but didn’t look convinced.

As he left, Sophia stared at her phone again.

Daniel’s message glared back at her.

Urgent.

She knew she couldn’t avoid him forever.

But right now, she had bigger problems.

Ethan was up to something.

And she needed to find out what.

The last time I saw him was when he visited weeks ago. Hunter comes over almost daily, and Liam occasionally visits their place, but Callum? It's like he's been actively avoiding me for some reason.

When I spot him shifting awkwardly on my porch, clearly debating whether to knock, I raise a brow. "You coming in or just gonna stand there all day?"

He hesitates, then nods. "Yeah, if that's okay."

I step aside, and he crosses the threshold cautiously, as if expecting the floor to give way beneath him.

Leading him to the kitchen, I gesture toward the island. "Sit. I’m just fixing the boys something to eat."

A beat of silence stretches between us before he finally speaks. "Heard what happened to you. Just wanted to check if you were alright."

Of course he had. News traveled fast in this city. Someone had leaked it, and by sundown, Isabella and I were headline material. No one knew I was a Prescott—I preferred it that way. The scrutiny that came with the name wasn’t something I was ready for. As far as the world was concerned, I was still a Sterling, and now everyone was speculating why someone would target both Sterling sisters.

"Uh—thanks," I mutter, the awkwardness thickening the air.

"How’s the face?"

"Better."

The swelling had faded, leaving only a stubborn bruise blooming across my cheekbone.

Another stretch of silence. I resisted the urge to fidget. Awkwardness always made my skin prickle, like I was standing on uneven ground.

Then, out of nowhere—

"I’m sorry." His voice is rough, cutting through the tension.

I blink. "For what?"

"The way I’ve treated you. It wasn’t fair. You’ve been nothing but kind to me and my kid, and I just…" He trails off, but the weight of his words lingers.

I stare at him, stunned. This wasn’t the conversation I’d expected when I let him in.

"You have to understand," he continues, voice low, "I haven’t had the best experiences when it comes to… us."

A realization clicks. "Let me guess. Hunter’s mom did a number on you, and not just because she’s gone, right?"

The flicker of pain in his eyes is answer enough. Whoever she was, she’d wrecked him—badly. And from the look of it, she was still wrecking him, even now. He was drowning in it, barely keeping his head above water.

"Yeah," he admits, voice barely audible. "But I don’t wanna talk about it. It’s… too fucking painful."

Something in my chest tightens. Maybe it’s the loneliness radiating off him. Maybe it’s because I see too much of myself in him—the way pain becomes a second skin. Either way, I want to pull him out of it.

I can’t promise healing. Hell, I’m still a work in progress myself. But I know you can learn to live with the hurt instead of letting it suffocate you. Callum hasn’t figured that out yet. He’s not living—just surviving. And that’s no way to exist, especially when you’ve got a kid depending on you.

"Look, Callum… I get it. More than you know. So I’m accepting your apology, and I’m offering you something better—friendship."

He eyes me skeptically before giving a slow, reluctant nod.

I don’t know much about him yet, but one thing’s clear—he’s isolated. No support system. And that’s exactly what he needs. Someone to pull him out of the darkness.

Isn’t that what happened to me? Scarlett and Daniel barged into my life and forced me to see there was more to living than just surviving. Yeah, Daniel screwed up, but I’ll always be grateful for the way he showed me light existed beyond the pain.

"Friends?" I extend my hand.

A ghost of a smile touches his lips as he takes it. "Friends."

But even as our hands clasp, unease coils in my chest. It’s not danger I sense—just inevitability. Callum didn’t move here by accident. He’s got secrets, and when they finally surface, everything’s going to shift.
###Chapter 179

The moment Sophia stepped into the dimly lit hospital room, her breath caught in her throat.

Liam lay motionless on the bed, his small frame swallowed by sterile white sheets.

The rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor filled the silence, each pulse a fragile reminder of life.

Sophia’s fingers trembled as she reached for his hand, cold and limp beneath her touch.

This wasn’t supposed to happen.

She had left him for just a few hours—just long enough to handle the emergency at the office.

Now, guilt twisted like a knife in her chest.

The door creaked open behind her.

Ethan Blackwood stood there, his usually composed expression shattered. Dark circles shadowed his eyes, and his jaw was clenched tight.

"You came," he said, voice rough.

Sophia didn’t trust herself to speak. She just nodded.

Ethan moved closer, his presence both a comfort and a torment.

"The doctors say it was an allergic reaction," he murmured, staring at Liam’s pale face. "But he’s never had allergies before."

Sophia’s stomach dropped.

Something wasn’t right.

She glanced at the IV drip beside the bed, the clear liquid flowing steadily into Liam’s veins.

A memory flickered—Dr. Bennett mentioning a new medication last week.

Her pulse spiked.

"Ethan," she whispered urgently. "Did they change his medication?"

His gaze snapped to hers, realization dawning.

Before he could respond, the heart monitor let out a piercing alarm.

Liam’s body jerked violently.

Sophia screamed.

Nurses rushed in, shoving them aside as they worked frantically.

Ethan gripped Sophia’s shoulders, his fingers digging in.

"This wasn’t an accident," he growled, eyes burning with fury.

And in that moment, Sophia knew—

Someone had tried to kill their son.

The boredom was crushing. Absolutely soul-crushing. Weekends were bearable because Liam was home, but weekdays? Pure torture.

Scarlett and Natalie were busy with their jobs all day. So were my parents. I'd hired Elizabeth to manage The Hope Foundation's daily operations. Even if I dropped by, there’d be nothing for me to do except maybe sign a few documents.

Over the past week, we’d grown close with Lucas Montgomery. I learned he owned a construction company, started two years ago, and it was thriving. Which meant he, too, was unavailable during the day.

I was so bored I actually considered going back to work. At five months pregnant, I still had time before the baby arrived. But instead, I grabbed my phone and dialed.

"Hello, Mrs. Delaney! How are you?" I asked brightly.

We lived in the same neighborhood, and she’d called me a few days ago. Her high school daughter was failing biology, and she’d asked if I could tutor her.

"I’m wonderful, dear! So glad to hear from you. And you?" Her cheerful voice made me smile.

"I’m great, thanks." I hesitated. "I was calling to see if you’re still interested in the tutoring?"

I prayed she hadn’t found someone else. Though even if she had, other parents had reached out too.

"Oh, absolutely! It’s been stressing me out. I admit, I’ve been praying you’d change your mind."

When she first asked, I’d just started my leave. I’d refused, not realizing how mind-numbingly dull staying home would be.

"Perfect. How about after school? She can come to my place."

Afternoons worked fine. Maybe I could also help with our discreet side business. I couldn’t be publicly involved, but research? That I could do. While Scarlett and Natalie focused on their jobs, I could scout products.

"That’s perfect. Will you charge weekly or per session?" she asked, still upbeat.

"It’s free, Mrs. Delaney. I’m doing this to pass the time."

Silence. For a moment, I thought she’d hung up.

"Are… are you serious?" she finally stammered.

"Completely. Have her come by today, and we’ll start right away."

I didn’t need the money. Between liquid assets and investments, my next three generations could live comfortably.

Teaching was a passion, not a paycheck.

"O-okay. Thank you so much! She’ll be there after school," she said, still stunned.

"You’re welcome."

After hanging up, I called three more parents who’d asked for tutoring. Their reactions were identical—shocked disbelief when I said it was free. They kept asking if I was sure.

By the third call, it hit me: they knew nothing about me except that I was a teacher. We lived in a middle-class neighborhood. Unlike the elite, who thrived on gossip, these people were too busy working to care about tabloids.

That made me happy. I loved being treated like everyone else. No special treatment just because of my bank account.

After the calls, I sank onto the couch, grinning. For the first time in weeks, I felt accomplished. Relaxed. Hopeful.

I wanted to dance. The joy was sudden, overwhelming. No reason, just pure, bubbling happiness.

I headed to my room for a shower.

The hot water melted the last of my tension. I lingered under the spray before stepping out.

My closet was packed with new clothes—replacements for the ones Ethan Blackwood had bought. I chose a cream bodycon dress and slipped it on.

The mirror reflected a woman glowing with pregnancy.

I looked damn good.
###Chapter 180

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the hospital corridor as Sophia paced restlessly.

Her fingers trembled as she clutched her phone, the screen still dark. No calls. No messages.

Liam had been missing for hours.

Ethan Blackwood’s voice crackled through the phone when she finally dialed him. "Any news?"

"Nothing yet," he replied, his tone strained. "But we’ll find him."

She wanted to believe him. She had to.

The police had been notified. Daniel Carter, her new partner, was already coordinating a search.

But every passing minute felt like an eternity.

Her mind raced with worst-case scenarios. Had someone taken him? Was this revenge?

A sudden vibration in her hand made her jump.

Unknown number.

Her breath hitched as she answered.

A distorted voice chuckled on the other end. "Looking for someone, Mrs. Blackwood?"

Her blood ran cold.

The line went dead before she could respond.

Sophia’s knees buckled.

This wasn’t a coincidence.

This was a trap.

And Liam was the bait.

I decide to indulge in some self-care today. A soft, natural makeup look—peach-toned lips, subtle bronzer, just enough to enhance my features without being overbearing. My hair, usually straight, gets a playful treatment with curling irons, the waves cascading down my shoulders. Satisfied with my reflection, I slip into my ballet flats, the familiar comfort grounding me.

Just as I reach for the door, my phone vibrates.

An unknown number flashes on the screen.

I hesitate for only a second before answering.

"Hello?"

"Sophia."

That voice. Deep, rough, unmistakable. Even after all this time, it sends a shiver down my spine.

"Daniel," I say, keeping my tone neutral.

I don’t need introductions. His voice is etched into my memory, a relic from a time when his words wrapped around me like warmth. When I believed every syllable.

Before I realized it was all a lie.

I push the thought away.

"How are you?" I ask, forcing calm into my voice.

We haven’t seen each other since… everything. Only letters. Updates about the pregnancy. A detached, clinical exchange between two people who were once inseparable.

"I’m… managing," he says, then silence stretches between us.

It’s strange. There was a time when silence with him was comfortable. Now, it’s suffocating.

"Have you spoken to Victoria and William?" I ask, if only to fill the void.

Calling them mom and dad while talking to him feels wrong. They raised him. Loved him. And now, here we are—expecting a child together, tangled in a mess of betrayal and fractured family ties.

"No," he answers, clipped.

"Why not?" I press. "They’re desperate to hear from you, Daniel. They miss you."

I see it in their eyes, no matter how much they try to hide it. Anger still simmers beneath the surface, yes, but so does love. You don’t just stop loving someone you raised for over two decades.

"You know why," he murmurs, exhaustion lacing his words.

I grit my teeth. "Because of your pride? That’s bullshit, Daniel. They’re hurting. Haven’t you put them through enough?"

Silence.

I exhale sharply. "Just talk to them. Please. I’ve never asked you for anything else."

A heavy sigh. "You know I can’t say no to you, Sophia." A pause. "I’ll reach out."

"Thank you." I don’t let my relief seep into my voice, but I smile. Maybe this is a start.

"That’s not why I called."

"Okay…?"

"I heard about what happened. Are you—are you and the baby alright?" His voice softens, and for a fleeting moment, it’s the Daniel I remember.

The one who made me believe in us.

If only he hadn’t lied.

"We’re fine," I say. "Actually, I have an appointment today. I was just leaving."

A beat. Then—

"Is it strange that I already want to hold her?"

Her?

"You think it’s a girl?"

"Yeah," he admits, almost sheepish. "I’m convinced."

I laugh despite myself. "Well, Liam’s rooting for a girl too."

A quiet chuckle. "Guess I’m not alone. What about you? Boy or girl?"

I don’t hesitate. "It doesn’t matter. I already love them."

And it’s true. The shock of the pregnancy has faded. The anger, the betrayal—none of it changes the fact that this baby is mine.

Just like Liam is mine, no matter what Ethan did.

"I should go," I say. "Don’t want to be late. I’ll write to you after the appointment."

"Sophia—" He hesitates. "About Damien Slade. You don’t need to worry. He won’t touch you. I made sure of it."

Before I can ask what he means, the line goes dead.

I clutch my purse, my mind racing.

What did he do?

Did he threaten him? Bargain? Or something worse?

I shake my head and step outside, the questions lingering like shadows.
